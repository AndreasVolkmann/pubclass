Epidemiology,,,Epidemiological study of paediatric germ cell tumours revealed the incidence and distribution that was expected  but a low mortality rate. Germ cell tumours (GCTs) are a rare heterogeneous tumour group derived from primordial germ cells  which can be benign or malignant and occur in the gonads or extragonadally. This study mapped the paediatric GCTs in Denmark from 1984 to 2013 to study the incidence and outcome. We identified paediatric GCTs from the Danish Childhood Cancer and National Pathology Registries and reviewed the case records for patient characteristics  tumour characteristics and clinical outcome. We identified 403 (71% female) paediatric GCTs and the crude incidence was 1.43 per 100 000. Of these  79 (20%) were malignant  39 (10%) were potentially malignant and 285 (70%) were benign. Extragonadal GCTs (39%) were mainly observed in early childhood and were predominately sacrococcygeal teratomas. Gonadal GCTs (61%) in late childhood were most frequently mature teratomas in the ovaries. Nearly all patients underwent surgery. Of the malignant tumours  62% were treated with chemotherapy. Radiotherapy was only administered to intracranial GCTs. In the cohort  12 patients died (3%). Paediatric GCTs in Denmark were mainly benign and mortality was low  even for malignant tumours. We identified a peak of extragonadal GCTs in early childhood and a peak of gonadal GCTs in late childhood  which was comparable to previous reports.
Patient Education as Topic,,,Study protocol: Rehabilitation including Social and Physical activity and Education in Children and Teenagers with Cancer (RESPECT). During cancer treatment children have reduced contact with their social network of friends  and have limited participation in education  sports  and leisure activities. During and following cancer treatment  children describe school related problems  reduced physical fitness  and problems related to interaction with peers. The RESPECT study is a nationwide population-based prospective  controlled  mixed-methods intervention study looking at children aged 6-18 years newly diagnosed with cancer in eastern Denmark (n=120) and a matched control group in western Denmark (n=120). RESPECT includes Danish-speaking children diagnosed with cancer and treated at pediatric oncology units in Denmark. Primary endpoints are the level of educational achievement one year after the cessation of first-line cancer therapy  and the value of VO2max one year after the cessation of first-line cancer therapy. Secondary endpoints are quality of life measured by validated questionnaires and interviews  and physical performance. RESPECT includes a multimodal intervention program  including ambassador-facilitated educational  physical  and social interventions. The educational intervention includes an educational program aimed at the child with cancer  the child's schoolteachers and classmates  and the child's parents. Children with cancer will each have two ambassadors assigned from their class. The ambassadors visit the child with cancer at the hospital at alternating 2-week intervals and participate in the intervention program. The physical and social intervention examines the effect of early  structured  individualized  and continuous physical activity from diagnosis throughout the treatment period. The patients are tested at diagnosis  at 3 and 6 months after diagnosis  and one year after the cessation of treatment. The study is powered to quantify the impact of the combined educational  physical  and social intervention programs. RESPECT is the first population-based study to examine the effect of early rehabilitation for children with cancer  and to use healthy classmates as ambassadors to facilitate the normalization of social life in the hospital. For children with cancer  RESPECT contributes to expanding knowledge on rehabilitation that can also facilitate rehabilitation of other children undergoing hospitalization for long-term illness.

Pediatrics,Statistics as Topic,,Symptoms and time to diagnosis in children with brain tumours. Clinical symptoms in brain tumours in children are variable at onset and diagnosis is often delayed. Symptoms were investigated with regard to brain tumour localisation  prediagnostic symptomatic intervals and malignancy. Clinical data from children aged 0-17 years from Southern Denmark were analysed retrospectively and the results were correlated with data on prehospital symptoms obtained from interviews with parents and general practitioners. A total of 55 children diagnosed during a period of five years were indentified and 31 interviews were obtained. A total of 19 (41%) of the tumours were supratentorial hemispheric and midline and 27 (59%) were infratentorial. At supratentorial localisations  42% experienced vomiting as their first symptom followed by seizures in 37% and headache in 31%. At infratentorial localisations  headache occurred in 62%  vomiting in 55% and ataxia in 48% of the cases. The prediagnostic symptomatic interval had a median duration of 30 days with vomiting (range 3-330 days)  a median of 75 days with headache (5-730 days) and a median of 75 days with ataxia (1-730 days). Diagnosis is often late in relation to the presenting symptoms. An earlier diagnosis may be achieved if a brain tumour is considered as soon as any child presents with the relevant symptoms.

Immunohistochemistry,,,Relationship of cocaine-induced c-Fos expression to behaviors and the role of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors in cocaine-induced c-Fos expression. Serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonists have been shown to attenuate the locomotor stimulant effects of cocaine in rats. The present study used the expression of c-Fos protein as a marker to identify brain areas through which 5-HT2A receptors may modulate cocaine-induced behaviors. Significant correlations were observed between cocaine-induced hyperactivity and c-Fos expression in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcC)  caudate-putamen (CPu)  and subthalamic nucleus. In a separate experiment  a low  behaviorally relevant dose of cocaine was found to increase c-Fos immunoreactivity in the medial CPu  NAcC  and nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh). The selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist M100907 significantly attenuated cocaine-induced c-Fos expression in the medial CPu and in the NAcSh. These data suggest that 5-HT2A receptors in the NAcSh and CPu or in afferents to these regions may contribute to genomic responses to cocaine in the brain as well as to cocaine-induced locomotor activity.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Surfactant protein D in atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. The collectin surfactant protein-D (SP-D) shows antimicrobial and immuno-regulatory properties and has recently been detected in the basal layers of normal human skin. This molecule potentially plays an important role in inflammatory skin diseases and therefore SP-D content and location was examined using immunohistochemistry on skin biopsies from patients with the two major dermatologic diseases  psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. SP-D was located in the stratum basale of all biopsies with similar intense staining in both diseased and normal skin. Differences were detected in stratum spinosum where involved psoriatic skin showed intense staining through the entire region significantly different from uninvolved and normal skin. Lesional atopic skin showed moderate staining extending through the basal three-fourths of stratum spinosum. Using real time polymerase chain reaction analysis  no substantial up-regulation of SP-D mRNA was detected in lesional psoriatic skin  and a comparison of serum levels of SP-D between patients with atopic dermatitis or psoriasis and a group of age matched healthy controls did not show significant differences. In conclusion SP-D was significantly more abundant in the stratum spinosum of lesional psoriatic and atopic skin due to more cells producing the molecule rather than up-regulation of production in single cells of diseased skin. Further studies are needed to show if SP-D plays a role in the protection against skin infections or modulation of the inflammatory process in these common skin diseases.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Warthin-like papillary renal cell carcinoma: Clinicopathologic  morphologic  immunohistochemical and molecular genetic analysis of 11 cases. Oncocytic papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) is a distinct subtype of PRCC  listed as a possible new variant of PRCC in the 2016 WHO classification. It is composed of papillae aligned by large single-layered eosinophilic cells showing linearly arranged oncocytoma-like nuclei. We analyzed clinicopathologic  morphologic  immunohistochemical and molecular-genetic characteristics of 11 oncocytic PRCCs with prominent tumor lymphocytic infiltrate  morphologically resembling Warthin's tumor. The patients were predominantly males (8/11  73%)  with an average age of 59years (range 14-76)  and a mean tumor size of 7cm (range 1-22cm). Tumors had the features of oncocytic PRCCs with focal pseudostratification in 8/11 cases and showed dense stromal inflammatory infiltration in all cases. Papillary growth pattern was predominant  comprising more than 60% of tumor volume. Tubular and solid components were present in 5 and 3 cases  respectively. Uniform immunohistochemical positivity was found for AMACR  PAX-8  MIA  vimentin  and OSCAR. Tumors were mostly negative for carboanhydrase 9  CD117  CK20  and TTF-1. Immunohistochemical stains for DNA mismatch repair proteins MLH1 and PMS2 were retained in all cases  while MSH2 and MSH6 were negative in 1 case. Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) consisted of both B and T cells. Chromosomal copy number variation analysis showed great variability in 5 cases  ranging from a loss of one single chromosome to complex genome rearrangements. Only one case showed gains of chromosomes 7 and 17  among other aberrations. In 4 cases no numerical imbalance was found. Follow up data was available for 9 patients (median 47.6months  range 1-132). In 6 patients no lethal progression was noted  while 3 died of disease. In conclusion  Warthin-like PRCC is morphologically very close to oncocytic PRCC  from which it differs by the presence of dense lymphoid stroma. Chromosomal numerical aberration pattern of these tumors is variable; only one case showed gains of chromosomes 7 and 17. Warthin-like PRCC is a potentially aggressive tumor since a lethal outcome was recorded in 3/9 cases.
Immunohistochemistry,Pathology  Molecular,,Cystic and necrotic papillary renal cell carcinoma: prognosis  morphology  immunohistochemical  and molecular-genetic profile of 10 cases. Conflicting data have been published on the prognostic significance of tumor necrosis in papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC). Although the presence of necrosis is generally considered an adverse prognostic feature in PRCC  we report a cohort of 10 morphologically distinct cystic and extensively necrotic PRCC with favorable biological behavior. Ten cases of type 1 PRCC with a uniform morphologic pattern were selected from the 19 500 renal tumors  of which 1311 were PRCCs in our registry. We focused on precise morphologic diagnosis supported by immunohistochemical and molecular-genetic analysis. Patients included 8 men and 2 women with an age range of 32-85 years (mean  62.6 years). Tumor size ranged from 6 to 14 cm (mean  9.4 cm). Follow-up data were available in 7 patients  ranging from 0.5 to 14 years (mean  4 years). All tumors were spherical  cystic  and circumscribed by a thick fibrous capsule  filled with hemorrhagic/necrotic contents. Limited viable neoplastic tissue was present only as a thin rim in the inner surface of the cyst wall  consistent with type 1 PRCC. All cases were positive for AMACR  OSCAR  CAM 5.2  HIF-2  and vimentin. Chromosome 7 and 17 polysomy was found in 5 of 9 analyzable cases  2 cases demonstrated chromosome 7 and 17 disomy  and 1 case showed only chromosome 17 polysomy. Loss of chromosome Y was found in 5 cases  including 1 case with disomic chromosomes 7 and 17. No VHL gene abnormalities were found. Papillary renal cell carcinoma type 1 can present as a large hemorrhagic/necrotic unicystic lesion with a thick fibroleiomyomatous capsule. Most cases showed a chromosomal numerical aberration pattern characteristic of PRCC. All tumors followed a nonaggressive clinical course. Large liquefactive necrosis should not necessarily be considered an adverse prognostic feature  particularly in a subset of type 1 PRCC with unilocular cysts filled with necrotic/hemorrhagic material.
Research Design,,,Bacillus Calmette-Guérin immunisation at birth and morbidity among Danish children: A prospective  randomised  clinical trial. Studies from low-income countries report positive non-specific effects of early Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) immunisation on childhood health and survival. Neonatal immunisation with BCG may prime the immune system and offer partial protection against other infectious and possibly allergic diseases. The potential clinical value of these non-specific effects has not yet been examined in a large randomised trial in high-income countries. The Danish Calmette Study is a multicentre randomised clinical trial conducted between October 2012 and November 2015. Within the first 7 days of life  infants were randomly assigned to intra-dermal vaccination with BCG or no intervention. At 3 and 13 months of age structured telephone interviews and clinical examinations of the children were conducted. In a subgroup of children blood samples were drawn and stool samples collected at age 4 days  3 and 13 months. Thymus index was assessed by ultrasound in a subgroup at randomisation and at 3 months. The primary study outcome is hospitalisation within the first 15 months of life as assessed in Danish health registers. Secondary outcomes include infectious disease hospitalisations  wheezing  eczema  use of prescribed medication  growth  development  thymus index  T- and B-cell subpopulations assessed by flow cytometry  in vitro cytokine responses and specific antibody responses to other vaccines. Adverse reactions were registered. With participation of 4184 families and more than 93% adherence to clinical follow-up at 3 and 13 months  this randomised clinical trial has the potential to create evidence regarding non-specific effects of BCG vaccination in a high-income setting.
Qualitative Research,,,Disappointment and adherence among parents of newborns allocated to the control group: a qualitative study of a randomized clinical trial. When a child participates in a clinical trial  informed consent has to be given by the parents. Parental motives for participation are complex  but the hope of getting a new and better treatment for the child is important. We wondered how parents react when their child is allocated to the control group of a randomized controlled trial  and how it will affect their future engagement in the trial. We included parents of newborns randomized to the control arm in the Danish Calmette study at Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen. The Calmette study is a randomized clinical trial investigating the non-specific effects of early BCG-vaccine to healthy neonates. Randomization is performed immediately after birth and parents are not blinded to the allocation. We set up a semi-structured focus group with six parents from four families. Afterwards we telephone-interviewed another 19 mothers to achieve saturation. Thematic analysis was used to identify themes across the data sets. The parents reported good understanding of the randomization process. Their most common reaction to allocation was disappointment  though relief was also seen. A model of reactions to being allocated to the control group was developed based on the participants' different positions along two continuities from 'Our participation in trial is not important' to 'Our participation in trial is important'  and 'Vaccine not important to us' to 'Vaccine important to us'. Four very disappointed families had thought of getting the vaccine elsewhere  and one had actually had their child vaccinated. All parents involved in the focus group and the telephone interviews wanted to participate in the follow-ups planned for the Calmette study. This study identified an almost universal experience of disappointment among parents of newborns who were randomized to the control group  but also a broad expression of understanding and accepting the idea of randomization. The trial staff might use the model of reactions in understanding the parents' disappointment and in this way support their motives for participation. A generalized version might be applicable across randomized controlled trials at large. The Calmette study is registered in EudraCT (https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/) with trial number 2010-021979-85.
Pharmacology  Clinical,Specialization,,Characteristics and apprehensions of clinical pharmacologists in Swedish healthcare--a questionnaire study. To describe the discipline clinical pharmacology of today in the Swedish healthcare system from the performers' point of view. A questionnaire was administered in December 2012 to physicians working within the specialty clinical pharmacology in the Swedish healthcare system (7 sites; 1-26 physicians per site). The questionnaire included questions pertaining to the characteristics of the responder and statements to which the responder indicated his/her level of agreement using a score ranging from 1 (total disagreement) to 5 (total agreement). A total of 61 completed questionnaires were returned (response rate: 97 %; 55 % male; 74 % specialists and/or consultants). In the preceding month  79 % of the responders had performed educational activities  74 % had functioned as an "expert"  and 75 % had performed research. The academic merits of the responders were high  with 72 % having at least a PhD degree and 23 % being professors. Among those performing research  the focus of 83 % was related to the field of clinical pharmacology  with the main sub-areas being pharmacoepidemiology (59 %) and/or pharmacogenetics (41 %). Regarding the apprehension questions  the responders strongly agreed that the specialty clinical pharmacology meets a need in the healthcare system (4.5 ± 0.7)  that they wanted to continue to work within the specialty (4.5 ± 0.7)  that their personal professional prospects were good (3.9 ± 1.0)  and that they would recommend a colleague to specialize within the field (3.9 ± 1.1). The responders from the largest and first established site (Karolinska University Hospital) agreed with these points to a significantly greater extent than responders from other sites. The majority of the performers of clinical pharmacology in Swedish healthcare consider this specialty to be important to the medical community. By carrying out educational activities  providing expertise  and performing research  the performers seem to be content with their work and future prospects. Performers within the largest and oldest site in Sweden  generally held the most positive view of the specialty.
Rheology,,,Skin circulation in the nipple after reduction mammaplasty by upper and lower glandular resections. Avascular necrosis of the nipple is a serious complication of reduction mammaplasty with nipple transposition. A study was undertaken to measure the skin circulation in the nipple before  during and after this operation. In 14 patients undergoing a reduction mammaplasty according to the method of Strömbeck  the skin circulation was measured in 25 breasts with laser doppler flowmetry (LDF) and fluorescein flowmetry (FF). LDF showed that the skin circulation increased after de-epithelialization to 204.4 +/- 31.0% of the preoperative value (100%) (mean +/- SEM  p less than 0.01). After the upper and lower glandular resection the circulation was reduced to 90.7 +/- 12.3% of the preoperative value. The division of the lateral pedicle did not affect the circulation. After the skin had been sutured  the circulation was 71.5 +/- 9.1% of the preoperative value (p less than 0.01). One to four days postoperatively the circulation was 100.3 +/- 13.2% of the preoperative value. At FF uniform fluorescence was observed in the nipple postoperatively in all patients but two  in whom avascular necrosis later developed. Our results thus show that the circulation in the nipple after reduction mammaplasty by the Strömbeck method is adequate and that it is safe to divide the lateral dermal pedicle.
Crystallography,,,Crystal structure of the ligand binding domain of the human nuclear receptor PPARgamma. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) are members of the nuclear receptor supergene family and are considered as key sensors of both lipid and glucose homeostasis. The role of the PPARgamma isoform in glucose metabolism is illustrated by the fact that anti-diabetic thiazolidinediones have been shown to be bona fide PPARgamma ligands. Here we report the crystal structure of apo-PPARgamma ligand binding domain (LBD) determined to 2.9-A resolution. Although the structure of apo-PPARgamma-LBD retains the overall fold described previously for other nuclear receptor LBDs  three distinct structural differences are evident. 1) The core AF-2 activation domain of apo-PPARgamma LBD is folded back toward the predicted ligand binding pocket similar to that observed in the holo-forms of other nuclear receptors. 2) The proposed ligand binding pocket of apo-PPARgamma-LBD is larger and more accessible to the surface in contrast to other LBDs. 3) The region of the LBD called the omega-loop is extended in PPARgamma and contains additional structural elements. Taken together  the apo-PPARgamma-LBD structure is in several aspects different from previously described LBDs. Given the central role of PPARgamma as a mediator in glucose regulation  the structure should be an important tool in the development of improved anti-diabetic agents.
Allergy and Immunology,,,Direct and competitive kinetic analysis of the interaction between human IgG1 and a one domain analogue of protein A. Direct and competitive kinetic analysis of the binding between a one domain analogue of protein A  and mutants thereof  to immobilised hIgG1 was compared using a biosensor system based on surface plasmon resonance detection. Rate constants determined from both assays were almost identical. The experiments demonstrate that competitive kinetic analysis can be used in combination with biosensor technology  and indicate that competitive kinetic analysis may extend the use of the technology to include low molecular weight analytes.
Proteomics,,,Retinal proteome changes following experimental branch retinal vein occlusion and intervention with ranibizumab. Animal models of experimental branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) provide a unique opportunity to study protein changes directly in retinal tissue. Results from these experimental models suggest that experimental BRVO is associated with an upregulation of extracellular matrix remodeling and adhesion signaling processes. To study whether these processes could be blocked by inhibition of VEGF-A  a porcine model of experimental BRVO was combined with proteomic analyses. In six Danish Landrace pigs experimental BRVO was induced with argon laser in both eyes. After 24 h an injection of 0.05 mL ranibizumab was given in the right eyes of the animals while left eyes received an injection of 0.05 mL 9 mg/mL sodium chloride water. Retinas were dissected three days after BRVO and the retinal samples were analyzed with label-free quantification as well as tandem mass tag based proteomics. In retinas treated with ranibizumab five proteins exhibited statistically significant changes in content with both proteomic techniques. These five proteins  which were all decreased in content  included integrin β-1  peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase  OCIA domain-containing protein 1  calnexin and 40S ribosomal protein S5. As anti-integrin therapies are under development for inhibition of angiogenesis in retinal diseases it is interesting that inhibition of VEGF-A in itself resulted in a small decrease in the content of integrin β-1. The decreased content of integrin β-1 indicates that extracellular matrix remodeling and adhesion processes associated with BRVO are at least partly reversed through inhibition of VEGF-A.
Research Design,,,The chronic autoimmune thyroiditis quality of life selenium trial (CATALYST): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial. Patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis have impaired health-related quality of life. The thyroid gland has a high selenium concentration  and specific selenoprotein enzyme families are crucial to immune function  and catalyze thyroid hormone metabolism and redox processes in thyroid cells. Previous randomized controlled trials have found that selenium supplementation decreases thyroid-disease-specific antibody levels. We hypothesize that selenium might be beneficial in the treatment of chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. The CATALYST trial is an investigator-initiated randomized  blinded  multicentre clinical trial of selenium supplementation versus placebo in patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. age ≥18 years; serum thyroid peroxidase antibody level ≥100 IU/ml within the previous 12 months; treatment with levothyroxine and written informed consent. previous diagnosis of toxic nodular goitre  Graves' hyperthyroidism  postpartum thyroiditis  Graves' orbitopathy; previous antithyroid drug treatment  radioiodine therapy or thyroid surgery; immune-modulatory or other medication affecting thyroid function; pregnancy  planned pregnancy or breastfeeding; allergy towards any intervention or placebo component; intake of selenium supplementation >55 μg/day; inability to read or understand Danish or lack of informed consent. The trial will include 2 × 236 participants. The experimental intervention and control groups will receive 200 μg selenium-enriched yeast or matching placebo tablets daily for 12 months. The experimental supplement will be SelenoPrecise®. The primary outcome is thyroid-related quality of life assessed by the Thyroid Patient-Reported Outcome (ThyPRO) questionnaire. Secondary outcomes include serum thyroid peroxidase antibody concentration; serum triiodothyronine/thyroxine ratio; levothyroxine dosage; adverse reactions and serious adverse reactions and events. In this pragmatic trial  participating patients follow their usual treatment at their usual hospitals. In order to collect high-quality data on the clinical course and quality of life  and to minimize missing data  an elaborate trial management system has been designed. 12 months intervention duration was selected in consideration of the primary outcome  thyroid-related quality of life. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02013479.
Research Design,,,Selenium supplementation for patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism (the GRASS trial): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial. Graves' hyperthyroidism is an autoimmune disease causing hyperfunction of the thyroid gland. The concentration of selenium is high in the thyroid gland and two important groups of enzymes within the thyroid are selenoproteins  that is  they depend on selenium. Selenium may have beneficial effects on autoimmune hypothyroidism and on Graves' orbitopathy  but the effects of selenium on Graves' hyperthyroidism is unknown.We hypothesize that adjuvant selenium may be beneficial in the treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism. The objective is to investigate if selenium supplementation plus standard treatment with anti-thyroid drugs versus standard treatment with anti-thyroid drugs will lead to a decrease in anti-thyroid drug treatment failure (that is  failure to remain euthyroid  without further treatment  one year after cessation of anti-thyroid drug treatment)  faster and longer lasting remission (that is  anti-thyroid drug treatment success)  and improved quality of life in patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism. The trial is an investigator-initiated  randomised  blinded  multicentre clinical trial. Inclusion criteria are: age 18 years or older; diagnosis of active Graves' hyperthyroidism within the last two months; and informed consent. Exclusion criteria are major co-morbidity; previous radioactive iodine treatment; ongoing anti-thyroid drug treatment for more than two months; treatment with immunomodulatory drugs; known allergy towards the components in the selenium and placebo pills; pregnancy or breast-feeding; and intake of selenium supplementation above 70 μg per day. We plan to include 492 participants  randomised (1:1) to two tablets of 100 μg selenium once daily for the 24 to 30 months intervention period versus two identical placebo tablets once daily.The primary outcome is the proportion of participants with anti-thyroid drug treatment failure (see above) at the end of the intervention period (24 to 30 months). Secondary outcomes are: thyroid-specific quality of life during the first year after randomisation; level of thyroid stimulating hormone-receptor antibodies at 18 months after randomisation and at the end of the intervention period (24 to 30 months); hyperthyroid symptoms during the first year after randomisation; eye symptoms during the first year after randomisation  and at the end of the intervention period (24 to 30 months); adverse reactions during the intervention period; and serious adverse events during the intervention period. It was of great importance to the initiators of this trial  that the results would be directly applicable to daily clinical practice. Therefore  it was designed as a pragmatic trial: the patients follow their usual treatment at their usual hospitals. In order to still collect high quality data on the clinical course and quality of life  an elaborate trial management system was designed to keep track of patient input  need for trial personnel input and action  and to collect data from medical chart systems. Meticulous follow-up on missing responses to the QoL measurements has been incorporated into the system  to minimise missing quality of life data. Monitoring of adverse reactions and events is achieved by thorough instruction of the participants  surveillance of patient-reported outcomes  and integration with national databases regarding hospitalizations. A very long intervention period was necessary  since patients are not considered in remission until one year after stopping anti-thyroid drugs. Usually  patients are treated for 12 to 18 months with anti-thyroid drugs  yielding a total intervention period of 24 to 30 months. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01611896.
Soil Microbiology,Ecotoxicology,,Limited recovery of soil microbial activity after transient exposure to gasoline vapors. During gasoline spills complex mixtures of toxic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are released to terrestrial environments. Gasoline VOCs exert baseline toxicity (narcosis) and may thus broadly affect soil biota. We assessed the functional resilience (i.e. resistance and recovery of microbial functions) in soil microbial communities transiently exposed to gasoline vapors by passive dosing via headspace for 40 days followed by a recovery phase of 84 days. Chemical exposure was characterized with GC-MS  whereas microbial activity was monitored as soil respiration (CO2 release) and soil bacterial growth ([(3)H]leucine incorporation). Microbial activity was strongly stimulated and inhibited at low and high exposure levels  respectively. Microbial growth efficiency decreased with increasing exposure  but rebounded during the recovery phase for low-dose treatments. Although benzene  toluene  ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) concentrations decreased by 83-97% during the recovery phase  microbial activity in high-dose treatments did not recover and numbers of viable bacteria were 3-4 orders of magnitude lower than in control soil. Re-inoculation with active soil microorganisms failed to restore microbial activity indicating residual soil toxicity  which could not be attributed to BTEX  but rather to mixture toxicity of more persistent gasoline constituents or degradation products. Our results indicate a limited potential for functional recovery of soil microbial communities after transient exposure to high  but environmentally relevant  levels of gasoline VOCs which therefore may compromise ecosystem services provided by microorganisms even after extensive soil VOC dissipation.
Metabolomics,,,Evaluation of chromatographic conditions in reversed phase liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry systems for fingerprinting of polar and amphiphilic plant metabolites. Metabolic fingerprinting is a relatively young scientific discipline requiring robust  yet flexible and fit-for-purpose analytical methods. Here  we introduce a simple approach to select reversed phase LC systems with electrospray MS detection for fingerprinting of polar and amphiphilic plant metabolites. The approach does not rely on isotopic labeling or biological origin of sample constituent and can also be used for non-biological matrices (e.g.  oil or sewage sludge) or for other optimization purposes (e.g.  mass spectrometric source parameterization). The LC systems varied in column chemistry and temperature  mobile phase pH/additive  gradient steepness/eluotropic strength  and electrospray mode of operation. The systems were evaluated based on the number of features detected using the matchedFilter algorithm from XCMS and the repeatability of this detection across analytical replicates. For negative ion mode detection  the best performances were obtained with an HSS T3 column operated at low pH  which produced a 3-fold increase in the number of reliable features extracted compared with the worst system. The best system for positive ion mode (i.e.  the BEH C18 column operated at intermediate pH) only produced a 50 % increase in the number of reliable features. The data also indicate that baseline removal is unavoidable for reliable intensity estimations using peak areas  and that peak heights may be a more robust measure of intensity when baselines cannot be completely removed or in case of coelution  fronting or tailing.
Epidemiology,,,Varicella in Europe-A review of the epidemiology and experience with vaccination. There is no consensus as regards the European varicella immunisation policy; some countries have introduced varicella vaccination in their routine childhood immunisation programs whereas others have decided against or are debating. With the aim of providing an overview of the epidemiology of varicella in Europe and addressing the different strategies and the experiences so far  we performed a review of epidemiological studies done in Europe from 2004 to 2014. Varicella is mainly a disease of childhood  but sero-epidemiological studies show regional differences in the proportion of susceptible adults. Hospitalisation due to varicella is not common  but complications and hospitalisation mainly affect previously healthy children  which underlines the importance of not dismissing varicella as a disease of little importance. The experience with universal vaccination in Europe shows that vaccination leads to a rapid reduction of disease incidence. Vaccine effectiveness is high and a protective herd effect is obtained. Experience with vaccination in Europe has not been long enough  though  to draw conclusions on benefits and drawbacks with vaccination as well as the capacity for national programs in Europe to maintain a sufficiently high coverage to prevent a change in age group distribution to older children and young adults or on the impact that varicella immunisation may have on the epidemiology of shingles.
Clinical Competence,Pediatrics,Teaching,Implementing video cases in clinical paediatric teaching increases medical students' self-assessed confidence. Use of video cases in clinical education is rarely used systematically. Medical students (n = 127) reported by questionnaire whether they had or had not seen a bedside case of each of 22 specific clinical conditions during their five-week clinical course in paediatrics in seven centres. A video case library showing children with common clinical conditions was established  and a short video was added to the oral examination. We evaluated students' and internal and external examiners' perceptions by questionnaires. A total of 81% of the students reported having seen a child with asthma in the daily clinic. In contrast  respiratory syncytial virus infection was only seen by 20%. Students' self-reported confidence in the assessment of paediatric patients increased after the video case library was made available: Before the intervention  41% (57/138) of the students reported confidence at a score of 5-7 on a seven-point Likert scale. This increased to 64% (186/289) (p < 0.0001) after the introduction of the video case library. Before  84% (116/138) of the students judged the impact of video cases to be high (score 5-7 on a seven-point Likert scale) and after the intervention  this share was 75% (218/289) (p = 0.06). Furthermore  internal as well as external examiners found video cases valuable  but the use of videos did not change the average examination grade. A video case supplement to teaching in clinical paediatrics was considered to be of value for teaching. We were successful in establishing an educational resource that students considered useful. Internal and external examiners found that a short video case was a valuable supplementary tool during the oral examination. The University of Copenhagen funded the study. not relevant.
Patient Education as Topic,Telemedicine,,E-health empowers patients with ulcerative colitis: a randomised controlled trial of the web-guided 'Constant-care' approach. The natural history of ulcerative colitis requires continuous monitoring of medical treatment via frequent outpatient visits. The European health authorities' focus on e-health is increasing. Lack of easy access to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) clinics  patients' education and understanding of the importance of early treatment at relapse is leading to poor compliance. To overcome these limitations a randomised control trial 'Constant-care' was undertaken in Denmark and Ireland. 333 patients with mild/moderate ulcerative colitis and 5-aminosalicylate acid treatment were randomised to either a web-group receiving disease specific education and self-treatment via http://www.constant-care.dk or a control group continuing the usual care for 12 months. A historical control group was included to test the comparability with the control group. We investigated: feasibility of the approach  its influence on patients' compliance  knowledge  quality of life (QoL)  disease outcomes  safety and health care costs. 88% of the web patients preferred using the new approach. Adherence to 4 weeks of acute treatment was increased by 31% in Denmark and 44% in Ireland compared to the control groups. In Denmark IBD knowledge and QoL were significantly improved in web patients. Median relapse duration was 18 days (95% CI 10 to 21) in the web versus 77 days (95% CI 46 to 108) in the control group. The number of acute and routine visits to the outpatient clinic was lower in the web than in the control group  resulting in a saving of 189 euro/patient/year. No difference in the relapse frequency  hospitalisation  surgery or adverse events was observed. The historical control group was comparable with the control group. The new web-guided approach on http://www.constant-care.dk is feasible  safe and cost effective. It empowers patients with ulcerative colitis without increasing their morbidity and depression. It has yet to be shown whether this strategy can change the natural disease course of ulcerative colitis in the long term.
Computer-Assisted Instruction,Patient Education as Topic,,Development of a Web-based concept for patients with ulcerative colitis and 5-aminosalicylic acid treatment. Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a lifelong disease with increasing incidence. UC requires frequent outpatient clinic visits and continuous medical treatment. Web-based self-management in other chronic diseases influences disease course  and increases self-adherence  compliance and quality of life (QoL). Lack of easy access to inflammatory bowel disease clinics and patient education  their understanding of the importance of early treatment at relapse  poor compliance and self-adherence can be partly solved by a newly developed Web-based concept. To describe the development and validation of the Web-based 'Constant-Care' concept. A Web-based treatment program (www.constant-care.dk) and a Patient Educational Centre for UC patients were developed. The feasibility and acceptance of the concept was validated before (group A) and 6 months after (group B) the start of a randomized controlled trial. Patients' level of disease-specific knowledge  QoL  anxiety and depression were evaluated. Ten (group A) and 11 (group B) patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of mild-to-moderate UC participated in the study. All patients reported an ability to initiate self-treatment after the educational training (ET). A significant increase in knowledge from 36 to 69% (group A) and 28 to 75% (group B) was obtained. A majority of the patients were satisfied with the ET. Patients' QoL  anxiety  depression and general well-being showed no difference after the ET. Patient education and training through a Web-based program (www.constant-care.dk) seems to be a feasible concept for increasing patients' ability to self-initiate treatment and increase the level of disease-specific knowledge. Relevant adjustment of the concept was implemented. The final outcome of the 'Constant-Care' concept is pending.
Proteomics,,,Oxyntomodulin Identified as a Marker of Type 2 Diabetes and Gastric Bypass Surgery by Mass-spectrometry Based Profiling of Human Plasma. Low-abundance regulatory peptides  including metabolically important gut hormones  have shown promising therapeutic potential. Here  we present a streamlined mass spectrometry-based platform for identifying and characterizing low-abundance regulatory peptides in humans. We demonstrate the clinical applicability of this platform by studying a hitherto neglected glucose- and appetite-regulating gut hormone  namely  oxyntomodulin. Our results show that the secretion of oxyntomodulin in patients with type 2 diabetes is significantly impaired  and that its level is increased by more than 10-fold after gastric bypass surgery. Furthermore  we report that oxyntomodulin is co-distributed and co-secreted with the insulin-stimulating and appetite-regulating gut hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)  is inactivated by the same protease (dipeptidyl peptidase-4) as GLP-1 and acts through its receptor. Thus  oxyntomodulin may participate with GLP-1 in the regulation of glucose metabolism and appetite in humans. In conclusion  this mass spectrometry-based platform is a powerful resource for identifying and characterizing metabolically active low-abundance peptides.
Schools,,,Fitness Effects of 10-Month Frequent Low-Volume Ball Game Training or Interval Running for 8-10-Year-Old School Children. We investigated the exercise intensity and fitness effects of frequent school-based low-volume high-intensity training for 10 months in 8-10-year-old children. 239 Danish 3rd-grade school children from four schools were cluster-randomised into a control group (CON  n = 116) or two training groups performing either 5 × 12 min/wk small-sided football plus other ball games (SSG  n = 62) or interval running (IR  n = 61). Whole-body DXA scans  flamingo balance  standing long-jump  20 m sprint  and Yo-Yo IR1 children's tests (YYIR1C) were performed before and after the intervention. Mean running velocity was higher (p < 0.05) in SSG than in IR (0.88 ± 0.14 versus 0.63 ± 0.20 m/s)  while more time (p < 0.05) was spent in the highest player load zone (>2; 5.6 ± 3.4 versus 3.7 ± 3.4%) and highest HR zone (>90% HRmax; 12.4 ± 8.9 versus 8.4 ± 8.0%) in IR compared to SSG. After 10 months  no significant between-group differences were observed for YYIR1C performance and HR after 2 min of YYIR1C (HRsubmax)  but median-split analyses showed that HRsubmax was reduced (p < 0.05) in both training groups compared to CON for those with the lowest aerobic fitness (SSG versus CON: 3.2%  HRmax [95% CI: 0.8-5.5]; IR versus CON: 2.6%  HRmax [95% CI: 1.1-5.2]). After 10 months  IR had improved (p < 0.05) 20 m sprint performance (IR versus CON: 154 ms [95% CI: 61-241]). No between-group differences (p > 0.05) were observed for whole-body or leg aBMD  lean mass  postural balance  or jump length. In conclusion  frequent low-volume ball games and interval running can be conducted over a full school year with high intensity rate but has limited positive fitness effects in 8-10-year-old children.
Chemistry  Pharmaceutical,,,Selected HIV-1 Env trimeric formulations act as potent immunogens in a rabbit vaccination model. Ten to 30% of HIV-1 infected subjects develop broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) during chronic infection. We hypothesized that immunizing rabbits with viral envelope glycoproteins (Envs) from these patients may induce bNAbs  when formulated as a trimeric protein and in the presence of an adjuvant. Based on in vitro neutralizing activity in serum  patients with bNAbs were selected for cloning of their HIV-1 Env. Seven stable soluble trimeric gp140 proteins were generated from sequences derived from four adults and two children infected with either clade A or B HIV-1. From one of the clade A Envs both the monomeric and trimeric Env were produced for comparison. Rabbits were immunized with soluble gp120 or trimeric gp140 proteins in combination with the adjuvant dimethyl dioctadecyl ammonium/trehalose dibehenate (CAF01). Env binding in rabbit immune serum was determined using ELISAs based on gp120-IIIB protein. Neutralizing activity of IgG purified from rabbit immune sera was measured with the pseudovirus-TZMbl assay and a PBMC-based neutralization assay for selected experiments. It was initially established that gp140 trimers induce better antibody responses over gp120 monomers and that the adjuvant CAF01 was necessary for such strong responses. Gp140 trimers  based on HIV-1 variants from patients with bNAbs  were able to elicit both gp120IIIB specific IgG and NAbs to Tier 1 viruses of different subtypes. Potency of NAbs closely correlated with titers  and an gp120-binding IgG titer above a threshold of 100 000 was predictive of neutralization capability. Finally  peptide inhibition experiments showed that a large fraction of the neutralizing IgG was directed against the gp120 V3 region. Our results indicate that the strategy of reverse immunology based on selected Env sequences is promising when immunogens are delivered as stabilized trimers in CAF01 adjuvant and that the rabbit is a valuable model for HIV vaccine studies.
Research Design,,,A phase II randomized clinical trial on cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy plus a treatment guideline versus treatment as usual for extremely preterm infants during the first three days of life (SafeBoosC): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial. Every year in Europe about 25 000 infants are born extremely preterm. These infants have a 20% mortality rate  and 25% of survivors have severe long-term cerebral impairment. Preventative measures are key to reduce mortality and morbidity in an extremely preterm population. The primary objective of the SafeBoosC phase II trial is to examine if it is possible to stabilize the cerebral oxygenation of extremely preterm infants during the first 72 hours of life through the application of cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) oximetry and implementation of an clinical treatment guideline based on intervention thresholds of cerebral regional tissue saturation rStO2. SafeBoosC is a randomized  blinded  multinational  phase II clinical trial. The inclusion criteria are: neonates born more than 12 weeks preterm; decision to conduct full life support; parental informed consent; and possibility to place the cerebral NIRS oximeter within 3 hours after birth. The infants will be randomized into one of two groups. Both groups will have a cerebral oximeter monitoring device placed within three hours of birth. In the experimental group  the cerebral oxygenation reading will supplement the standard treatment using a predefined treatment guideline. In the control group  the cerebral oxygenation reading will not be visible and the infant will be treated according to the local standards. The primary outcome is the multiplication of the duration and magnitude of rStO2 values outside the target ranges of 55% to 85%  that is  the 'burden of hypoxia and hyperoxia' expressed in '%hours'. To detect a 50% difference between the experimental and control group in %hours  166 infants in total must be randomized. Secondary outcomes are mortality at term date  cerebral ultrasound score  and interburst intervals on an amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram at 64 hours of life and explorative outcomes include neurodevelopmental outcome at 2 years corrected age  magnetic resonance imaging at term  blood biomarkers at 6 and 64 hours after birth  and adverse events. Cerebral oximetry guided interventions have the potential to improve neurodevelopmental outcome in extremely preterm infants. It is a logical first step to test if it is possible to reduce the burden of hypoxia and hyperoxia. ClinicalTrial.gov  NCT01590316.
Education,,,Mindfulness predicts student nurses' communication self-efficacy: A cross-national comparative study. The aim of this study was to compare student nurses' communication self-efficacy  empathy  and mindfulness across two countries  and to analyse the relationship between these qualities. The study had a cross-sectional design. Data was collected from final year student nurses in Norway and Sweden. Communication self-efficacy  empathy  and mindfulness were reported by questionnaires; Clear-cut communication with patients  Jefferson Scale of Empathy  and Langer 14 items mindfulness scale. The study included 156 student nurses  94 (60%) were Swedish. The mean communication self-efficacy score was 119 (95% CI 116-122)  empathy score 115 (95% CI 113-117) and mindfulness score 79 (95% CI 78-81). A Mann-Whitney test showed that Swedish students scored significantly higher on communication self-efficacy  empathy  and mindfulness than Norwegian students did. When adjusted for age  gender  and country in a multiple linear regression  mindfulness was the only independent predictor of communication self-efficacy. The Swedish student nurses in this study scored higher on communication self-efficacy  empathy  and mindfulness than Norwegian students did. Student nurses scoring high on mindfulness rated their communication self-efficacy higher. A mindful learning approach may improve communication self-efficacy and possibly the effect of communication skills training.
Evidence-Based Dentistry,,,Treatment of adult patients with partial edentulism: a systematic review. The purpose of this systematic review was to identify and critically appraise published studies of treatment methods used in general practice to rehabilitate adult patients with single tooth loss or partial edentulism  with special emphasis on outcomes reported after at least 5 years of follow-up. Three databases were searched using specified indexing terms. Publications were included if the study design  research questions  and sample size satisfied pre-established criteria. Reference lists of relevant publications and systematic reviews were also searched. The quality of evidence was classified according to the GRADE system as high  moderate  low  or very low. The search yielded 7 675 titles  of which 1 130 were read in full text. A final total of 15 publications were deemed eligible for inclusion: 5 of moderate quality and 10 of low quality. The five studies of moderate quality were all related to implant-based treatment. The 5-year survival rates for implant-supported single crowns and prostheses were 91% and 94.7%  respectively (implant survival rates: 98.5% and 94.9%  respectively). The underlying scientific evidence was low in quality. No relevant publications were identified regarding the economic aspects of treatment. Due to the low scientific evidence of the included studies  it was not possible to compare various treatment methods used for rehabilitation of single tooth loss or partial edentulism.
Evidence-Based Dentistry,,,Treatment of adult patients with edentulous arches: a systematic review. This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of treatment methods used to rehabilitate adult patients with maxillary and/or mandibular edentulism after at least 5 years of follow-up. The risks  adverse effects  and cost effectiveness of these methods were also evaluated. Three databases as well as the reference lists of included publications were searched using specified indexing terms. Publications that met the inclusion criteria were read and interpreted using pre-established protocols. Quality of evidence was classified according to the GRADE system (high  moderate  low  or very low). The search yielded 2 130 titles and abstracts. Of these  the full-text versions of 488 publications were obtained. After data extraction and interpretation  10 studies with moderate study quality of evidence and 1 study with low quality of evidence regarding outcomes  risks  and adverse effects remained. Three studies on the economic aspects of treatment were also included (1 with moderate quality and 2 with low quality). Low-quality evidence showed that the survival rate of implant-supported fixed prostheses is 95% after 5 years in patients with maxillary edentulism and 97% after 10 years in patients with mandibular edentulism. The survival rate of implant-supported overdentures is 93% after 5 years (low-quality evidence). In implant-supported fixed prostheses  70 of every 1 000 implants are at risk of failing in the maxilla after 5 years and 17 of every 1 000 implants in the mandible are at risk after 10 years. Regarding economic aspects  the evidence was insufficient to provide reliable results. Due to the low quality of evidence found in the included studies  further research with a higher quality of evidence is recommended to better understand the outcomes of treatment for patients with maxillary and/or mandibular edentulism.
Dental Research,,,A study on variances in multivariate analyses of oral implant outcome. Elaborate studies have shown that interdependency exists between implants being placed in the same patient/jaw. Therefore  interdependency ought to be an important aspect to address  whenever performing statistical analyses of oral implant outcomes. A Jackknife method could be an option when conducting statistical evaluations of oral implant failure prognoses. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a statistical difference can be detected by using the Jackknife method in conjunction with life table analyses and/or a log rank test of four different combinations of jaw density and quantity. Four multicenter studies were pooled and adjusted in order to create a research database consisting of 486 patients and 1 737 implants in preparation for the Jackknife resampling method. Combinations of jaw shapes and bone qualities were constructed to select at-risk patients. Life tables with confidence intervals were calculated and a log rank test was used to determine whether a statistical difference between the combinations could be established. Both statistical analyses  after the Jackknife resampling method  showed that patients with poor bone quality and resorbed jaws (combination IV) had a statistically higher risk of implant failure. By rearranging data using the Jackknife method  standardized statistical tests seem to work well even when the study population tested was affected by interdependency.
Epidemiology,,,Weight change and risk of hyperglycaemia in elderly women. Hyperglycaemia increases the risk of type 2 diabetes  heart disease and stroke  and is influenced by weight. However  the impact of preceding weight change on blood glycemia levels in late-life is less well understood. We studied the interplay between weight change and risk of hyperglycaemia in a prospective cohort of elderly women. Elderly Caucasian women (age: 67.1 years at baseline  n = 1173) enrolled in the Prospective Epidemiological Risk Factor study with baseline and 13-year follow-up measurements of BMI and fasting glucose levels (FPG) and no previous history of diabetes or impaired fasting glucose. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine risk of hyperglycaemia (FPG ≥ 5.6 mmol/L or HbA1c ≥ 42 mmol/mol) in normalweight (BMI ≤ 25 kg/m(2))  overweight (BMI = 25-29.9 kg/m(2)) and obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2)) women who either lost weight  were weight-stable or had gained weight at follow-up. Overweight and obese elderly women who had gained weight at follow-up presented an increased risk of hyperglycaemia  OR = 2.7 (1.6-4.6) and OR = 3.2 (1.5-6.8)  compared to weight-stable normalweight women. Overweight and obese women who lost weight decreased their risk of hyperglycaemia to a level comparable to weight-stable normalweight women. Overweight and obese women with stable weight presented a two-fold increased risk of hyperglycaemia compared to normalweight weight-stable women. Losing weight in late life had a positive effect on the risk of hyperglycaemia in overweight and obese women  while further  weight gain increased the risk of hyperglycaemia. The study highlights that strategies to reduce weight in obese and overweight elderly women could have a positive influence on disease burden in late-life.
Research Design,,,Study protocol  rationale and recruitment in a European multi-centre randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy and safety of azithromycin maintenance therapy for 6 months in primary ciliary dyskinesia. Clinical management of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) respiratory disease is currently based on improving mucociliary clearance and controlling respiratory infections  through the administration of antibiotics. Treatment practices in PCD are largely extrapolated from more common chronic respiratory disorders  particularly cystic fibrosis  but no randomized controlled trials (RCT) have ever evaluated efficacy and safety of any pharmacotherapeutics used in the treatment of PCD. Maintenance therapy  with the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin  is currently widely used in chronic respiratory diseases including PCD. In addition to its antibacterial properties  azithromycin is considered to have beneficial anti-inflammatory and anti-quorum-sensing properties. The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of azithromycin maintenance therapy for 6 months on respiratory exacerbations in PCD. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of azithromycin on lung function  ventilation inhomogeneity  hearing impairment  and symptoms (respiratory  sinus  ears and hearing) measured on a PCD-specific health-related quality of life instrument  and to assess the safety of azithromycin maintenance therapy in PCD. The BESTCILIA trial is a European multi-centre  double-blind  randomized  placebo-controlled  parallel group study. The intervention is tablets of azithromycin 250/500 mg according to body weight or placebo administered three times a week for 6 months. Subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of PCD  age 7-50 years  are eligible for inclusion. Chronic pulmonary infections with Gram-negative bacteria or any recent occurrence of non-tuberculous mycobacteria are exclusion criteria. The planned number of subjects to be included is 125. The trial has been approved by the Research Ethics Committees of the participating institutions. We present a study protocol of an ongoing RCT  evaluating for the first time  the efficacy and safety of a pharmacotherapeutic treatment for patients with PCD. The RCT evaluates azithromycin maintenance therapy  a drug already commonly prescribed in other chronic respiratory disorders. Furthermore  the trial will utilize the Lung clearance index and new  PCD-specific quality of life instruments as outcome measures for PCD. Recruitment is hampered by frequent occurrence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection  exacerbations at enrolment  and the patients' perception of disease severity and necessity of additional management and treatment during trial participation.

Outcome Assessment (Health Care),,,Acute extracranial occlusion of the internal carotid artery: emergent surgery remains a viable option. Acute symptomatic occlusion of extracranial internal carotid artery (eICA) can lead to a critical and potentially devastating stroke associated with high morbidity and mortality. Optimal treatment remains unclear. We analyzed our institutional experience with emergent surgical recanalization of acutely occluded eICA. Retrospective analysis of hospital records  surgical reports  imaging studies and outpatient records. Final outcome was assessed according to modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Between January 2010 and September 2013  22 patients underwent emergent surgical recanalization. There were 17 men and five women  mean age 65.4 years (range 37-85). Mean admission National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was 12 (range 6-21). All patients had evidence of salvageable penumbra on perfusion computed tomography. Tandem intracranial lesion was present in nine patients. Surgical recanalization was successful in 16 patients (72.7 %). Twenty-four hours after surgery  17 patients (77.2 %) improved by a minimum of 1 point on NIHSS  14 patients (63.6 %) improved by three and more points; two patients deteriorated by two and five points  the latter treated initially with systemic thrombolysis due to intracranial hemorrhage. No other intracranial hematoma was observed. During 30 days following surgery  two patients died (9 % mortality rate) due to severity of initial stroke. On discharge  four patients were classified as mRS 0  five patients as mRS 1  five patients as mRS 2 and six patients as mRS 4. Favorable recovery (mRS 0-2) was achieved in 14 patients (63.6 %). No change in mRS was observed at three months. Our results suggest that emergent surgical desobliteration of occluded eICA can lead to favorable recovery in a majority of patients. Patient selection based on penumbra imaging is crucial. Given the popularity and simplicity of carotid endarterectomy  the procedure should by no means be abandoned in the treatment of acute eICA occlusion.
Family Practice,Patient Education as Topic,,A cluster randomized trial in general practice with referral to a group-based or an Internet-based smoking cessation programme. Reviews state that there is a room for improvements of smoking cessation (SC) intervention in general practice. In 2005  all 61 general practitioners (GPs) in four municipalities in Copenhagen  Denmark  were invited to participate. Twenty-four GPs accepted and were cluster randomized to one of three groups: Group A  referral to group-based SC counselling (national model)  n = 10; Group B  referral to internet-based SC programme (newly developed)  n = 8; or Group C  no referral ('do as usual')  n = 6. A total of 1518/1914 smokers were included  and 760 returned a questionnaire at 1-year follow-up. The participating GPs reported significantly more SC counselling than GPs who refused participation (P = 0.04). Self-reported point abstinence was 6.7% (40/600)  5.9% (28/476) and 5.7% (25/442) in Groups A  B and C  respectively. Only 40 smokers attended group-based SC counselling  and 75 logged in at the internet-based SC programme. In cluster analyses  we found no significant additional effect of referral to group-based (OR: 1.05; 95% CI: 0.6-1.8) or internet-based SC programmes (OR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.6-1.4). We found no additional effect on cessation rates of GPs' referring to group-based SC counselling or internet-based SC programme. This finding might  to some degree  be explained by the short time used by the GPs on SC counselling and the selection of the participating doctors.
Genetic Counseling,,,Molecular biology from bench-to-bedside - which colorectal cancer patients should be referred for genetic counselling and risk assessment. Lynch syndrome is associated with deficiency of the mismatch repair genes MLH1  MSH2  MSH6 or PMS2. However  most MLH1 deficient tumours are sporadic in origin  and they can be identified if harbouring a BRAF V600E mutation or hypermethylation of the MLH1 gene promoter. The aim of this study was to validate our previously suggested clinically applicable strategy based on molecular characteristics for identifying which patients to refer for genetic counselling. The strategy was validated in an unselected cohort of 287 colorectal cancer patients. All tumours were tested for MLH1  PMS2  MSH2 and MSH6 protein expression with immunohistochemistry. DNA from MLH1 negative tumours was sequenced for BRAF mutations. If BRAF was wild-type  MLH1 promoter was subsequently analyzed for promoter hypermethylation. Most tumours  251 (88%)  stained positive for all four proteins. Six (2%) had negative MSH2 and one (<1%) isolated loss of MSH6. MLH1 and PMS2 were negative in 29 cases (10%). DNA quality allowed BRAF analysis in 27 of these with 14 mutations and 13 wild-type. DNA quality allowed methylation analysis in 11 of the 13 BRAF wild-type  and all but one were methylated. Subsequently  Lynch syndrome could not be ruled out in 12 patients. A follow-up at 8-10 years revealed four definite cases of Lynch syndrome and three highly suspicious. An easy and clinically applicable step-wise approach with immunohistochemistry (100%)  BRAF sequencing (10%) and methylation analysis (5%) identified several patients with hereditary cancer. It is feasible to perform a molecular screening to select patients for genetic counselling.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Human Papillomavirus Infection and p16 Expression in Extragenital/Extraungual Bowen Disease in Immunocompromised Patients. An increased rate of second nonmelanoma skin cancers is found in immunocompromised patients. Epidemiological and molecular data implicate ultraviolet radiation as the major risk factor. In addition  there is increasing evidence supporting the role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in the pathogenesis of premalignant and malignant skin lesions in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. In a retrospective cross-sectional study  the authors examined the expression of p16 by immunohistochemistry and the presence of mucosal (α-genus) and cutaneous/epidermodysplasia verruciformis (β-genus) HPV DNA by polymerase chain reaction in 29 biopsy specimens of extragenital/extraungual Bowen disease (BD) from 24 Eastern European white immunocompromised patients. Furthermore  the author evaluated the association between the expression of p16 protein and the presence of HPV DNA. Among 25 specimens from 21 patients evaluable by polymerase chain reaction  HPV DNA was detected in 10 (40%) BD lesions from 9 patients. Beta-HPV predominated over alpha-HPV types. Among 29 immunohistochemically evaluable BD specimens  22 lesions (∼76%) from 20 patients were scored as p16 positive. HPV DNA-positive and HPV DNA-negative lesions displayed the same proportion of p16 positivity (80%) and no correlation was found between the HPV DNA presence and the p16 expression status. Our pilot study demonstrated that β-HPV infections predominate in BD cases diagnosed among immunocompromised patients  although high- and low-risk mucosal (alpha) HPV genotypes may be detected in a minority of cases. In contrast to anogenital HPV-associated lesions  positive p16 expression is not a reliable marker of high-risk α-HPV infection in BD cases  as it can be also detected in β-HPV infected and HPV-negative cases.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Syringocystadenocarcinoma Papilliferum In Situ-Like Changes in Extramammary Paget Disease: A Report of 11 Cases. The authors report 11 cases of extramammary Paget disease (EMPD)  all of which also demonstrated a combination of histological changes highly reminiscent of syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum in situ. In addition to the classical features of EMPD  characterized by the intraepidermal spread of individually dispersed neoplastic cells with ample cytoplasm  many of which contained mucin  there were areas of acanthosis with the substitution of spinous layer keratinocytes by neoplastic cells  whereas the native basal cell layer was intact. In addition to acanthosis (and sometimes papillomatosis)  the dermal papillae showed a prominent infiltrate of plasma cells  completing the resemblance to syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum in situ; this similarity was further enhanced in 2 cases  which showed conspicuous gland formation. One additional case showed multifocal dermal proliferations compatible with eccrine syringofibroadenoma (syringofibroadenomatous hyperplasia). The changes described herein seem to be relatively rare in EMPD  and they can represent a diagnostic pitfall  as evidenced by 2 cases that were originally misinterpreted as syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum in situ. Clinically  these microscopic changes sometimes corresponded to nodular lesions  which were specifically noted to have a papillated erosive surface.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Hybrid Epithelioid Schwannoma/Perineurioma. We report a case of a 58-year-old who woman presented with a solitary slowly growing subcutaneous nodule covered by normally appearing skin on her left groin. Microscopically  the lesion was well circumscribed but unencapsulated  and showed biphasic cellular differentiation. One cell population was presented by small rounded (epithelioid) cells arranged singly  in small aggregates or short cords  whereas the second one was composed of cells with slender nuclei and delicate elongated bipolar cytoplasmic processes. On immunohistochemistry  the epithelioid component showed positive reaction for S-100 protein and negative for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA)  thus compatible with schwannian differentiation and resembling epithelioid schwannoma. The other component showed a reverse immunophenotype being S-100 protein negative and EMA positive  thus corresponding to perineuriomatous differentiation. The clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical features of the lesion were compatible with hybrid epithelioid schwannoma/perineurioma  a rare morphological variant of peripheral nerve sheath tumors.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Aggressive Extraocular Sebaceous Carcinoma of the Scalp Involving the Brain in a Patient With Muir-Torre Syndrome. This article reports an unusual case of aggressive extraocular sebaceous carcinoma located on the scalp with subsequent usurpation of the bone and penetrating through the bone and meninges to the brain in a 56-year-old man affected by Muir-Torre syndrome. Microscopically  the sebaceous neoplasm was located in the middle to deep dermis without any connection to the epidermis and showed a multinodular growth with neoplastic nodules with a central comedo-type necrosis separated from each other by fibrovascular stroma. The nodules were composed of varying proportions of mature sebaceous cells and atypical basaloid cells with high degree of atypia  including high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio  nuclear pleomorphism  macronucleoli  atypical mitoses  and necrosis. The neoplasm was totally removed. Histopathological examinations of the recurrent lesion showed identical morphological features and  in addition  signs of the tumors growing through the periosteum were noted. In the final excision specimen  both the dura mater and the brain tissue were infiltrated by the sebaceous carcinoma. The diagnosis of Muir-Torre syndrome was confirmed by molecular genetic investigation that revealed an identical germline mutation in MSH2 gene in several family members  some of whom had colorectal tumors.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Desmoplastic melanoma: an updated immunohistochemical analysis of 40 cases with a proposal for an additional panel of stains for diagnosis. Desmoplastic melanoma (DM) is histologically characterized by a proliferation of spindle melanocytes dispersed in a collagenous stroma that can be mistaken for a variety of neoplasms. The purpose of this study was to analyze 40 cases of DM with a comprehensive panel of immunohistochemical markers (KBA.62  p16  Ezrin  WT-1  MITF-1  SOX-10  CD117  SOX-2  nestin  PNL2  p75  MART-1  gp100 and S100p) to obtain a more complete understanding of the potential use of these antibodies in the diagnosis of DM. We found that all cases of DM expressed p16  WT-1  SOX-10  nestin and S100p and 95% of cases expressed p75. There was variable expression with Ezrin  SOX-2  KBA.62  MART-1 and HMB-45. Most DMs did not express MITF-1  PNL2 and CD117. Conditions that may enter in the histologic differential diagnosis of DM  including dermal scars  fibromatosis and dermatofibromas were also studied. Nearly all control cases also stained positive for p16 but were negative for WT1  SOX10  nestin  p75 and S-100p  as well as for most of the other markers tested. We conclude that a panel of S-100p  WT1  SOX10  p75 and nestin may constitute the optimal panel with the most sensitive and specific combination of immunostain available for the diagnosis of DM.
Anesthesiology,,,Anaesthetist-provided pre-hospital advanced airway management in children: a descriptive study. Pre-hospital advanced airway management has been named one of the top-five research priorities in physician-provided pre-hospital critical care. Few studies have been made on paediatric pre-hospital advanced airway management. The aim of this study was to investigate pre-hospital endotracheal intubation success rate in children  first-pass success rates and complications related to pre-hospital advanced airway management in patients younger than 16 years of age treated by pre-hospital critical care teams in the Central Denmark Region (1.3 million inhabitants). A prospective descriptive study based on data collected from eight anaesthetist-staffed pre-hospital critical care teams between February 1st 2011 and November 1st 2012. Primary endpoints were 1) pre-hospital endotracheal intubation success rate in children 2) pre-hospital endotracheal intubation first-pass success rate in children and 3) complications related to prehospital advanced airway management in children. The pre-hospital critical care anaesthetists attempted endotracheal intubation in 25 children  13 of which were less than 2 years old. In one patient  a neonate (600 g birth weight)  endotracheal intubation failed. The patient was managed by uneventful bag-mask ventilation. All other 24 children had their tracheas successfully intubated by the pre-hospital critical care anaesthetists resulting in a pre-hospital endotracheal intubation success rate of 96 %. Overall first pass success-rate was 75 %. In the group of patients younger than 2 years old  first pass success-rate was 54 %. The total rate of airway management related complications such as vomiting  aspiration  accidental intubation of the oesophagus or right main stem bronchus  hypoxia (oxygen saturation < 90 %) or bradycardia (according to age) was 20 % in children younger than 16 years of age and 38 % in children younger than 2 years of age. No deaths  cardiac arrests or severe bradycardia (heart rate <60) occurred in relation to pre-hospital advanced airway management. Compared with the total population of patients receiving pre-hospital advanced airway management in our system  the overall success rate following pre-hospital endotracheal intubations in children is acceptable but the first-pass success rate is low. The complication rates in the paediatric population are higher than in our pre-hospital advanced airway management patient population as a whole. This illustrates that young children may represent a substantial pre-hospital airway management challenge even for experienced pre-hospital critical care anaesthetists. This may influence future training and quality insurance initiatives in paediatric pre-hospital advanced airway management.
Epidemiology,Neonatology,,Morbidity and mortality in preterm neonates with patent ductus arteriosus on day 3. To assess the association between a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) on day 3 of life and severe morbidity and mortality. Cohort study. Neonatal Intensive Care Unit  Aarhus University Hospital  Denmark. All neonates with a gestational age less than 32 weeks admitted from 2010 to 2012. All neonates (n=183) were routinely screened with echocardiography for PDA on day 3 of life. Information on baseline characteristics and outcome was collected by structured coding sheets and medical records. The association among PDA diameter and pulmonary haemorrhage  intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH)  necrotising enterocolitis  bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)  death  and the composite outcome of death or severe morbidity was assessed. In neonates  born prior to 28 gestational weeks  a PDA on day 3 of life was associated with a threefold increase in odds of death or severe morbidity compared with neonates without PDA (OR=3.4; CI 1.1 to 11). The odds were highest in neonates with a large PDA (diameter ≥1.5 mm). Neonates with a large PDA were also found to have increased odds of IVH (OR 4.2; CI 1.3 to 14) and BPD (OR 3.7; CI 1.0 to 14) compared with neonates with no PDA. In neonates born with a gestational age below 28 weeks the presence of a PDA on day 3 of life was associated with adverse outcome; this association was even more pronounced with a large PDA. Thus  early echocardiography may facilitate the identification of neonates suitable for a targeted approach to intervention in future randomised controlled trials.
Rehabilitation,,,Distribution-based estimates of minimum clinically important difference in cognition  arm function and lower body function after slow release-fampridine treatment of patients with multiple sclerosis. To provide distribution-based estimates of the minimal clinical important difference (MCID) after slow release fampridine treatment on cognition and functional capacity in people with MS (PwMS). MCID values were determined after SR-Fampridine treatment in 105 PwMS. Testing included the Timed 25 Foot Walk (T25FW)  the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT)  the Six Spot Step Test (SSST)  the 9-Hole-Peg-Test (9-HPT)  and the 5-Time-Sit-To-Stand test (5-STS). MCID values: T25FW 17.8% (9.1-17.8)  SDMT 17.1% (9.2-17.1)  SSST 16.7% (8.5-16.7)  9-HPT 15.3% (0-15.3)  and 5-STS 34.6% (16.9-34.6). This study presents distribution-based estimates of MCID values for the SSST  the 9-HPT  and the 5-STS and confirms MCID estimates for the T25FW and the SDMT.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Aminopyridines for symptomatic treatment of multiple sclerosis]. 3 4-diaminopyridine (DAP) and 4-aminopyridine (AP) block potassium channels and can improve action potentials in demyelinated nerve fibres. We identified ten randomised placebo-controlled trials investigating AP/DAP as symptomatic treatment in multiple sclerosis. There is evidence that AP and DAP improve muscle strength in the lower extremities and that AP increases walking speed  and it might improve Expanded Disability Status Scale scores  spasticity and fatigue. There is a lack of evidence-based guidelines of treatment and studies investigating the effect on participation/activity and quality of life.
Outcome Assessment (Health Care),,,[Is "quality of life" a relevant goal in clinical studies of rehabilitation?]. By consensus and in accordance with the WHO  the relevant outcomes of rehabilitation are "function" and "social participation". Nevertheless  most physicians will agree that improved Quality of Life (QoL) is the ultimate goal of medicine. Although many well-validated health-related QoL instruments are available  these are generally flawed due to considerable redundancy and lack of consistent responsiveness. Further efforts are required in order to engineer instruments that are in accordance with the WHO-ICF concept  which will make studies of the interaction between "symptoms"  "activity"  "social participation" and QoL meaningful.
Sanitation,,,Locally produced natural conditioners for dewatering of faecal sludge. In urban areas of low-income countries  treatment of faecal sludge (FS) is insufficient or non-existent. This results in large amounts of FS being dumped into the environment. Existing treatment technologies for FS  such as settling-thickening tanks and drying beds  are land intensive which is limiting in urban areas. Enhanced settling and dewatering by conditioning was evaluated in order to reduce the treatment footprint (or increase treatment capacity). Conventional wastewater conditioners  such as commercially available lime and polymers  are expensive  and commonly rely on complex supply chains for use in low-income countries. Therefore  the treatment performance of five conditioners which could be produced locally was evaluated: Moringa oleifera seeds and press cake  Jatropha curcas seeds  Jatropha Calotropis leaves and chitosan. M. oleifera seeds and press cake  and chitosan improved settling and dewatering and had a similar performance compared to lime and polymers. Optimal dosages were 400-500 kg M. oleifera/t TS  300-800 kg lime/t TS and 25-50 kg polymer solution/t TS. In comparison  chitosan required 1.5-3.75 kg/t TS. These dosages are comparable to those recommended for wastewater (sludge). The results indicate that conditioning of FS can reduce total suspended solids (TSS) in the effluent of settling-thickening tanks by 22-81% and reduce dewatering time with drying beds by 59-97%. This means that the area of drying beds could be reduced by 59-97% with end-use as soil conditioner  or 9-26% as solid fuel. Least expensive options and availability will depend on the local context. In Dakar  Senegal  chitosan produced from shrimp waste appears to be most promising.
Proteomics,,,Combining patient proteomics and in vitro cardiomyocyte phenotype testing to identify potential mediators of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Heart failure with ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a syndrome resulting from several co-morbidities in which specific mediators are unknown. The platelet proteome responds to disease processes. We hypothesize that the platelet proteome will change composition in patients with HFpEF and may uncover mediators of the syndrome. Proteomic changes were assessed in platelets from hospitalized subjects with symptoms of HFpEF (n = 9)  the same subjects several weeks later without symptoms (n = 7) and control subjects (n = 8). Mass spectrometry identified 6102 proteins with five scans with peptide probabilities of ≥0.85. Of the 6102 proteins  165 were present only in symptomatic subjects  78 were only found in outpatient subjects and 157 proteins were unique to the control group. The S100A8 protein was identified consistently in HFpEF samples when compared with controls. We validated the fining that plasma S100A8 levels are increased in subjects with HFpEF (654 ± 391) compared to controls (352 ± 204) in an external cohort (p = 0.002). Recombinant S100A8 had direct effects on the electrophysiological and calcium handling profile in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. Platelets may harbor proteins associated with HFpEF. S100A8 is present in the platelets of subjects with HFpEF and increased in the plasma of the same subjects. We further established a bedside-to-bench translational system that can be utilized as a secondary screen to ascertain whether the biomarkers may be an associated finding or causal to the disease process. S100A8 has been linked with other cardiovascular disease such as atherosclerosis and risk for myocardial infarction  stroke  or death. This is the first report on association of S100A8 with HFpEF.
Hematology,Pediatrics,,Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Adolescents and Young Adults Treated in Pediatric and Adult Departments in the Nordic Countries. Studies on adolescents and young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia suggest better results when using pediatric protocols for adult patients  while corresponding data for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are limited. We investigated disease characteristics and outcome for de novo AML patients 10-30 years old treated in pediatric or adult departments. We included 166 patients 10-18 years of age with AML treated according to the pediatric NOPHO-protocols (1993-2009) compared with 253 patients aged 15-30 years treated in hematology departments (1996-2009) in the Nordic countries. The incidence of AML was 4.9/million/year for the age group 10-14 years  6.5 for 15-18 years  and 6.9 for 19-30 years. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) was more frequent in adults and in females of all ages. Pediatric patients with APL had similar overall survival as pediatric patients without APL. Overall survival at 5 years was 60% (52-68%) for pediatric patients compared to 65% (58-70%) for adult patients. Cytogenetics and presenting white blood cell count were the only independent prognostic factors for overall survival. Age was not an independent prognostic factor. No difference was found in outcome for AML patients age 10-30 years treated according to pediatric as compared to adult protocols.
Serology,,,Elimination of interfering activity in serum samples in the Chinese hamster ovary pertussis serology assay. An interfering substance in various frozen serum samples was observed to inhibit the adhesion of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells to microplate surfaces during a CHO pertussis neutralization test  resulting in wells that lacked cells or wells with dead cells after 2 days of incubation. The interfering activity in the serum could be eliminated by (i) transferring cells to other wells after their initial incubation  (ii) adding fetal calf serum (FCS) to the sample dilution buffer  (iii) precoating microplates with FCS  or (iv) preincubating the samples at 4 degrees C for 5 days. Preincubating the samples at 4 degrees C for 5 days reduced the interfering activity in only some of the samples. Adding serum to the sample dilution buffer or precoating the microplates with serum did not influence the antibody titers in the serum samples. The method described may be used for routine applications.
Metabolomics,,,Serum metabolites predict response to angiotensin II receptor blockers in patients with diabetes mellitus. Individual patients show a large variability in albuminuria response to angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). Identifying novel biomarkers that predict ARB response may help tailor therapy. We aimed to discover and validate a serum metabolite classifier that predicts albuminuria response to ARBs in patients with diabetes mellitus and micro- or macroalbuminuria. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry metabolomics was performed on serum samples. Data from patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria (n = 49) treated with irbesartan 300 mg/day were used for discovery. LASSO and ridge regression were performed to develop the classifier. Improvement in albuminuria response prediction was assessed by calculating differences in R(2) between a reference model of clinical parameters and a model with clinical parameters and the classifier. The classifier was externally validated in patients with type 1 diabetes and macroalbuminuria (n = 50) treated with losartan 100 mg/day. Molecular process analysis was performed to link metabolites to molecular mechanisms contributing to ARB response. In discovery  median change in urinary albumin excretion (UAE) was -42 % [Q1-Q3: -69 to -8]. The classifier  consisting of 21 metabolites  was significantly associated with UAE response to irbesartan (p < 0.001) and improved prediction of UAE response on top of the clinical reference model (R(2) increase from 0.10 to 0.70; p < 0.001). In external validation  median change in UAE was -43 % [Q1-Q35: -63 to -23]. The classifier improved prediction of UAE response to losartan (R(2) increase from 0.20 to 0.59; p < 0.001). Specifically ADMA impacting eNOS activity appears to be a relevant factor in ARB response. A serum metabolite classifier was discovered and externally validated to significantly improve prediction of albuminuria response to ARBs in diabetes mellitus.
Environmental Microbiology,,,Mechanism of injury and microbiological flora of the geographical location are essential for the prognosis in soldiers with serious warfare injuries. Denmark has been engaged in the Afghanistan war and as a result  Rigshospitalet has received a number of multi-traumatized Danish soldiers. Lesions sustained in armed conflict differ from their civilian counterparts and knowledge of the pathophysiology related to these types of lesions is essential when engaging in the intensive care of these patients. The study was conducted as a retrospective survey of Danish soldiers evacuated from Afghanistan to the Intensive Care Unit at Rigshospitalet in the 2002-2012 period. The following data were recorded: age  gender  hospitalization (days)  mortality  organ involvement  respiratory therapy  dialysis  circulatory supportive care  antibiotic treatment and bacteriology. Furthermore  Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation  Simplified Acute Physiology Score and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores were calculated. A total of twenty patients were identified and included in the study. All patients had sustained serious blast injuries as a result of explosion. Primarily the central nervous system  respiratory  musculoskeletal and abdominal systems were affected by the explosions. Eighteen patients survived to discharge and two patients died. Explosion was the most frequent cause of injury in all cases and caused damage to several organ systems. Infections after combat injuries are a major problem because of the different microbiological profile. The use of explosives has been and remains a substantial part of warfare  and this review has showed us that the knowledge of the mechanism of injury is indeed essential  and that intelligence on the microbiological flora of the geographical location of the conflict is essential. not relevant. not relevant.
Neurology,,,Progressive disgregation of brain networking from normal aging to Alzheimer's Disease. Independent Component Analysis on FDG-PET data. Brain connectivity has been assessed in several neurodegenerative disorders investigating the mutual correlations between pre-determined regions or nodes. The selective breakdown of brain networks during the progression from the normal aging (NA) to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) has also been observed. We implemented Independent Component Analysis (ICA) on 18F-FDG-PET data in five groups of subjects with cognitive state ranging from NA to AD dementia  including mild cognitive impairment patients not converting (ncMCI) and converting (MCI) to mild AD dementia  in order to disclose the spatial distribution of the independent components (ICs) in each cognitive state  and their accuracy in discriminating the groups. We could identify spatially distinct ICs in each group with an increasing generation of new local circuits proportional to the severity of the disease. AD-specific ICs appeared from the late MCI stage and could discriminate MCI and AD dementia from ncMCI with an accuracy of 83.5%. There was a progressive disgregation of the intrinsic networks from NA to MCI and AD dementia  in an inversely proportional fashion to conversion time. Functional brain connectivity on FDG-PET has been shown by ICA to be gradually disrupted across progressive states of cognitive severity in AD  which might be implemented at individual level  especially for prognostic purposes  and as a surrogate biomarker in intervention trials.
Epidemiology,,,Ejaculatory frequency and the risk of aggressive prostate cancer: Findings from a case-control study. Recent literature reports inverse associations with ejaculator frequency and prostate cancer (PC). We sought to explore the relationship between ejaculatory frequency from ages 20 to 50 and subsequent development of aggressive PC. We conducted a case-control study sampling 2 141 men from private urology practices in Victoria  Australia. Cases were defined as men with high grade or high stage PC and controls being biopsy negative men. Ejaculation frequency recalled at age decades 20  30  and 40 second was assessed by questionnaire. Unconditional multivariable logistic regression models were used to generate odds ratios (ORs). An inverse association with ejaculatory frequency at age 30 to 39 was observed (OR per 5-unit increase per week = 0.83  95% CI: 0.72-0.96) but not at ages 20 to 29 (OR = 1.01  95% CI: 0.89-1.14) or ages 40 to 49 (OR = 0.95  95% CI: 0.81-1.12). This result differed between men with new sexual partners after age 30 (OR = 0.77  P = 0.009) and those with no new partners (OR = 0.97  P = 0.8) though the test for a difference between these estimates was not significant (P = 0.11). We found only weak evidence of an inverse association between ejaculatory frequency in the fourth decade of life and advanced PC  which was not significantly modified by number of new sexual partners. No relationship was found for ejaculatory frequency in the third and fifth decades of life.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Neural tissue-spheres: a microexplant culture method for propagation of precursor cells from the rat forebrain subventricular zone. By combining new and established protocols we have developed a procedure for isolation and propagation of neural precursor cells from the forebrain subventricular zone (SVZ) of newborn rats. Small tissue blocks of the SVZ were dissected and propagated en bloc as free-floating neural tissue-spheres (NTS) in EGF and FGF2 containing medium. The spheres were cut into quarters when passaged every 10-15th day  avoiding mechanical or enzymatic dissociation in order to minimize cellular trauma and preserve intercellular contacts. For analysis of regional differences within the forebrain SVZ  NTS were derived from three rostro-caudal levels of the lateral ventricles (anterior  intermediate and posterior) and propagated separately. Explants from all three levels produced proliferating NTS  but "anterior" NTS in general grew to smaller sizes than "intermediate" and "posterior" NTS. Posterior NTS moreover maintained their neurogenic potential throughout 77 days of propagation  while the ability of anterior NTS to generate neurons severely declined from day 40. The present procedure describes isolation and long-term expansion of forebrain SVZ tissue with potential preservation of the endogenous cellular content  thus allowing experimental studies of neural precursor cells and their niche.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Expansion and characterization of ventral mesencephalic precursor cells: effect of mitogens and investigation of FA1 as a potential dopaminergic marker. Methods for identification and in vitro expansion of ventral mesencephalic dopaminergic precursor cells are of interest in the search for transplantable neurons for cell therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD). We investigated the potential use of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) for expansion of such dopaminergic precursor cells  and fetal antigen-1 (FA1)  a secreted neuronal protein of unknown function  as a non-invasive dopaminergic marker. Tissue from embryonic day (ED) 12 rat ventral mesencephalon was dissociated mechanically and cultured for 4 days in the presence of FGF2  FGF8  or without mitogens (control). After mitogen withdrawal and addition of 0.5% bovine serum  cells were differentiated for 6 days. Before differentiation  significantly more cells incorporated BrdU in cultures exposed to FGF2 (19-fold; P < 0.001) and FGF8 (3-fold; P < 0.05) compared to controls. After differentiation  biochemical analyses showed significantly more dopamine and FA1 in conditioned medium from both FGF2 and FGF8 expanded cultures than in controls. Correspondingly  numbers of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)- and FA1-immunoreactive cells had increased 16-fold (P < 0.001) and 2.1-fold (P < 0.001)  respectively in the FGF2 group and 10-fold (P < 0.001) and 1.8-fold (P < 0.05)  respectively in the FGF8 group. In conclusion  the present procedure allows efficient expansion and differentiation of dopaminergic precursor cells and provides novel evidence of FGF8 as a mitogen for these cells. Furthermore  FA1 was identified as a potential supplementary non-invasive marker of cultured dopaminergic neurons.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors reduce excitotoxic injury and may facilitate neurogenesis. Group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonist DHPG reduced nerve cell death caused by their exposure to NMDA ("neuroprotective effect") and attenuated NMDA receptor-mediated currents [Blaabjerg  M.  Baskys  A.  Zimmer  J.  Vawter  M. P.  2003b. Changes in hippocampal gene expression after neuroprotective activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors. Brain Research  Molecular Brain Research 117  196-205.]. In the present study  we used organotypic hippocampal culture preparation to examine specific phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U73122 effects on DHPG-induced neuroprotection  changes in excitatory synaptic transmission associated with the neuroprotective DHPG treatment and a role of group I mGluR ligands in neurogenesis. Results show that short (10 min) DHPG treatment did not result in neuroprotection but significantly depressed field synaptic potentials (fEPSP) in the Schaffer collateral-CA1 pathway. The fEPSP depression was not affected by the PLC inhibitor U73122. In contrast  prolonged (2-h) treatment of cultures with DHPG induced a significant protective effect that was blocked by a PLC inhibitor U73122 but not by its inactive analog U73343. Voltage-clamp measurements of spontaneous miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs) recorded in CA1 neurons from cultures treated with DHPG (10 microM  2 h) showed a significant reduction of the EPSC amplitude in DHPG-treated but not control (untreated) cultures. This reduction was completely abolished by U73122  suggesting a PLC involvement. Since activation of PLC is thought to be associated with cell proliferation  we investigated whether group I mGluR agonist DHPG or subtype antagonists LY367385 and MPEP have an effect on dentate granule cells expressing immature neuronal marker TOAD-64. DHPG (100 microM  72 h) slightly but not significantly increased the number of TOAD-64 positive cells. The mGluR1 antagonists LY367385 (10 microM  72 h) markedly decreased the number of TOAD-64 positive cells and mGluR5 antagonist MPEP (1 microM  72 h) had no effect. These data suggest that (1) prolonged activation of group I mGluRs reduces nerve cell susceptibility to excitotoxic injury in a PLC-dependent manner; (2) this reduction is associated with a PLC-dependent depression of excitatory synaptic transmission; and (3) mGluR1 activation may facilitate neurogenesis.
Histology,,,The association between histological  macroscopic and magnetic resonance imaging assessed synovitis in end-stage knee osteoarthritis: a cross-sectional study. To investigate the association between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  macroscopic and histological assessments of synovitis in end-stage knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Synovitis of end-stage osteoarthritic knees was assessed using non-contrast-enhanced (CE)  contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI prior to (TKR) and correlated with microscopic and macroscopic assessments of synovitis obtained intraoperatively. Multiple bivariate correlations were used with a pre-specified threshold of 0.70 for significance. Also  multiple regression analyses with different subsets of MRI-variables as explanatory variables and the histology score as outcome variable were performed with the intention to find MRI-variables that best explain the variance in histological synovitis (i.e.  highest R(2)). A stepped approach was taken starting with basic characteristics and non-CE MRI-variables (model 1)  after which CE-MRI-variables were added (model 2) with the final model also including DCE-MRI-variables (model 3). 39 patients (56.4% women  mean age 68 years  Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade 4) had complete MRI and histological data. Only the DCE-MRI variable MExNvoxel (surrogate of the volume and degree of synovitis) and the macroscopic score showed correlations above the pre-specified threshold for acceptance with histological inflammation. The maximum R(2)-value obtained in Model 1 was R(2) = 0.39. In Model 2  where the CE-MRI-variables were added  the highest R(2) = 0.52. In Model 3  a four-variable model consisting of the gender  one CE-MRI and two DCE-MRI-variables yielded a R(2) = 0.71. DCE-MRI is correlated with histological synovitis in end-stage KOA and the combination of CE and DCE-MRI may be a useful  non-invasive tool in characterising synovitis in KOA.
Mathematics,,,Early childhood otitis media and later school performance - A prospective cohort study of associations. Otitis media (OM) is a common disease in childhood and hearing loss (HL) is the most common complication. Prolonged HL may lead to language delay and cognitive difficulties. However  the consequences of HL due to OM are not fully understood. The aim of this study was to determine the possible association between number of OM episodes in childhood and self-rated school performance controlling for potential confounders. Prospectively gathered systematic interview data on OM episodes in early childhood and school performance at 11 years of age were obtained from The Danish National Birth Cohort  involving >100 000 individual pregnancies and their offspring. We defined four exposure groups (0  1-3  4-6 and ≥7 OM episodes) and assessed general school performance  mathematics and literacy. Possible confounders were recognized à priori and associations were determined using proportional odds regression. Out of 94 745 successful pregnancies  35 946 children without malformations and their parents completed a questionnaire at age 11 years. No associations were observed between number of OM episodes and school performance  even in children with ≥7 OM episodes. This national birth-cohort study did not support the hypothesis that the number of OM episodes in childhood is associated with reduced self-reported school performance in children at 11 years of age.
Epidemiology,,,Host immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis and risk of tuberculosis: A longitudinal study among Greenlanders. Human immune responses to latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection (LTBI) may enable individuals to control Mtb infection and halt progression to tuberculosis (TB)  a hypothesis applied in several novel TB vaccines. We aimed to evaluate whether immune responses to selected LTBI antigens were associated with subsequent reduced risk of progression to TB. We conducted a population-based cohort study in East Greenland (2012-2014) including individuals aged 5-31years. A personal identifier allowed follow-up in national registers including the TB notification register. Mtb infection was defined by a positive Quantiferon test. Immune responses to LTBI antigens were assessed by whole blood antigen stimulation and interferon gamma measurement. Among 978 participants  67 previously had TB. LTBI antigen (Rv1284  Rv2659  Rv2660c) immune response prevalence was 18%  50%  2% among Mtb-infected and 7%  40%  4% among non-infected (Quantiferon negative) participants. Among 911 participants without prior notified TB  31 were notified with TB during study follow-up. Immune responses to LTBI antigens were not associated with reduced risk of subsequent TB; Rv1284 HR 0.92 (95%CI 0.28-3.04)  Rv2659 HR 1.05 (95%CI 0.51-2.13)  Rv2660c HR 3.06 (95%CI 0.70-13.37). In this large population-based study  human immune responses to selected LTBI antigens were not found to be strongly associated with reduced risk of subsequent TB.
Genetics  Population,,,Determination of NAT2 acetylation status in the Greenlandic population. N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) is a well-studied phase II xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme relevant in drug metabolism and cancerogenesis. NAT2 activity is largely determined by genetic polymorphisms in the coding region of the corresponding gene. We investigated NAT2 acetylation status in 1556 individuals from Greenland based on four different single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panels and the tagging SNP rs1495741. There was good concordance between the NAT2 status inferred by the different SNP combinations. Overall  the fraction of slow acetylators was low with 17.5 % and varied depending on the degree of Inuit ancestry; in individuals with <50 % Inuit ancestry  we observed more than 25 % slow acetylators reflecting European ancestry. Greenland has a high incidence of tuberculosis  and individual dosing of isoniazid according to NAT2 status has been shown to improve treatment and reduce side effects. Our findings could be a first step in pharmacogenetics-based tuberculosis therapy in Greenland.
Microscopy,,,Vaginal microbiome in women from Greenland assessed by microscopy and quantitative PCR. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common condition  although its aetiology remains unexplained. The aim of this study was to analyse the composition of vaginal microbiota in women from Greenland to provide a quantitative description and improve the understanding of BV. Self-collected vaginal smears and swabs were obtained from 177 women. The vaginal smears were graded for BV according to Nugent's criteria. The vaginal swab samples were analysed by 19 quantitative PCRs (qPCRs) for selected vaginal bacteria and by PCR for four sexually transmitted infections (STIs). STIs were common: Mycoplasma genitalium 12%  Chlamydia trachomatis 7%  Neisseria gonorrhoeae 1%  and Trichomonas vaginalis 0.5%. BV was found in 45% of women  but was not associated with individual STIs. Seven of the 19 vaginal bacteria (Atopobium vaginae  Prevotella spp.  Gardnerella vaginalis  BVAB2  Eggerthella-like bacterium  Leptotrichia amnionii  and Megasphaera type 1) had areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve > 85%  suggesting they are good predictors of BV according to Nugent. Prevotella spp. had the highest odds ratio for BV (OR 437; 95% CI 82-2779) in univariate analysis considering only specimens with a bacterial load above the threshold determined by ROC curve analysis as positive  as well as the highest adjusted odds ratio in multivariate logistic regression analysis (OR 4.4; 95% CI 1.4-13.5). BV could be subdivided into clusters dominated by a single or a few species together. BV by Nugent score was highly prevalent. Two of seven key species (Prevotella spp. and A. vaginae) remained significantly associated with BV in a multivariate model after adjusting for other bacterial species. G. vaginalis and Prevotella spp. defined the majority of BV clusters.
Epidemiology,,,The risk of hearing loss in a population with a high prevalence of chronic suppurative otitis media. Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) affects 65-330 million people in the developing part of the world and develops in early childhood. Knowledge of the long-term effects on hearing is scarce. Hearing loss (HL) can cause reduced ability to communicate  impair language development and academic skills. To estimate the prevalence of HL in a population with a high-risk of CSOM and to identify the risk of permanent hearing loss from CSOM. Ten and 15 years follow-up of two Greenlandic population-based children cohorts. Participants underwent otologic examination and audiometric evaluation. HL was defined using both the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association's (ASHA) and the World Health Organizations's (WHO) definition. Risk factors for HL were analyzed  using binomial logistic regression analysis. A total of 438 individuals aged 11-24 years participated. Using the ASHA definition of HL the prevalence was 50% (95% CI 45.3-54.7). Using the WHO definition of HL the prevalence was 2.5% (95% CI 1.1-3.98). CSOM was the main cause of HL. Co-existing CSOM (OR 16.7  95% CI 8.29-33.65)  spontaneous healing from CSOM (OR 3.75  95% CI 1.62-8.67)  and male gender (OR 2.2  95% CI 1.28-3.78) were associated with HL. Ninety-one percent of children with CSOM developed a permanent hearing loss >15dBHL. CSOM was strongly associated with permanent hearing loss. CSOM was the main reason for HL in this population. The WHO definition of hearing loss is likely to underestimate the burden of hearing loss among children and adolescents in developing countries with a high prevalence of CSOM.
Research Design,,,A complex behavioural change intervention to reduce the risk of diabetes and prediabetes in the pre-conception period in Malaysia: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial. Over the past two decades  the population of Malaysia has grown rapidly and the prevalence of diabetes mellitus in Malaysia has dramatically increased  along with the frequency of obesity  hyperlipidaemia and hypertension. Early-life influences play an important role in the development of non-communicable diseases. Indeed  maternal lifestyle and conditions such as gestational diabetes mellitus or obesity can affect the risk of diabetes in the next generation. Lifestyle changes can help to prevent the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. This is a protocol for an unblinded  community-based  randomised controlled trial in two arms to evaluate the efficacy of a complex behavioural change intervention  combining motivational interviewing provided by a community health promoter and access to a habit formation mobile application  among young Malaysian women and their spouses prior to pregnancy. Eligible subjects will be Malaysian women in the age group 20 to 39 years  who are nulliparous  not diagnosed with diabetes and own a smartphone. With an alpha-value of 0.05  a statistical power of 90 %  264 subjects will need to complete the study. Subjects with their spouses will be randomised to either the intervention or the control arm for an 8-month period. The primary endpoint is change in waist circumference from baseline to end of intervention period and secondary endpoints are changes in anthropometric parameters  biochemical parameters  change in health literacy level  dietary habits  physical activity and stress level. Primary endpoint and the continuous secondary endpoints will be analysed in a linear regression model  whereas secondary endpoints on an ordinal scale will be analysed by using the chi-squared test. A multivariate linear model for the primary endpoint will be undertaken to account for potential confounders. This study has been approved by the Medical Research and Ethics Committee of the Ministry of Health Malaysia (protocol number: NMRR-14-904-21963) on 21 September 2015. This study protocol describes the first community-based randomised controlled trial  to examine the efficacy of a complex intervention in improving the pre-pregnancy health of young Malaysian women and their spouses. Results from this trial will contribute to improve policy and practices regarding complex behavioural change interventions to prevent diabetes in the pre-conception period in Malaysia and other low- and middle-income country settings. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) on 30 November 2015  Identifier: NCT02617693 .
Clinical Competence,General Practice,Health Services Research,Action research led to a feasible lifestyle intervention in general practice for people with prediabetes. To develop and pilot a feasible lifestyle intervention for people with prediabetes tailored for general practice. The study was designed to explore (i) what resources and competencies would be required and (ii) which intervention components should be included. In the first of two action research cycles various interventions were explored in general practice. The second cycle tested the intervention described by the end of the first cycle. In total  64 patients  8 GPs and 10 nurses participated. An intervention comprising six consultations to be delivered during the first year after identified prediabetes was found feasible by the general practice staff in terms of resources. Practice nurses possessed the adequate competences to undertake the core part of the intervention. The intervention comprised fixed elements according to structure  time consumption and educational principles  and flexible elements according to educational material and focus points for behaviour change. Clinical relevant reductions in patients' BMI and HbA1c were found. A prediabetes lifestyle intervention for Danish general practice with potential for diabetes prevention was developed based on action research. The transferability of the developed intervention to other general practices depends on the GPs priorities  availability of practice nurses to deliver the core part  and the remuneration system for general practice. The long-term feasibility in larger patient populations is unknown.
Public Health,,,Population movement: a key factor in the epidemiology of neglected tropical diseases. This review provides an overview of the complex ways in which population movements are linked to spread and control of neglected tropical diseases – often exacerbated by insufficient medical services and sanitary infrastructure. A new typology of population movements is suggested which builds on previous work but offers a more comprehensive typology based on the variables of 'onset'  'cause'  'direction' and 'motivation'. Schistosomiasis and leishmaniasis provide examples of the intricate ways in which population movements may play a role. A thorough and context-specific understanding of these patterns combined with the ability and will to launch targeted public health interventions is needed to achieve adequate control of neglected tropical diseases as well as other infectious diseases.
Environmental Health,Public Health,,A comprehensive approach to risk assessment and surveillance guiding public health interventions. Tools are required to identify 'multi-endemic' population segments - in order to benefit the most vulnerable people and to make public health interventions cost-effective. The article suggests a comprehensive risk assessment and surveillance system approach based on a combination of epidemiological  environmental and social determinants. Such a cross-disciplinary approach will combine the advantages of forecasting upcoming disease 'hot spots' with provision of evidence for long-term planning under more stable conditions  and it may in principle apply to any combination of public health problems depending on the local context.
Research Design,,,Benefit--a neglected aspect of health research ethics. In research ethics  provision of potential benefits to study participants is linked to the principles of beneficence and distributive justice. However  in most research ethical codes the notion of benefit is only superficially elaborated which is extended in vague and general benefit assessments in research proposals and in Research Ethical Committee's (REC) recommendations. The issue gains additional importance in collaborative projects where researchers  study populations and donors from both developing and developed countries are involved. We introduce a checklist for planning and assessment of benefits as part of research ethics and suggest as a first step in unfolding the concept of benefits that research project and RECs as a minimum should address who (the target groups)  when (the period of time during which the services are planned to be rendered) and what (the nature of the benefits).
Health Education,,,Local perceptions and practices in regard to opisthorchiasis in two villages in Lao PDR. The aim of the present study was to assess local perceptions and practices in regard to opisthorchiasis in a village receiving treatment and health education compared to a village where no intervention was offered. The study was conducted two years after a health education campaign had been carried out. Focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews were performed among 68 men and women. The results of the study show there were distinct differences in perceptions about opisthorchiasis when comparing the two villages. It appears that introducing health education alongside treatment does have an effect on knowledge and change in behavior. Eating raw fish was mainly practiced by men  however women were not aware they were exposed to opisthorchiasis while preparing food. Although there is no locally derived term  a medically appointed term for opisthorchiasis was acknowledged. Due to the vague disease symptoms  no treatment seeking behavior was found in relation to the disease. Further studies are needed to shed light on gender differences in regard to eating behavior and to assess infection risk among different Lao dishes containing freshwater fish.
Herbal Medicine,,,Traditional Bhutanese medicine (gSo-BA Rig-PA): an integrated part of the formal health care services. Traditional medicine in Bhutan is known as gSo-ba Rig-pa and is one of the oldest surviving medical traditions in the world. Other medical systems  such as Chinese medicine  Indian Ayurvedic medicine  Unani medicine  Greco-Roman medicine and the country's rich cultures and traditions have greatly influenced the way traditional Bhutanese medicine evolved. However  Buddhist philosophy remains the mainstream of this medical system. gSo-ba Rig-pa's principles are based on the perception the human body is composed of three main elements: rLung ('Air')  mKhris-pa ('Bile') and Bad-kan ('Phlegm'). When these three elements are balanced in the body a person is said to be healthy. The pathophysiology is also different from other medical systems  and the close link to Buddhism is reflected in the spiritual dimensions and the perception that all suffering is caused by ignorance. The treatment of diseases includes behavioral modification  physiotherapy  herbal medicines  minor surgery and spiritual healing. This makes the traditional Bhutanese medicine a unique and holistic health care system. The traditional medicine is an integrated and recognized part of the formal health care services in Bhutan under the auspices of the Ministry of Health. The article highlights three main points which can be learned from the Bhutanese experience: (1) the strong tradition of herbal medicines within gSo-ba Rig-pa forms a unique opportunity to prospect for new leads for development of pharmaceuticals  (2) the availability of the traditional medicine along with biomedicine broadens the health care choices for patients  and (3) the experiences of integrating two conceptually very different health care systems within one ministry contains important managerial lessons to be learned.
Biomedical Research,Research Design,,Research ethical challenges in cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural health research: the diversity of codes. The scope of health research has increased considerably during the last three to four decades  both geographically and regarding the range of disciplines participating in biomedical research. In other words cross-cultural and cross-disciplinary projects are much more common in the World's biomedical research of today. For the large part that involves human research subjects  ethics based on fundamental human values is still an integrated part of project planning and management. However  in the light of the increasing complexity of research  the controlling codes (i.e. laws  declarations  conventions and guidelines) have undergone important changes and have increased considerably in numbers. Hence  groups from different disciplines and cultures need to adjust their projects' research ethical policies and implementations in accordance with the various codes' common denominators. Sometimes research ethical codes are even incompatible at certain points. The article describes key ethical aspects of cross-cultural and cross-disciplinary projects  with special emphasis on acquiring consent  avoiding harm  attending to needs  and describing the obligations when a project is over. On this background the authors conclude that researchers in the planning phase of a project should: 1) seek knowledge and professional advice related to the transgression of cultural and disciplinary borders  2) introduce a long-term perspective for a project's activities and consequences  and 3) select the appropriate among the existing many ethical codes. These suggestions apply to several stakeholders: researchers  scientific societies  agencies for scientific support  information and ethical control  as well as research political agencies.
Qualitative Research,Schools,,"Retirement lost"-the new role of the elderly as caretakers for orphans in Western Kenya. A study on the new role of the elderly as caretakers of orphans was conducted in a rural part of Kenya applying a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. One out of three children had lost at least one biological parent and one of nine had lost both. These figures are increasing exponentially. Most orphans were cared for by relatives  and about one out of five caretakers was 55 years of age or above. These elderly caretakers faced major difficulties in caring for the orphans in terms of schooling  food and medical care. There is a major difference between the present hardships of these caretakers and the traditional position of the elderly in the past. This dramatic deterioration in the situation of the elderly should be seen in the context of the rampant HIV/AIDS epidemic  population growth  changing socio-cultural values  and unfavourable macroeconomic trends.
Anesthesiology,Clinical Competence,Curriculum,[Implementation of a national training assessment programme in anaesthesiology]. In 2004  outcome-based education and in-training assessment was introduced by a reform of postgraduate medical education in Denmark. An assessment programme covering the introductory year of anaesthesiology was constructed. The purpose of this study was to explore to which degree this programme was implemented in daily practice in the clinical departments and whether the recommended assessment protocol was followed. A questionnaire was distributed to 26 departments and 38 trainees. The response rate for both groups exceeded 90%. Individual learning plans were prepared by (2/3) of the trainees according to both trainees and departments. The various methods in the assessment programme were implemented to a high degree. The use of structured clinical observations was reported by more than 70% of both groups. Global assessments were applied in more than 70% according to both groups. Fifty percent of the trainees and 70% of the departments reported that these were used in accordance with recommendations. The trainees profited from preparing the written assignments  but only half of them found that they were used in accordance with recommendations. In contrast  more than 90% of the departments reported that the assignments were implemented according to recommendations. Practical completion of in-training assessment was considered difficult by 67% of the departments and 30% of trainees. The workload was the primary difficulty reported. In conclusion  the in-training assessment programme of the introductory year of anaesthesia has been implemented to a high degree and the assessment protocol is used according to recommendations.
Water Microbiology,,,Real-time PCR and NASBA for rapid and sensitive detection of Vibrio cholerae in ballast water. Transport of ballast water is one major factor in the transmission of aquatic organisms  including pathogenic bacteria. The IMO-guidelines of the Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments  states that ships are to discharge <1 CFU per 100 ml ballast water of toxigenic Vibrio cholerae  emphasizing the need to establish test methods. To our knowledge  there are no methods sensitive and rapid enough available for cholera surveillance of ballast water. In this study real-time PCR and NASBA methods have been evaluated to specifically detect 1 CFU/100ml of V. cholerae in ballast water. Ballast water samples spiked with V. cholerae cells were filtered and enriched in alkaline peptone water before PCR or NASBA detection. The entire method  including sample preparation and analysis was performed within 7 h  and has the potential to be used for analysis of ballast water for inspection and enforcement control.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Estimation of immunohistochemical expression of VEGF in ductal carcinomas of the breast. Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) is a very important growth factor in angiogenesis and holds potential as both a predictive marker for anti-angiogenic cancer treatment and a prognostic variable. Consequently  reliable estimation of VEGF expression is crucial. Investigators immunostained whole tumor sections for VEGF-A  VEGF-B  and VEGFR-1 of invasive ductal carcinomas of the breast and scored the tumors manually with staining intensity as the only parameter and by a combination of qualitative and quantitative information. The investigators also introduce an automated method for analyzing VEGF expression (so-called AI score) using the same tumor sections. Analysis of 100% of the tumor area was performed and the results were compared with the reduced analysis of 25% of the tumor area. These analyses were performed at ×5 and ×10 magnification  and each analysis was repeated in a second run with a new delineation of the tumor area. The AI scores were correlated to the manual scoring of VEGF intensity  but reproducibility of manual IHC scores was rather poor. The AI scores were reproducible  and the restricted analysis of 25% of the tumor area at ×5 magnifications was the most efficient considering time consumption and data load.
Histology,,,Summary of high field diffusion MRI and microscopy data demonstrate microstructural aberration in chronic mild stress rat brain. This data article describes a large  high resolution diffusion MRI data set from fixed rat brain acquired at high field strength. The rat brain samples consist of 21 adult rat brain hemispheres from animals exposed to chronic mild stress (anhedonic and resilient) and controls. Histology from amygdala of the same brain hemispheres is also included with three different stains: DiI and Hoechst stained microscopic images (confocal microscopy) and ALDH1L1 antibody based immunohistochemistry. These stains may be used to evaluate neurite density (DiI)  nuclear density (Hoechst) and astrocytic density (ALDH1L1). This combination of high field diffusion data and high resolution images from microscopy enables comparison of microstructural parameters derived from diffusion MRI to histological microstructure. The data provided here is used in the article (Jespersen  2016) [1].
Histology,,,Biophysical modeling of high field diffusion MRI demonstrates micro-structural aberration in chronic mild stress rat brain. Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Immense heterogeneity in symptoms of depression causes difficulty in diagnosis  and to date  there are no established biomarkers or imaging methods to examine depression. Unpredictable chronic mild stress (CMS) induced anhedonia is considered to be a realistic model of depression in studies of animal subjects. Stereological and neuronal tracing techniques have demonstrated persistent remodeling of microstructure in hippocampus  prefrontal cortex and amygdala of CMS brains. Recent developments in diffusion MRI (d-MRI) analyses  such as neurite density and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI)  are able to capture microstructural changes and are considered to be robust tools in preclinical and clinical imaging. The present study utilized d-MRI analyzed with a neurite density model and the DKI framework to investigate microstructure in the hippocampus  prefrontal cortex  caudate putamen and amygdala regions of CMS rat brains by comparison to brains from normal controls. To validate findings of CMS induced microstructural alteration  histology was performed to determine neurite  nuclear and astrocyte density. d-MRI based neurite density and tensor-based mean kurtosis (MKT) were significantly higher  while mean diffusivity (MD)  extracellular diffusivity (Deff) and intra-neurite diffusivity(DL) were significantly lower in the amygdala of CMS rat brains. Deff was also significantly lower in the hippocampus and caudate putamen in stressed groups. Histological neurite density corroborated the d-MRI findings in the amygdala and reductions in nuclear and astrocyte density further buttressed the d-MRI results. The present study demonstrated that the d-MRI based neurite density and MKT can reveal specific microstructural changes in CMS rat brains and these parameters might have value in clinical diagnosis of depression and for evaluation of treatment efficacy.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Scrotal granulomatous aspergillosis in a dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius). This report describes a case of primary subcutaneous aspergillosis in a 7-year-old neutered male dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius). The animal developed a large nodular lesion in the right scrotum two years after surgical intervention for neutering. The mass had a firm consistency and was painful at palpation. Histopathology revealed dermal granulomatous inflammation with a necrotic centre  surrounded by plasma cells  macrophages  neutrophils  and sparse fungal hyphae characterised by parallel cell walls  distinct septa  and dichotomous branching. Fungal culture was not performed  but a panel of mono- and polyclonal antibodies specific for different fungal genera identified the hyphae as Aspergillus sp. The occurrence of subcutaneous lesions is a rare manifestation of aspergillosis in animals  and this appears to be the first case reported in the dromedary camel.
Genetics,,,A 45-SNP genetic risk score is increased in early-onset coronary artery disease but independent of familial disease clustering. Common genetic risk variants may contribute to the heritability of early-onset coronary artery disease (CAD). We aimed to investigate the association of a genetic risk score (GRS) with age upon CAD-onset and to test the association between the GRS  familial clustering  and CAD severity in early-onset CAD. 134 early-onset CAD patients (<40 years)  446 late-onset CAD patients (male >55 years/female >65 years)  and 89 healthy controls were genotyped for 45 CAD-associated SNPs and a GRS was created. In early-onset CAD patients  family pedigrees with information on 1585 1st and 2nd degree relatives were used to calculate a stratified log-rank family score (SLFS) as a measure of familial clustering. Early-onset patients had a higher mean GRS than late-onset CAD patients (p = 0.02) and healthy controls (p < 0.0001). In the adjusted model  a GRS increase of one SD was associated with 1.2 years (95% CI 0.1-2.2) earlier onset. The GRS was not associated with the SLFS in the regression model (p = 0.41) and did not differ between SLFS tertiles (p = 0.98). The SLFS predicted the number of affected coronary vessels (OR [95% CI] per SD increase in SLFS: 2.0 [1.4-3.0])  whereas the association between the GRS and CAD severity was not statistically significant (OR [95% CI] per SD increase in GRS: 1.3 [0.9-1.9]). The GRS was increased in early-onset CAD patients  but not associated with the SLFS  suggesting that these common genetic variants are of minor importance in familial clustering of early-onset CAD. Furthermore  family pedigree analysis may predict CAD severity more precisely than common variants.
Histology,,,Characterization of hemorrhages in the ham topsides and tenderloins of slaughter pigs. The aim of the study was to characterize the different types of muscle hemorrhages in the ham and tenderloin of CO2-stunned slaughter pigs. The distinct types of hemorrhages were characterized according to their distribution and size. The hemorrhages in the ham were multiple  pinpoint hemorrhages predominantly distributed in the caudal part of the muscle. The hemorrhages in the tenderloin were single and circular  located either at the tip or the head. Histologically  three distinct types of hemorrhages were observed. Type 1  which was peracute (<4h old)  and present in both the ham and the tenderloin. Type 2  which was acute (>4h old)  and restricted to the ham. Type 3 contained bone marrow and cartilage  was peracute (< 4h old) and restricted to the tenderloin.
Global Health,,,Acetabular cup position and risk of dislocation in primary total hip arthroplasty. Background and purpose - Hip dislocation is one of the most common complications following total hip arthroplasty (THA). Several factors that affect dislocation have been identified  including acetabular cup positioning. Optimal values for cup inclination and anteversion are debatable. We performed a systematic review to describe the different methods for measuring cup placement  target zones for cup positioning  and the association between cup positioning and dislocation following primary THA. Methods - A systematic search of literature in the PubMed database was performed (January and February 2016) to identify articles that compared acetabular cup positioning and the risk of dislocation. Surgical approach and methods for measurement of cup angles were also considered. Results - 28 articles were determined to be relevant to our research question. Some articles demonstrated that cup positioning influenced postoperative dislocation whereas others did not. The majority of articles could not identify a statistically significant difference between dislocating and non-dislocating THA with regard to mean angles of cup anteversion and inclination. Most of the articles that assessed cup placement within the Lewinnek safe zone did not show a statistically significant reduction in dislocation rate. Alternative target ranges have been proposed by several authors. Interpretation - The Lewinnek safe zone could not be justified. It is difficult to draw broad conclusions regarding a definitive target zone for cup positioning in THA  due to variability between studies and the likely multifactorial nature of THA dislocation. Future studies comparing cup positioning and dislocation rate should investigate surgical approach separately. Standardized tools for measurement of cup positioning should be implemented to allow comparison between studies.
Nursing,,,Feasibility and Efficacy of Nurse-Driven Acute Stroke Care. Acute stroke care requires rapid assessment and intervention. Replacing traditional sequential algorithms in stroke care with parallel processing using telestroke consultation could be useful in the management of acute stroke patients. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of a nurse-driven acute stroke protocol using a parallel processing model. This is a prospective  nonrandomized  feasibility study of a quality improvement initiative. Stroke team members had a 1-month training phase  and then the protocol was implemented for 6 months and data were collected on a "run-sheet." The primary outcome of this study was to determine if a nurse-driven acute stroke protocol is feasible and assists in decreasing door to needle (intravenous tissue plasminogen activator [IV-tPA]) times. Of the 153 stroke patients seen during the protocol implementation phase  57 were designated as "level 1" (symptom onset <4.5 hours) strokes requiring acute stroke management. Among these strokes  78% were nurse-driven  and 75% of the telestroke encounters were also nurse-driven. The average door to computerized tomography time was significantly reduced in nurse-driven codes (38.9 minutes versus 24.4 minutes; P < .04). The use of a nurse-driven protocol is feasible and effective. When used in conjunction with a telestroke specialist  it may be of value in improving patient outcomes by decreasing the time for door to decision for IV-tPA.
Histology,,,"Ant-egg" cataract revisited. Hereditary congenital cataract varies immensely concerning location and form of the lens opacities. A specific and very rare phenotype is called "ant-egg" cataract first described in 1900. "Ant-eggs" have previously been examined using light microscopy  backscattered electron imaging and X-ray scans and electron microscopy. The purpose of this study was to further characterize "ant-egg" cataract using modern technology and display the history of the "ant-eggs" after cataract extraction. "Ant-eggs" were examined using Heidelberg SPECTRALIS Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)(Heidelberg Engineering  Heidelberg  Germany). Ten "ant-eggs" were extracted; four of these as well as control tissue were analyzed by mass spectrometry (AB Sciex). Proteins were identified and their approximate abundances were determined. Immunohistochemical staining was carried out on the remaining "ant-eggs" for cytokeratin and S100. In anterior OCT-images  the "ant-egg" structures are localized on the iris. Comparative pictures showed that they stayed in the same location for more than 45 years. Mass spectrometry of "ant-eggs" yielded a proteome of 56 different proteins. Eighteen of the 56 "ant-egg" proteins (32 %) were neither present in our controls nor in a known fetal lens proteome. Among these were cytokeratin and Matrix-Gla protein. Immunohistochemical reactions were positive for cytokeratin and S100. This study demonstrates the previously unknown protein composition of the "ant-egg" structures in "ant-egg" cataract. Eighteen of these proteins are not natively found in the human lens. Moreover  "ant-eggs" do not vary over time  after cataract extraction  regarding size and location.
Genetics  Population,,,Hypoglycemia  S-ACE and ACE genotypes in a Danish nationwide population of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. High S-ACE levels have been shown to predispose to increased risk of hypoglycemia  however; some inconsistency relates to the risk of the ACE genotype. We investigated the association between S-ACE level at diagnosis and ACE genotype to long-term risk of severe hypoglycemia in more than 1000 children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes being part of the Danish Registry of Childhood diabetes over a 10-yr period. The Registry provided annual registration of clinical data  e.g.  HbA1c  blood glucose monitoring  insulin type and dosage and acute diabetic complications (hypoglycemia and DKA). A BioBank coupled to the Registry comprised serum for measuring S-ACE levels and DNA for ACE genotyping. A total of 1037 individuals were included  aged 9.97 yr (SD 3.84). A total of 622 severe hypoglycemic episodes were observed in 270 individuals. Associations to increased risk of hypoglycemia generated from a negative binominal model were long diabetes duration (p < 0.0001) and high S-ACE level (p = 0.0497) when adjusted for ACE genotype. In the stratified analysis  S-ACE and insulin dosage were associated with hypoglycemia in girls (p = 0.026 and 0.028  respectively). An association of S-ACE level to ACE genotype was identified; however  no difference in the frequency of hypoglycemia  diabetes duration or HbA1c was demonstrated between ACE genotypes. This large nationwide cohort has identified an increased risk for hypoglycemia associated with higher S-ACE level  however only in girls. A strong association was found between ACE genotype and S-ACE levels  but ACE genotype was not related to risk of hypoglycemia.
Qualitative Research,Telemedicine,,Providing rehabilitation online - invisible work and diagnostic agents. Telecare promises to deliver healthcare services more efficiently while  at the same time  improving the quality of care. The purpose of this paper is to challenge these promises by analysing the implications of introducing telecare in the rehabilitation of patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Empirically  the paper is based on interviews with and observations of rehabilitation therapists and patients taking part in a Danish telerehabilitation programme. Theoretically  the paper draws on Science and Technology Studies. The introduction of telecare alters rehabilitation practices in multiple ways. First  several new time-consuming work routines  carried out in collaboration between therapists  patients and technical professions  emerge. Although crucial in establishing and maintaining telerehabilitation infrastructures  this work remains invisible in evaluations of the programme. Second  rather than simply increasing patient agency  responsibilities are redistributed and negotiated in subtle and non-uniform ways. These negotiations make it less transparent where one responsibility begins and where another potentially conflicting one ends. Evaluations of telecare technologies should pay more attention to work- and responsibility-related effects of introducing telecare in order better to account for predicted and unpredicted as well as desirable and undesirable socio-technical changes. Using an ethnographic approach  the paper points to the discrepancy between simplistic political promises that telecare technologies can serve as tools for improvement  on the one hand  and the substantial changes in the organisation and management of healthcare observed in practice  on the other. Rather than regarding telecare as technologies of improvement  it is more productive to regard them as technologies of change.
Gene Ontology,,,Long Noncoding RNA Expression during Human B-Cell Development. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as important regulators of diverse cellular processes  but their roles in the developing immune system are poorly understood. In this study  we analysed lncRNA expression during human B-cell development by array-based expression profiling of eleven distinct flow-sorted B-cell subsets  comprising pre-B1  pre-B2  immature  naive  memory  and plasma cells from bone marrow biopsies (n = 7)  and naive  centroblast  centrocyte  memory  and plasmablast cells from tonsil tissue samples (n = 6)  respectively. A remapping strategy was used to assign the array probes to 37630 gene-level probe sets  reflecting recent updates in genomic and transcriptomic databases  which enabled expression profiling of 19579 long noncoding RNAs  comprising 3947 antisense RNAs  5277 lincRNAs  7625 pseudogenes  and 2730 additional lncRNAs. As a first step towards inferring the functions of the identified lncRNAs in developing B-cells  we analysed their co-expression with well-characterized protein-coding genes  a method known as "guilt by association". By using weighted gene co-expression network analysis  we identified 272 lincRNAs  471 antisense RNAs  376 pseudogene RNAs  and 64 lncRNAs within seven sub-networks associated with distinct stages of B-cell development  such as early B-cell development  B-cell proliferation  affinity maturation of antibody  and terminal differentiation. These data provide an important resource for future studies on the functions of lncRNAs in development of the adaptive immune response  and the pathogenesis of B-cell malignancies that originate from distinct B-cell subpopulations.
Public Health,,,The rise and fall of the world's first fat tax. In 2011  Denmark introduced the world's first tax on saturated fat  but only 15 months later the fat tax was abolished. The aim of this article is to investigate the political processes surrounding the implementation and rapid abolition of the fat tax. Our findings suggest that industry and trade associations were heavily involved in the political process of formulating the fat tax. Industry representatives used certain tactics to oppose the fat tax: threatening lawsuits  predicting welfare losses  casting doubt on evidence  diverting focus and requesting postponement. After the fat tax was implemented  the food industry continued their opposition through intensified lobbyism and juridical actions at EU level. However  other factors seem to have contributed to the fall of the fat tax. The tax received criticism for being poorly designed and gradually lost popularity among health professionals  politicians and the public. In the end  the fat tax was abolished for financial reasons. This study demonstrates how politicians considered the fat tax as a funding source rather than a public health initiative  which resulted in significant shortcomings. Furthermore  we demonstrate that the massive influence by industry stakeholders was not balanced with inputs from public health professionals  who should assume a more proactive role in policy-making.
Soil Microbiology,,,Activity and composition of ammonia oxidizing bacterial communities and emission dynamics of NH3 and N2O in a compost reactor treating organic household waste. To monitor emissions of NH(3) and N(2)O during composting and link these to ammonia oxidation rates and the community structure of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB). A laboratory-scale compost reactor treating organic household waste was run for 2 months. NH(3) emissions peaked when pH started to increase. Small amounts of N(2)O and CH(4) were also produced. In total  16% and less than 1% of the initial N was lost as NH(3)-N and N(2)O-N respectively. The potential ammonia oxidation rate  determined by a chlorate inhibition assay  increased fourfold during the first 9 days and then remained high. Initially  both Nitrosospira and Nitrosomonas populations were detected using DGGE analysis of AOB specific 16S rRNA fragments. Only Nitrosomonas europaea was detected under thermophilic conditions  but Nitrosospira populations re-established during the cooling phase. Thermophilic conditions favoured high potential ammonia oxidation rates  suggesting that ammonia oxidation contributed to reduced NH(3) emissions. Small but significant amounts of N(2)O were emitted during the thermophilic phase. The significance of different AOBs detected in the compost for ammonia oxidation is not clear. This study shows that ammonia oxidation occurs at high temperature composting and therefore most likely reduces NH(3) emissions.
Soil Microbiology,,,Carbon turnover and ammonia emissions during composting of biowaste at different temperatures. The effects of different process temperatures (40  55  and 67 degrees C) during composting of source-separated household waste were studied in a 200 L compost reactor at an oxygen concentration of 16%. The overall decomposition measured as carbon mineralization  decomposition of different carbon constituents  and the dynamics of nitrogen mineralization and the microbial community  are reported. Ammonia emissions at 67 degrees C were more than double those at lower temperatures  and they were lowest at 40 degrees C. The decomposition rate  measured as CO2 emission  was highest at 55 degrees C. Decomposition of crude fat was slower at 40 degrees C than at 55 and 67 degrees C. The peak in microbial biomass was largest in the run at 40 degrees C  where substantial differences were seen in the microbial community structure and succession compared to thermophilic temperatures. Biowaste composting can be optimized to obtain both a high decomposition rate and low ammonia emissions by controlling the process at about 55 degrees C in the initial  high-rate stage. To reduce ammonia emissions it seems worthwhile to reduce the temperature after an initial high-temperature stage.
Outcome Assessment (Health Care),,,Score indices for predicting electrophysiologic outcomes in patients with unexplained syncope. Our ability to predict a positive electrophysiologic (EP) study in the evaluation of unexplained syncope is suboptimal. In patients with unexplained syncope  we defined clinical predictors of bradyarrhythmia and ventricular tachycardia (VT) diagnosed during EP study  constructed diagnostic score indices for bradyarrhythmia and VT  and evaluated the predictive power of each score index. All patients evaluated in the Arrhythmia Clinic for unexplained syncope from January 1  1996  through December 31  1998  were identified and enrolled in the study. Five hundred eight patients (325 [64%] men; mean+/-SD age  64+/-17 years) underwent EP testing. We analyzed elements from historical data and noninvasive laboratory findings as predictors of bradyarrhythmia and VT diagnosed on EP study. Fifty-eight patients (11%) had sinus node dysfunction  94 (19%) had atrioventricular (AV) node disease  92 (18%) had His-Purkinje system disease  and 101 (20%) had VT. Models were fit using logistic regression analysis. Predictors were assigned weighted scores  and a score index was formulated. The area under the curve associated with sinus node dysfunction  AV node disease  His-Purkinje system disease  and VT models was 0.64  0.60  0.84  and 0.60  respectively. We have constructed diagnostic score indices for EP outcomes of bradyarrhythmia and VT in syncope. Of all the score indices  the model for His-Purkinje system disease has the highest predictive power.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Impact of the application of the American College of Emergency Physicians recommendations for the admission of patients with syncope on a retrospectively studied population presenting to the emergency department. The goal of our study was to determine the accuracy of the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) clinical policy in identifying patients with a cardiac cause for their syncope and its potential effect on syncope management. Adult patients with syncope presenting to the emergency department (ED) from January 1996 to December 1998 were identified. Diagnosis was established retrospectively by reviewing medical records. The ACEP guidelines were applied to this population. Of the 200 patients identified  115 (57.5%  95% CI 60-64) were admitted from the ED and 24 (12%) were found to have cardiogenic syncope. Of the 24 patients with cardiac syncope  23 were admitted. By applying ACEP level B recommendations to our population  all patients who on further workup were found to have cardiac syncope would have been admitted from the ED (100% sensitivity  95% CI 86-100) and 81% of patients with no cardiac syncope would have been discharged from the ED (81% specificity  95% CI 75-87). The admission rate would have been 28.5% (95% CI 22-35). By extending admission to patients satisfying level C in addition to level B recommendations  the sensitivity  specificity  and admission rate would have been 100% (95% CI 86-100)  33% (95% CI 26-40)  and 71.0% (95% CI 64-77)  respectively. High sensitivity and specificity in identifying patients with cardiogenic syncope and significant reduction in the hospital admission rate were observed by applying ACEP level B recommendations to patients presenting to our ED. Application of level C recommendations did not offer any advantage.
Outcome Assessment (Health Care),,,Effect of exercise treadmill testing and stress imaging on the triage of patients with chest pain: CHEER substudy. To determine whether stress imaging for patients who are unsuitable for exercise treadmill testing (ETT) as part of a chest pain unit (CPU) triage strategy resulted in incremental benefit in clinical outcomes and relative costs compared with patients randomized to routine hospital admission. Clinical outcomes and medical resource utilization were examined at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester  Minn  for 212 intermediate-risk patients with unstable angina randomized to a CPU and compared with 212 patients randomized to routine admission from November 21  1995  to March 18  1997. Patients in stable condition in the CPU underwent ETT; if patients were unsuitable for ETT  stress imaging was performed. Costs for CPU evaluation and outcomes were assessed during a 6-month follow-up. During the observation period  60 patients (28%) were admitted to the hospital. Of the 152 remaining patients  125 (82%) underwent ETT (91 had normal results)  and 27 (18%) underwent stress imaging (3 had normal results). Patients with normal ETT or stress imaging results had no primary events at 6-month follow-up. Patients admitted to the hospital who underwent stress imaging had an insignificantly higher 6-month event rate compared with patients who underwent ETT (16.7% vs 8.1%; P=.38). The standardized resource-based relative-value units (RBRVUs) for patients who underwent ETT and stress imaging during follow-up were 19.4 and 56.4 RBRVUs  respectively  compared with 51.4 (ETT) and 52.1 (stress imaging) RBRVUs for similar numbers of patients randomized to routine admission. Exercise treadmill testing safely stratified most intermediate-risk patients with unstable angina and was less costly than routine admission. Patients not suitable for ETT are likely to have abnormal stress imaging results. They represent a higher-risk cohort that could be routinely admitted to the hospital without reducing the effectiveness of the CPU strategy.
Cardiology,,,Electrical and structural adaptations of the paediatric athlete's heart: a systematic review with meta-analysis. To describe the electrocardiographic (ECG) and echocardiographic manifestations of the paediatric athlete's heart  and examine the impact of age  race and sex on cardiac remodelling responses to competitive sport. Systematic review with meta-analysis. Six electronic databases were searched to May 2016: MEDLINE  PubMed  EMBASE  Web of Science  CINAHL and SPORTDiscus. (1) Male and/or female competitive athletes  (2) participants aged 6-18 years  (3) original research article published in English language. Data from 14 278 athletes and 1668 non-athletes were included for qualitative (43 articles) and quantitative synthesis (40 articles). Paediatric athletes demonstrated a greater prevalence of training-related and training-unrelated ECG changes than non-athletes. Athletes ≥14 years were 15.8 times more likely to have inferolateral T-wave inversion than athletes <14 years. Paediatric black athletes had significantly more training-related and training-unrelated ECG changes than Caucasian athletes. Age was a positive predictor of left ventricular (LV) internal diameter during diastole  interventricular septum thickness during diastole  relative wall thickness and LV mass. When age was accounted for  these parameters remained significantly larger in athletes than non-athletes. Paediatric black athletes presented larger posterior wall thickness during diastole (PWTd) than Caucasian athletes. Paediatric male athletes also presented larger PWTd than females. The paediatric athlete's heart undergoes significant remodelling both before and during 'maturational years'. Paediatric athletes have a greater prevalence of training related and training-unrelated ECG changes than non-athletes  with age  race and sex mediating factors on cardiac electrical and LV structural remodelling.
Photochemistry,,,Site-specific photocoupling of pBpa mutated scFv antibodies for use in affinity proteomics. Recombinant antibody libraries can provide a source of renewable and high-performing binders tailored for use in affinity proteomics. In this context  the process of generating site-specific 1:1 tagging/functionalization and/or orientated surface immobilization of antibodies has  however  proved to be challenging. Hence  novel ways of generating such engineered antibodies for use in affinity proteomics could have a major impact on array performance. In this study  we have further tailored the design of human recombinant scFv antibodies for site-specific photocoupling through the use of an unnatural amino acid (UAA) and the Dock'n'Flash technology. In more detail  we have generated the 2nd generation of scFvs carrying the photoreactive UAA p-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine (pBpa). Based on key properties  such as expression levels  activity  and affinity  a preferred choice of site for pBpa  located in the beginning of the C-terminal affinity-tag  was for the first time pin-pointed. Further  the results showed that pBpa mutated antibody could be site-specifically photocoupled to free and surface immobilized β-cyclodextrin (an affinity ligand to pBpa). This paves the way for use of scFv antibodies  engineered for site-specific photochemical-based tagging  functionalization  and orientated surface immobilization  in affinity proteomics.
Clinical Competence,Education  Medical  Continuing,Models  Educational,Design of simulation-based medical education and advantages and disadvantages of in situ simulation versus off-site simulation. Simulation-based medical education (SBME) has traditionally been conducted as off-site simulation in simulation centres. Some hospital departments also provide off-site simulation using in-house training room(s) set up for simulation away from the clinical setting  and these activities are called in-house training. In-house training facilities can be part of hospital departments and resemble to some extent simulation centres but often have less technical equipment. In situ simulation  introduced over the past decade  mainly comprises of team-based activities and occurs in patient care units with healthcare professionals in their own working environment. Thus  this intentional blend of simulation and real working environments means that in situ simulation brings simulation to the real working environment and provides training where people work. In situ simulation can be either announced or unannounced  the latter also known as a drill. This article presents and discusses the design of SBME and the advantage and disadvantage of the different simulation settings  such as training in simulation-centres  in-house simulations in hospital departments  announced or unannounced in situ simulations. Non-randomised studies argue that in situ simulation is more effective for educational purposes than other types of simulation settings. Conversely  the few comparison studies that exist  either randomised or retrospective  show that choice of setting does not seem to influence individual or team learning. However  hospital department-based simulations  such as in-house simulation and in situ simulation  lead to a gain in organisational learning. To our knowledge no studies have compared announced and unannounced in situ simulation. The literature suggests some improved organisational learning from unannounced in situ simulation; however  unannounced in situ simulation was also found to be challenging to plan and conduct  and more stressful among participants. The importance of setting  context and fidelity are discussed. Based on the current limited research we suggest that choice of setting for simulations does not seem to influence individual and team learning. Department-based local simulation  such as simulation in-house and especially in situ simulation  leads to gains in organisational learning. The overall objectives of simulation-based education and factors such as feasibility can help determine choice of simulation setting.
Anesthesiology,Clinical Competence,Educational Measurement,Using a Structured Assessment Tool to Evaluate Nontechnical Skills of Nurse Anesthetists. Nontechnical skills are critical for good anesthetic practice but are seldom addressed explicitly in clinical training. The purposes of this study were (1) to evaluate the reliability and validity of the observation-based assessment tool Nurse Anaesthetists' Non-Technical Skills system (N-ANTS) and (2) to evaluate the effect of training nurse anesthetist supervisors in the use of N-ANTS. This system comprises a global rating score  4 categories  and 15 elements to rate nurse anesthetists' nontechnical skills. A 1-day workshop was conducted for 22 nurse anesthetist supervisors to rate nurse anesthetists' nontechnical skills in 9 scripted video scenarios. Data were gathered from 2 rating sessions separated by a 2-hour training session. The interrater reliability was high before and after the training. It remained stable for the global rating score in N-ANTS and its category ratings  but improved at the elements level. When the raters' ratings were compared with ratings by an expert reference group  there was no statistically significant effect on training. We conclude that Danish nurse anesthetist supervisors without further rater training besides their work experience can use N-ANTS to assess nontechnical skills of nurse anesthetists.
Clinical Competence,Educational Measurement,Midwifery,Simulation-based multiprofessional obstetric anaesthesia training conducted in situ versus off-site leads to similar individual and team outcomes: a randomised educational trial. To investigate the effect of in situ simulation (ISS) versus off-site simulation (OSS) on knowledge  patient safety attitude  stress  motivation  perceptions of simulation  team performance and organisational impact. Investigator-initiated single-centre randomised superiority educational trial. Obstetrics and anaesthesiology departments  Rigshospitalet  University of Copenhagen  Denmark. 100 participants in teams of 10  comprising midwives  specialised midwives  auxiliary nurses  nurse anaesthetists  operating theatre nurses  and consultant doctors and trainees in obstetrics and anaesthesiology. Two multiprofessional simulations (clinical management of an emergency caesarean section and a postpartum haemorrhage scenario) were conducted in teams of 10 in the ISS versus the OSS setting. Knowledge assessed by a multiple choice question test. Individual outcomes: scores on the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire  stress measurements (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory  cognitive appraisal and salivary cortisol)  Intrinsic Motivation Inventory and perceptions of simulations. Team outcome: video assessment of team performance. Organisational impact: suggestions for organisational changes. The trial was conducted from April to June 2013. No differences between the two groups were found for the multiple choice question test  patient safety attitude  stress measurements  motivation or the evaluation of the simulations. The participants in the ISS group scored the authenticity of the simulation significantly higher than did the participants in the OSS group. Expert video assessment of team performance showed no differences between the ISS versus the OSS group. The ISS group provided more ideas and suggestions for changes at the organisational level. In this randomised trial  no significant differences were found regarding knowledge  patient safety attitude  motivation or stress measurements when comparing ISS versus OSS. Although participant perception of the authenticity of ISS versus OSS differed significantly  there were no differences in other outcomes between the groups except that the ISS group generated more suggestions for organisational changes.

Anesthesiology,Clinical Competence,,Customisation of an instrument to assess anaesthesiologists' non-technical skills. The objectives of the study were to identify Danish anaesthesiologists' non-technical skills and to customise the Scottish-developed Anaesthetists' Non-Technical Skills instrument for Danish anaesthesiologists. Six semi-structured group interviews were conducted with 31 operating room team members: anaes-thesiologists  nurse anaesthetists  surgeons  and scrub nurses. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using directed content analysis. Anaesthesiologists' non-technical skills were identified  coded  and sorted using the original instrument as a basis. The resulting prototype instrument was discussed with anaesthesiologists from 17 centres to ensure face validity. Interviews lasted 46-67 minutes. Identified examples of anaesthesiologists' good or poor non-technical skills fit the four categories in the original instrument: situation awareness; decision making; team working; and task management. Anaesthesiologists' leadership role in the operating room was emphasised: the original 'Task Management' category was named 'Leadership'. One new element  'Demonstrating self-awareness' was added under the category 'Situation Awareness'. Compared with the original instrument  half of the behavioural markers were new  which reflected that being aware of and communicating one's own abilities to the team; working systematically; and speaking up to avoid adverse events were important skills. The Anaesthetists' Non-Technical Skills instrument was customised to a Danish setting using the identified non-technical skills for anaesthesiologists and the original instrument as basis. The customised instrument comprises four categories and 16 underpinning elements supported by multiple behavioural markers. Identifying non-technical skills through semi-structured group interviews and analysing them using direct content analysis proved a useful method for customising an assessment instrument to another setting.
Clinical Competence,Education  Medical,,Factors relating to the perceived management of emergency situations: a survey of former Advanced Life Support course participants' clinical experiences. This study explored individual  team  and setting factors associated with the quality of management of in-hospital emergency situations experienced by former Advanced Life Support (ALS) course participants. This study was a survey of former ALS course participants' long-term experience of management of in-hospital  emergency situations. The survey was carried out in 2012 in Denmark and Norway. A questionnaire was send to 526 potential responders and (281/479 × 100) 58.7% responded. The results demonstrated that 75% of the emergency situations were perceived as "managed well". In general  the responders' confidence in being ALS providers was high  mean 4.3 (SD 0.8)  scale 1-5. Significant differences between the perceived "well" and "not well" managed situations were found for all questions  p<0.001. The largest differences related to perception of co-workers' ability to apply ALS principles  the team atmosphere and communication. Responders' ratings of quality of management of emergency situations increased with intensity of setting. However  the 'clinical setting' was rated significantly lower as attributor to ability to apply ALS principles compared to 'co-workers familiarity with ALS principles'  'own confidence as ALS-provider' and 'own social/inter-personal skills'. The results of this survey emphasise that ALS providers' perceived ability to apply ALS skills were substantially affected by teamwork skills and co-workers' skills. Team related factors associated with successful outcome were related to clear role distribution  clear inter-personal communication and attentive listening  as well as respectful behaviour and positive team atmosphere. Although intensity of setting was attributed to ability to apply ALS principles  this did not affect management of emergency situations to the same extent as individual and team factors.
Qualitative Research,,,Debriefing bystanders of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is valuable. To explore the concept of debriefing bystanders after participating in an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest resuscitation attempt including (1) bystanders' most commonly addressed reactions after participating in a resuscitation attempt when receiving debriefing from medical dispatchers; (2) their perception of effects of receiving debriefing and (3) bystanders' recommendations for a systematic debriefing concept. Qualitative study based on telephone debriefing to bystanders and interviews with bystanders who received debriefing. Data was analyzed using the phenomenological approach. Six themes emerged from analysis of debriefing audio files: (1) identification of OHCA; (2) emotional and perceptual experience with OHCA; (3) collaboration with healthcare professionals; (4) patients outcome; (5) coping with the experience and (6) general reflections. When evaluating the concept  bystanders expressed positive short term effect of receiving debriefing and a retention of this effect after two months. Recommendations for a future debriefing concept were given. Debriefing by emergency medical dispatchers to OHCA bystanders stimulates reflection  positively influencing the ability to cope with the emotional reactions and the cognitive perception of own performance and motivates improvement of CPR skills. Importantly  it increases confidence to provide CPR in the future. Implementation of telephone debriefing to bystanders at Emergency Medical Dispatch Centres is a low complexity and a low cost intervention though the logistic challenges have to be considered.
Education  Medical,,,Time matters--realism in resuscitation training. The advanced life support guidelines recommend 2min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and minimal hands-off time to ensure sufficient cardiac and cerebral perfusion. We have observed doctors who shorten the CPR intervals during resuscitation attempts. During simulation-based resuscitation training  the recommended 2-min CPR cycles are often deliberately decreased in order to increase the number of scenarios. The aim of this study was to test if keeping 2-min CPR cycles during resuscitation training ensures better adherence to time during resuscitation in a simulated setting. This study was designed as a randomised control trial. Fifty-four 4th-year medical students with no prior advanced resuscitation training participated in an extra-curricular one-day advanced life support course. Participants were either randomised to simulation-based training using real-time (120s) or shortened CPR cycles (30-45s instead of 120s) in the scenarios. Adherence to time was measured using the European Resuscitation Council's Cardiac Arrest Simulation Test (CASTest) in retention tests conducted one and 12 weeks after the course. The real-time group adhered significantly better to the recommended 2-min CPR cycles (time-120s) (mean 13; standard derivation (SD) 8) than the shortened CPR cycle group (mean 45; SD 19) when tested (p<0.001.) This study indicates that time is an important part of fidelity. Variables critical for performance  like adherence to time in resuscitation  should therefore be kept realistic during training to optimise outcome.
Clinical Competence,Education  Medical  Graduate,Models  Educational,[Experience with the training of non-technical skills on a course for surgical trainees]. This paper describes the introduction of the training of non-technical skills on a mandatory course for surgical trainees. The training consisted of an introduction to non-technical skills in a plenum session and was followed by a full-scale simulation with debriefing in which participants reflected on their actions. Evaluations showed that > 90% of the participants found that the subject was relevant for their further training and some requested more simulation training. The course hereby addresses several of the Danish seven roles of a fully trained specialist doctor.
Patient Simulation,,,Augmenting health care failure modes and effects analysis with simulation. This study explores whether simulation plays a role in health care failure mode and effects analysis (HFMEA); it does this by evaluating whether additional data are found when a traditional HFMEA is augmented with simulation. Two multidisciplinary teams identified vulnerabilities in a process by brainstorming  followed by simulation. Two means of adding simulation were investigated as follows: just simulating the process and interrupting the simulation between substeps of the process. By adding simulation to a traditional HFMEA  both multidisciplinary teams identified additional data that were relevant for deeper analysis. The study indicates that simulation has a role in HFMEA. Both ways of using simulation seemed feasible  and our results are not conclusive in selecting one over the other.
Clinical Competence,Midwifery,Teaching,Helping mothers survive bleeding after birth: an evaluation of simulation-based training in a low-resource setting. To evaluate "Helping Mothers Survive Bleeding After Birth" (HMS BAB) simulation-based training in a low-resource setting. Educational intervention study. Rural referral hospital in Northern Tanzania. Clinicians  nurse-midwives  medical attendants  and ambulance drivers involved in maternity care. In March 2012  health care workers were trained in HMS BAB  a half-day simulation-based training  using a train-the-trainer model. The training focused on basic delivery care  active management of third stage of labor  and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage  including bimanual uterine compression. Evaluation questionnaires provided information on course perception. Knowledge  skills  and confidence of facilitators and learners were tested before and after training. Four master trainers trained eight local facilitators  who subsequently trained 89 learners. After training  all facilitators passed the knowledge test  but pass rates for the skills test were low (29% pass rate for basic delivery and 0% pass rate for management of postpartum hemorrhage). Evaluation revealed that HMS BAB training was considered acceptable and feasible  although more time should be allocated for training  and teaching materials should be translated into the local language. Knowledge  skills  and confidence of learners increased significantly immediately after training. However  overall pass rates for skills tests of learners after training were low (3% pass rate for basic delivery and management of postpartum hemorrhage). The HMS BAB simulation-based training has potential to contribute to education of health care providers. We recommend a full day of training and validation of the facilitators to improve the training.
Genomics,,,Genomic and transcriptomic resources for assassin flies including the complete genome sequence of Proctacanthus coquilletti (Insecta: Diptera: Asilidae) and 16 representative transcriptomes. A high-quality draft genome for Proctacanthus coquilletti (Insecta: Diptera: Asilidae) is presented along with transcriptomes for 16 Diptera species from five families: Asilidae  Apioceridae  Bombyliidae  Mydidae  and Tabanidae. Genome sequencing reveals that P. coquilletti has a genome size of approximately 210 Mbp and remarkably low heterozygosity (0.47%) and few repeats (15%). These characteristics helped produce a highly contiguous (N50 = 862 kbp) assembly  particularly given that only a single 2 × 250 bp PCR-free Illumina library was sequenced. A phylogenomic hypothesis is presented based on thousands of putative orthologs across the 16 transcriptomes. Phylogenetic relationships support the sister group relationship of Apioceridae + Mydidae to Asilidae. A time-calibrated phylogeny is also presented  with seven fossil calibration points  which suggests an older age of the split among Apioceridae  Asilidae  and Mydidae (158 mya) and Apioceridae and Mydidae (135 mya) than proposed in the AToL FlyTree project. Future studies will be able to take advantage of the resources presented here in order to produce large scale phylogenomic and evolutionary studies of assassin fly phylogeny  life histories  or venom. The bioinformatics tools and workflow presented here will be useful to others wishing to generate de novo genomic resources in species-rich taxa without a closely-related reference genome.
Grounded Theory,,,Alcoholic liver disease patients' perspective of a coping and physical activity-oriented rehabilitation intervention after hepatic encephalopathy. To identify and describe the impact of a coping and physical activity-oriented rehabilitation intervention on alcoholic liver disease patients after hepatic encephalopathy in terms of their interaction with professionals and relatives. Patients who have experienced alcohol-induced hepatic encephalopathy have reduced quality of life  multiple complications  and social problems  and rehabilitation opportunities for these patients are limited. A grounded theory study and an evaluation study of a controlled intervention study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 alcoholic liver disease patients who were diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy and participated in a coping and physical activity-oriented rehabilitation intervention. Richard S. Lazarus's theory of stress and coping inspired the interview guide. The significance of a coping and physical activity-oriented rehabilitation intervention on alcoholic liver disease patients' ability to cope with problems after surviving alcohol-induced hepatic encephalopathy in terms of their interaction with professionals and relatives was characterised by the core category 'regain control over the diseased body'. This is subdivided into three separate categories: 'the experience of being physically strong'  'togetherness' and 'self-control'  and they impact each other and are mutually interdependent. Alcoholic liver disease patients described the strength of the rehabilitation as regaining control over the diseased body. Professionals and relatives of patients with alcoholic liver disease may need to focus on strengthening and preserving patients' control of their diseased body by facilitating the experience of togetherness  self-control and physical strength when interacting with and supporting patients with alcoholic liver disease. A coping and physical activity-oriented rehabilitation intervention may help alcoholic liver disease patients to regain control over their diseased body and give patients the experience of togetherness  self-control and physical strength. Professionals should be aware of giving the patients the experience of togetherness in their interactions  help them perceive self-control and gain physical strength during their rehabilitation.
Grounded Theory,,,Coping and rehabilitation in alcoholic liver disease patients after hepatic encephalopathy--in interaction with professionals and relatives. To identify and describe conditions that limit or support patients  with alcoholic liver disease after surviving alcohol-induced hepatic encephalopathy  ability to cope with current and potential physical and psychosocial problems--in interaction with professionals and relatives--and to recommend appropriate interventions. Alcoholic liver disease patients surviving alcohol-induced hepatic encephalopathy have significantly impaired quality of life. Internationally  there is a lack of knowledge about the conditions that affect alcoholic liver disease patients' coping and rehabilitation. A grounded theory study. Semi-structured interviews  conducted with 11 alcoholic liver disease patients who were diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy. The interview guide was inspired by Richard S. Lazarus's theory of stress and coping. The elements that support or limit alcoholic liver disease patients' ability to cope with physical and psychosocial problems in interaction with professionals and relatives were represented by the core category 'Struggle for preservation of identity as a significant individual'. It was characterised by three categories  which are interrelated and impact upon each other: 'Acknowledgement'  'Struggle to maintain control' and 'Achieving a sense of security'. Alcoholic liver disease patients experience a struggle to preserve their identity as a significant individual. It can be assumed that professionals and relatives in their interaction with  and support of  patients should focus on strengthening and preserving patients' identity in the form of acknowledgement  helping alcoholic liver disease patients maintain self-control and providing a safety net so patients feel a sense of security. It can be assumed that professionals should support alcoholic liver disease patients' appraisal of  and coping with  physical and psychosocial problems based on acknowledgment  understanding and a sympathetic attitude. Professionals should proactively approach patients when they withdraw. It may be useful for professionals to be aware of alcoholic liver disease patients' individual coping strategies and thereby their individual requirements for professional supportive intervention.
Pharmacoepidemiology,,,Evaluation of an ICD-10 algorithm to detect osteonecrosis of the jaw among cancer patients in the Danish National Registry of Patients. This study aimed to validate a predefined algorithm for osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) among cancer patients in the Danish National Registry of Patients and to assess the nature of clinical information recorded in medical charts of ONJ patients. We identified potential ONJ cases recorded in 2005-2010 among cancer patients at the hospital Departments of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (DOMS) in three Danish regions  using a set of codes from the International Classification of Diseases  10th revision (ICD-10). We abstracted DOMS charts of the potential cases  had the ONJ status adjudicated by an expert ONJ adjudication committee (ONJAC)  and computed positive predictive values. For patients with ONJAC-confirmed ONJ  we abstracted the charts for information on ONJ clinical course. Sensitivity of the algorithm was computed using a separate sample of 101 known ONJ cases accrued in 2005-2011. We identified 212 potential ONJ cases  of which 197 (93%) had charts available for abstraction. Eighty-three potential cases were confirmed by ONJAC  with a positive predictive value of 42% (95% confidence interval [CI] 35%-49%). DOMS charts of these 83 cases contained complete information on ONJ clinical course. Information about antiresorptive treatment was recorded for 84% of the patients. Among the 101 known ONJ cases  74 had at least one prespecified ICD-10 code recorded in the Danish National Registry of Patients within ±90 days of the ONJ diagnosis (sensitivity 73%; 95%CI [64%-81%]). The predefined algorithm is not adequate for monitoring ONJ in pharmacovigilance studies. Additional case-finding approaches  coupled with adjudication  are necessary to estimate ONJ incidence accurately.
Proteomics,,,The Human Skeletal Muscle Proteome Project: a reappraisal of the current literature. Skeletal muscle is a large organ that accounts for up to half the total mass of the human body. A progressive decline in muscle mass and strength occurs with ageing and in some individuals configures the syndrome of 'sarcopenia'  a condition that impairs mobility  challenges autonomy  and is a risk factor for mortality. The mechanisms leading to sarcopenia as well as myopathies are still little understood. The Human Skeletal Muscle Proteome Project was initiated with the aim to characterize muscle proteins and how they change with ageing and disease. We conducted an extensive review of the literature and analysed publically available protein databases. A systematic search of peer-reviewed studies was performed using PubMed. Search terms included 'human'  'skeletal muscle'  'proteome'  'proteomic(s)'  and 'mass spectrometry'  'liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)'. A catalogue of 5431 non-redundant muscle proteins identified by mass spectrometry-based proteomics from 38 peer-reviewed scientific publications from 2002 to November 2015 was created. We also developed a nosology system for the classification of muscle proteins based on localization and function. Such inventory of proteins should serve as a useful background reference for future research on changes in muscle proteome assessed by quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomic approaches that occur with ageing and diseases. This classification and compilation of the human skeletal muscle proteome can be used for the identification and quantification of proteins in skeletal muscle to discover new mechanisms for sarcopenia and specific muscle diseases that can be targeted for the prevention and treatment.
Evidence-Based Medicine,Thoracic Surgery,,Use of incisional negative pressure wound therapy on closed median sternal incisions after cardiothoracic surgery: clinical evidence and consensus recommendations. Negative pressure wound therapy is a concept introduced initially to assist in the treatment of chronic open wounds. Recently  there has been growing interest in using the technique on closed incisions after surgery to prevent potentially severe surgical site infections and other wound complications in high-risk patients. Negative pressure wound therapy uses a negative pressure unit and specific dressings that help to hold the incision edges together  redistribute lateral tension  reduce edema  stimulate perfusion  and protect the surgical site from external infectious sources. Randomized  controlled studies of negative pressure wound therapy for closed incisions in orthopedic settings (which also is a clean surgical procedure in absence of an open fracture) have shown the technology can reduce the risk of wound infection  wound dehiscence  and seroma  and there is accumulating evidence that it also improves wound outcomes after cardiothoracic surgery. Identifying at-risk individuals for whom prophylactic use of negative pressure wound therapy would be most cost-effective remains a challenge; however  several risk-stratification systems have been proposed and should be evaluated more fully. The recent availability of a single-use  closed incision management system offers surgeons a convenient and practical means of delivering negative pressure wound therapy to their high-risk patients  with excellent wound outcomes reported to date. Although larger  randomized  controlled studies will help to clarify the precise role and benefits of such a system in cardiothoracic surgery  limited initial evidence from clinical studies and from the authors' own experiences appears promising. In light of the growing interest in this technology among cardiothoracic surgeons  a consensus meeting  which was attended by a group of international experts  was held to review existing evidence for negative pressure wound therapy in the prevention of wound complications after surgery and to provide recommendations on the optimal use of negative pressure wound therapy on closed median sternal incisions after cardiothoracic surgery.
Qualitative Research,,,Practice guidelines in the context of primary care  learning and usability in the physicians' decision-making process--a qualitative study. Decision-making is central for general practitioners (GP). Practice guidelines are important tools in this process but implementation of them in the complex context of primary care is a challenge. The purpose of this study was to explore how GPs approach  learn from and use practice guidelines in their day-to-day decision-making process in primary care. A qualitative approach using focus-group interviews was chosen in order to provide in-depth information. The participants were 22 GPs with a median of seven years of experience in primary care  representing seven primary healthcare centres in Stockholm  Sweden in 2011. The interviews focused on how the GPs use guidelines in their decision-making  factors that influence their decision how to approach these guidelines  and how they could encourage the learning process in routine practice.Data were analysed by qualitative content analysis. Meaning units were condensed and grouped in categories. After interpreting the content in the categories  themes were created. Three themes were conceptualized. The first theme emphasized to use guidelines by interactive contextualized dialogues. The categories underpinning this theme: 1. Feedback by peer-learning 2. Feedback by collaboration  mutual learning  and equality between specialties  identified important ways to achieve this learning dialogue. Confidence was central in the second theme  learning that establishes confidence to provide high quality care. Three aspects of confidence were identified in the categories of this theme: 1. Confidence by confirmation  2. Confidence by reliability and 3. Confidence by evaluation of own results. In the third theme  learning by use of relevant evidence in the decision-making process  we identified two categories: 1. Design and lay-out visualizing the evidence 2. Accessibility adapted to the clinical decision-making process as prerequisites for using the practice guidelines. Decision-making in primary care is a dual process that involves use of intuitive and analytic thinking in a balanced way in order to provide high quality care. Key aspects of effective learning in this clinical decision-making process were: contextualized dialogue  which was based on the GPs' own experiences  feedback on own results and easy access to short guidelines perceived as trustworthy.
Family Practice,,,HbAlc in an unselected population of 4438 people with type 2 diabetes in a Danish county. To describe the use and level of HbA1c in a large unselected Type 2 diabetic population in Denmark. In addition  to describe the characteristics of the patients and the general practitioners in relation to the monitoring of HbA1c. Data were collected from public data files for the period January 1993 to December 1997. The County of Vejle with a background population of 342 597 citizens  303 250 of whom were listed with participating general practitioners. The Type 2 diabetic population alive and resident in the county on 1 January 1997. In a population of 4438 Type 2 diabetics  73% had a minimum of one annual HbA1c measurement in 1997. No HbA1c measurement was associated with a long history of diabetes  diet treatment or old age. Poor glycaemic regulation was found in 65% of the Type 2 diabetics in 1997. Poor glycaemic regulation was associated with tablet or insulin treatment  age under 70 years and long history of diabetes. The interpractice variation was huge. The quality of HbA1c monitoring of Type 2 diabetics needs to be improved. Possibilities for improvement seem to be present.
Family Practice,,,[C-reactive protein and infections in general practice]. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a sensitive and non-specific inflammatory marker. The serum level of CRP starts to rise 6-12 hours after the start of an inflammatory stimulus. Sequential CRP measurements will have greater diagnostic value than a single measurement  and changes of the CRP values often reflect the clinical course. In use in general practice the diagnostic value of CRP is found to be high in adults with pneumonia  sinusitis and tonsillitis  however it is found to be low regarding otitis and pneumonia in children. As to urinary tract infections and salpingitis the value is still undefined. Measurement of CRP is an important diagnostic test but the analysis should not stand by itself but be evaluated together with the patient's history and clinical examination.
Family Practice,Health Services Research,,Near-patient test for C-reactive protein in general practice: assessment of clinical  organizational  and economic outcomes. The benefits of near-patient  point-of-care tests have not been fully examined. We have assessed the clinical  organizational  and economic outcomes of implementing a near-patient test for C-reactive protein (CRP) in general practice. In a randomized crossover trial during intervention periods  general practitioners (GPs) were allowed to measure CRP within 3 min  using NycoCard(R) CRP. During control periods  they had to mail blood samples for CRP measurements to the hospital laboratory and received test results 24-48 h later. Twenty-nine general practice clinics participated (64 GPs)  and 1853 patients were included in the study. Results were evaluated at both the level of participating GPs and the level of included patients. For participating GPs  the overall use of erythrocyte sedimentation rates (ESRs) decreased by 8% (95% confidence interval  1-14%) during intervention periods  and the number of blood samples mailed to the hospital laboratory decreased by 6% (1-10%). No reduction in the prescription of antibiotics was seen. The proportion of study patients having a follow-up telephone consultation was reduced from 63% to 53% (P = 0. 0001)  and patients with CRP concentrations >50 mg/L had their antibiotic treatments started earlier when CRP was measured in general practices (P = 0.0161). The implementation of the near-patient CRP test was cost-effective mainly on the basis of a reduction in the use of services from the hospital laboratory by GPs. If the implementation is followed by education and clinical guidelines  opportunities exist for additional reduction in the use of ESR and for a more appropriate use of antibiotics.
Family Practice,,,[Differences in the use of C-reactive protein analysis and erythrocyte sedimentation in general practice and hospitals. Development from 1986 to 1995]. Analysis for C-reactive protein (CRP) was introduced in the Vejle Hospital catchment area in 1987. During the next ten year period the use of CRP has increased to reach a stable level both on hospital wards  out-patient clinics and in general practice. While the use of erythrocyte sedimentation rate on wards has decreased correspondingly  this is not seen in out-patient clinics or in general practice. There are medical as well as practical reasons for this discrepancy. It is believed that the possibility of performing a CRP as a point-of-care test in the GPs office in the future will lead to a reduction in the number of analyses of erythrocyte sedimentation rate performed in general practice as well.
Family Practice,,,[Cross-sectional therapeutic programs--an example of a cooperative health care system. A review with comments]. There is no tradition for sharing the responsibility for episodes of care between the primary and secondary sectors in the Danish health care system. Concurrently with increased international experience with shared care programmes  there is also a growing interest in Denmark in cooperation between the sectors. Based on literature research  shared care programmes are presented as a method of ensuring continuity and quality in treatment of chronic diseases. Experiences in the areas of diabetes  asthma  rheumatoid arthritis  and cancer are described. It is concluded that the Danish health care system is well prepared for the implementation of shared care programmes; there are only few sources of payment in the system  and an extensive continuing medical education system ensures that general practitioners can participate in relevant education. The implementation of shared care programmes in Denmark should be followed by scientific evaluation and documentation of the quality of the treatment programmes.
Family Practice,,,Evaluation of a near-patient test for C-reactive protein used in daily routine in primary healthcare by use of difference plots. We have assessed the technical performance and robustness of NycoCard CRP Whole Blood  a near-patient test for C-reactive protein (CRP)  when used in realistic daily routine situations in general practice clinics (GPC). Thirteen GPCs participated  five of them with technician staff. From 898 patients  split-sample measurements for CRP were made. Results from GPCs were compared with results from a turbidimetric laboratory method  traceable to international reference preparations (IFCC CRM 470). Results were evaluated in difference plots where the expected distribution  due to an estimated analytical variation  was compared with measured differences. Of all difference points  91.5% (n = 819) were within a 95% prediction interval based on the imprecision of both methods. Mean bias (95% confidence interval) was -0.3 mg/L (-0.9 to 0.3). No differences in analytic quality were found between GPCs with technician staffs and GPCs without  and between test results obtained within the first and second week  compared with the rest of the study period. We find the test as good when used in GPCs as could be expected from laboratory testing  and consequently robust  which is a necessity for use in routine situations in general practice. General application of difference plots in test evaluations are discussed in detail.
Family Practice,,,C-reactive protein in general practice--how commonly is it used and why? C-reactive protein (CRP) is a well-known diagnostic tool in general practice. The scope of this study was to assess how frequently CRP is used by general practitioners and to evaluate the reasons for using it. A retrospective part based on data from a laboratory database system  and a prospective part with a questionnaire-based registration. 30 general practice clinics in the catchment area of Vejle County Central Hospital. Retrospectively  all patients from general practice serviced by the laboratory for one year. Prospectively  1190 patients from whom a blood sample was taken for CRP-measurement during a 2 month study period. The frequency of using CRP and the reason requesting it; A) diagnosing a new disease  B) monitoring a well-known disease  or C) "screening". Furthermore; 1) infections  2) chronic inflammatory disease  3) malignant disease  or 4) others. CRP-measurements were ordered in 3.7% of all consultations in general practice and for 34.1% of all patients whose blood sample was analysed at the central laboratory. The use of CRP was as follows: A-1: 28.6%  A-2: 6.7%  A-3 4: 9.3%  B-1: 8.2%  B-2: 12.4%  B-3 4: 6.5%  C-1: 5.7%  C-2: 3.2%  C-3: 3.5% and C-4: 15.2%. Diagnosing a new (infectious) disease was the most frequent single reason for CRP-measurement. There was major interpractice variation. CRP is frequently used in general practice  mostly (65.4%) in the field of infections and chronic inflammatory diseases. Because of major interpractice variation  the most correct way of using CRP should be evaluated and guidelines should be provided.
Research Design,,,Stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor versus placebo in critically ill patients (SUP-ICU trial): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial. Critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) are at risk of clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding  and acid suppressants are frequently used prophylactically. However  stress ulcer prophylaxis may increase the risk of serious adverse events and  additionally  the quantity and quality of evidence supporting the use of stress ulcer prophylaxis is low. The aim of the SUP-ICU trial is to assess the benefits and harms of stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor in adult patients in the ICU. We hypothesise that stress ulcer prophylaxis reduces the rate of gastrointestinal bleeding  but increases rates of nosocomial infections and myocardial ischaemia. The overall effect on mortality is unpredictable. The SUP-ICU trial is an investigator-initiated  pragmatic  international  multicentre  randomised  blinded  parallel-group trial of stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor versus placebo (saline) in 3350 acutely ill ICU patients at risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. The primary outcome measure is 90-day mortality. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of patients with clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding  pneumonia  Clostridium difficile infection or myocardial ischaemia  days alive without life support in the 90-day period  serious adverse reactions  1-year mortality  and health economic analyses. The sample size will enable us to detect a 20 % relative risk difference (5 % absolute risk difference) in 90-day mortality assuming a 25 % event rate with a risk of type I error of 5 % and power of 90 %. The trial will be externally monitored according to Good Clinical Practice standards. Interim analyses will be performed after 1650 and 2500 patients. The SUP-ICU trial will provide high-quality data on the benefits and harms of stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor in critically ill adult patients admitted in the ICU.

Immunohistochemistry,,,The impact of langerin (CD207)+ dendritic cells and FOXP3+ Treg cells in the small bowel mucosa of children with celiac disease and atopic dermatitis in comparison to children with functional gastrointestinal disorders. In the present study we aimed to evaluate the impact of langerin (CD207)+ dendritic cells (DCs) and FOXP3+ Treg cells in the intestinal mucosa of children with celiac disease (CD) and atopic dermatitis (AD) in comparison to children with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGD). Seventy-five children (37 male  mean age 8.4 ± 4.8 years)  who randomly underwent small bowel biopsy  were studied. The CD was diagnosed in 14 children  including five persons with concomitant AD (all positive for anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA antibodies and with small bowel atrophy). Normal small bowel mucosa was found in eight patients with AD and in 53 patients with FGD. The sera of all patients were tested for total and specific IgE antibodies to food allergen panels. Staining for CD11c+  langerin (CD207+) DCs  CD4+  and FOXP3+ Treg cells was performed on paraffin-embedded sections of bioptates using immunohistochemistry. The density of CD11c+ DCs  CD4+  and FOXP3+ Treg cells was higher in the CD patients compared to the AD and FGD patients (p = 0.02; p = 0.001). In AD  significantly higher density of CD11c+ DCs was detected in patients positive for specific IgE to food allergen panels (p = 0.02). The FGD patients with elevated total IgE had increased density of langerin (CD207)+ DCs compared to the patients with normal total IgE levels (p = 0.01). The increased density of FOXP3+ Treg cells  CD4+  cells and CD11c+ DCs was associated with CD but not with AD. The elevated level of total IgE or specific IgE to food allergens was associated with more pronounced expression of DCs  indicating a possible link between the presence of these cells in small bowel mucosa with elevated level of serum IgE.
Otolaryngology,,,Noise exposure of care providers during otosurgical procedures. To monitor the noise exposure of care providers during otological surgery due to drilling and suction in the operating room. A clinical study monitoring different standard otosurgical procedures was conducted; cochlear implantation (CI)  mastotympanoplasty  and mastoidectomy alone. Noise exposure to the surgeon and assistant were monitored with wireless personal noise dosimetry and stationary sound monitoring. Both maximum peak level in dBC (Lpeak) and time-average sound pressure level in dBA (equivalent level or Leq) were measured during drilling episodes. Frequency analysis in one third octaves covering the frequency bands 6.3 Hz to 20 k Hz was performed using a sound analyzing program. When averaged over the entire procedure  the sound pressure level was highest for the surgeon and the assistant with values of 76.0 dBA and 72.5 dBA  respectively  during CI. Lpeak was 135.9 dBC. Leq for the stationary sound measurement was 74.2 dBA. During cortical bone work using a cutting burr  84.6 dBA was measured. Mean values of L95% (estimation of the background noise) were between 55.8 dBA and 61.2 dBA. Frequency analysis showed the highest sound pressure level for all procedures was between 2.5 kHz and 3.15 kHz. This is the first study to use personal sound dosimetry to monitor noise exposure during otosurgical drilling. In accordance with other studies  the results presented show sound levels below international occupational noise level regulations. However  the measured noise exposure during drilling could have negative effects on care providers based on unfavorable acoustical comfort.
Neurosurgery,,,Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination administered early after neurotrauma or neurosurgery. Pneumococcal vaccination is recommended to lower the risk of posttraumatic meningitis  and early vaccination may be of importance. After both trauma and central nervous system injury  immune-suppression may occur  which could affect T-cell function and the response to T-cell dependent vaccines. We therefore aimed to investigate the response to early vaccination with a T-cell independent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV). Thirty-three patients with basilar skull fracture and 23 patients undergoing transsphenoidal pituitary gland surgery were vaccinated with PPSV within 10days after neurotrauma or neurosurgery. Twenty-nine neurosurgical patients vaccinated ⩾3weeks after neurotrauma or neurosurgery served as controls. Serotype-specific anti-polysaccharide binding IgG antibody levels to serotypes 4  6B  9V  14  18C  19F and 23F were determined by enzyme immunoassay. The vaccination was safe and a highly significant antibody response was found against all serotypes in all groups (p<0.001 for each of the serotypes). There were no differences between groups or in the group by time interaction in any of the serotypes. After early and late vaccination  protective levels were found in >80% for serotypes 9V  14  18C  19F and 23F and in 70% and 50% for serotypes 6B and 4  respectively. Patients vaccinated with PPSV within 10days after neurotrauma or neurosurgery respond similarly to those vaccinated after ⩾3weeks  indicating that PPSV can be administered early after neurotrauma or neurosurgery. NCT02806284.
Anesthesiology,Clinical Competence,,Emergency airway access in children--transtracheal cannulas and tracheotomy assessed in a porcine model. In the rare scenario when it is impossible to oxygenate or intubate a child  no evidence exists on what strategy to follow. The aim of this study was to compare the time and success rate when using two different transtracheal needle techniques and also to measure the success rate and time when performing an emergency tracheotomy in a piglet cadaver model. In this randomized cross-over study  we included 32 anesthesiologists who each inserted two transtracheal cannulas (TTC) using a jet ventilation catheter and an intravenous catheter in a piglet model. Second  they performed an emergency tracheotomy. A maximum of 2 and 4 min were allowed for the procedures  respectively. The TTC procedures were recorded using a video scope. Placement of a transtracheal cannula was successful in 65.6% and 68.8% of the attempts (P = 0.76)  and the median duration of the attempts was 69 and 42 s (P = 0.32)  using the jet ventilation catheter and the intravenous catheter  respectively. Complications were frequent in both groups  especially perforation of the posterior tracheal wall. Performing an emergency tracheotomy was successful in 97%  in a median of 88 s. In a piglet model  we found no significant difference in success rates or time to insert a jet ventilation cannula or an intravenous catheter transtracheally  but the incidence of complications was high. In the same model  we found a 97% success rate for performing an emergency tracheotomy within 4 min with a low rate of complications.
Fiber Optic Technology,,,Cannot ventilate-cannot intubate an infant: surgical tracheotomy or transtracheal cannula? An unanticipated difficult airway is very uncommon in infants. The recommendations for managing the cannot ventilate-cannot intubate (CVCI) situation in infants and small children are based on difficult airway algorithms for adults. These algorithms usually recommend placement of a transtracheal cannula or performing a surgical tracheotomy as a last resort. In this study  we compared the success rate and time used for inserting a transtracheal cannula vs performing a modified surgical tracheotomy in a piglet model. We used 10 three-week-old euthanized piglets  weighing eight kilograms each. Thirty physicians had a timed attempt of inserting a transtracheal cannula for jet ventilation. A maximum time of 120 s was allowed. Ten physicians had a timed attempt of performing a modified surgical tracheotomy after a short introduction by an ENT surgeon. The allowed time for this procedure was 240 s. Placement of the transtracheal cannula was successful for eight of 30 physicians. Median time for successful insertion was 68 s. Surgical tracheotomy was successful for 8 of 10 physicians. Median time for successful tracheotomy was 89 s. There was a significantly higher success rate for surgical tracheotomy (P = 0.007). We found placement of a transtracheal cannula to be significantly less successful than the modified surgical tracheotomy in a piglet model. We question whether placement of a transtracheal cannula should be recommended in infants in a cannot ventilate-cannot intubate situation.
Fiber Optic Technology,,,Using a nasopharyngeal airway during fiberoptic intubation in small children with a difficult airway. Induction of anesthesia and tracheal intubation in small children with a difficult airway is a challenging task. We report the experience with a procedure based on sevoflurane inhalation via a nasopharyngeal airway inserted early during induction before airway obstruction occurs. A pediatric fiberscope is used to perform a nasotracheal intubation via the opposite nostril. All small children with suspected or known difficult airway needing tracheal intubation were scheduled for a fiberoptic intubation following the described protocol. In 3 years  we performed 27 successful fiberoptic guided tracheal intubations in 19 children  median age 8.2 months (1.0-39.1 months) and median weight 7.6 kg (3.0-15.0 kg). The optimal depth for placement of the nasopharyngeal airway was found to be 8.0 cm (7.0-8.5 cm) from the nostril in the first year of life and 8.5 cm (8.0-10 cm) in the second year. Oxygenation was sufficient during the entire procedure in all cases except one child who had short-lasting laryngeal spasm caused by instillation of lidocaine during light anesthesia. The duration of fiberoptic intubation was significantly shorter when performed by an experienced anesthesiologist (55 s vs. 120 s)  but there was no significant correlation between the duration of fiberoscopy and oxygen saturation during fiberoscopy or endtidal CO(2) after intubation. The combination of nasopharyngeal airway and fiberoptic guided tracheal intubation seems to be a reliable and safe procedure for managing the difficult airway in small children.
Orthopedics,,,[Time consumption at an orthopedic operating theatre. Physicians' ability to predict their own time consumption]. The aim of the study was to investigate the time spent on different procedures in an orthopaedic operating theatre  and to evaluate the ability of doctors to predict their own time consumption. Time schedules were registered for 146 operations  of these 104 were either knee or hip replacements. Sixty percent of the total time was spent on surgery. The median misjudgment was 15 minutes for surgeons and five minutes for anaesthetists. An improvement in the doctors' ability to predict their own time consumption in the course of the study period could not be demonstrated. Comparing the study period with the similar period the year before it was not possible to demonstrate a change in the number of cancelled operations or the number of days with overtime. Epidural anaesthesia with bupivacaine was the most time consuming anaesthesia  the differences between the other forms of anaesthesia used were insignificant.
Clinical Competence,Education  Medical  Undergraduate,Pediatrics,[Pre-graduate training program in interviewing children in pediatric departments at the Rigshospitalet and Amager Hospital]. The study describes a training program in interviewing children at the Departments of Pediatrics  Copenhagen University Hospital  Rigshospitalet and Amager Hospital  Faculty of Health  University of Copenhagen and evaluates the training sessions. The students' self-assessment ratings were summarized and compared using Mann-Whitney U test. Most students rated their learning outcome in interviewing children high. In conclusion  training of medical students in interviewing skills in a clinical department of pediatrics is feasible  although time consuming.
Epidemiology,,,Prevalence of neuropathic pain according to the IASP grading system in patients with chronic non-malignant pain. The primary objective was to determine the prevalence of neuropathic pain according to the new International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) grading system. The secondary objective was to compare the system classification of neuropathic pain with the classification of neuropathic pain according to a patient-administered screening questionnaire. A Multidisciplinary Pain Center. One hundred twenty patients with a variety of chronic pain conditions referred to a multidisciplinary pain center. Consecutively referred patients filled out the PainDETECT Questionnaire before the first consultation. During the first consultation  patients had pain history taken and bedside examination performed by a pain specialist. Patients were classified according to the score on the PainDETECT Questionnaire and graded according to the IASP grading system about the certainty of neuropathic pain. According to the IASP grading system  22 patients (18.3%) classified as probable or definite neuropathic pain and 90 patients (75%) as unlikely neuropathic pain. According to the PainDETECT Questionnaire  55 patients (45%) were classified as likely neuropathic pain and 13 patients (10.8%) as unlikely neuropathic pain. Eleven patients (20%) who were classified as neuropathic pain according to PainDETECT were also classified as probable or definite neuropathic pain by the new IASP grading system. According to the new IASP grading system  less than 20% of the patients referred to a multidisciplinary pain center fulfilled the criteria for neuropathic pain. The classification of neuropathic pain with the IASP system varies from the classification of neuropathic pain with the use of a self-administered screening questionnaire.
Biology,Physiology,,IUD (Nova-T) insertion following induced abortion. In a prospective study  86 women who had an IUD (Nova-T) inserted immediately after induced abortion were compared to 95 abortion patients who started another contraception (control I). Additionally  the rate of complications following IUD insertion in a Family Planning Clinic (control II) were studied in 83 non-pregnant women. The overall infection rate for post-abortion patients was 4.4% (5.8% in the study group  3.2% in control I). No infections were observed in control group II. Confidence limits (95%) for the three groups were overlapping. Among the women in the study group  bleeding and pain were not more frequent  but if one of these complications occurred  it tended to be more serious and the duration was longer. The number of days before resumption of work after abortion was 3-4 days in both abortion groups. After three months  the continuation rate was 83% (71 of 86) in the study group  76% (72 of 95) in control I and 93% (77 of 83) in control II. Sixty-nine of the 181 women admitted for legal abortion had been admitted for the same reason previously. In this study  the recurrence rate after 12 months was 0% in the study group and 4.2% (4 of 95) in control group I. The insertion of an IUD at the time of abortion seems to be an effective and acceptable solution to the problem of recurrent abortion.
Dermatology,Education  Medical,Educational Measurement,The effect of two grading systems on the performance of medical students during oral examinations. Either a pass/fail approach or a seven-point grading scale are used to evaluate students at the Danish universities. The aim of this study was to explore any effect of the assessment methods on student performances during oral exams. In a prospective study including 1 037 examinations in three medical subjects  we investigated the difference in the test scores between the spring- and autumn semester. In the spring semester  the students could either pass or fail the subject (pass/fail) while in the following autumn semester  the students were assessed by tiered grading (seven-point grading scale). Unknown to the students  the examiners assessed the students by the seven-point grading scale also in the spring semester. Students at the international classes who were officially assessed by the seven-point grading scale during both semesters served as control group. The grading scores were significantly higher among students who were aware of being evaluated with the seven-point grading scores compared with the pass/fail group (p < 0.0001). In comparison  no significant difference between the exam results was observed from the spring- to the autumn semester for the control group (p = 0.45). Moreover  the average mark was higher among the international students (mean = 10.3  on the seven-point grading scale) than in the Danish speaking classes (mean = 9.1). The seven-point grading scale seems to motivate students to yield a better performance; hence tiered-grading should probably be preferred to a simple pass/fail approach. none. not relevant.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Conjunctival Lymphoma--An International Multicenter Retrospective Study. To date  the clinical features of the various subtypes of conjunctival lymphoma (CL) have not been previously evaluated in a large cohort. To characterize subtype-specific clinical features of CL and their effect on patient outcome. A retrospective multicenter study was performed. Patient data were collected from January 1  1980  through December 31  2010. The dates of the analysis were May 15  2015  to August 20  2015. The median follow-up period was 43 months. Seven eye cancer centers were involved in the study. In total  268 patients with CL were identified  5 of whom were excluded because of missing clinical data. Overall survival  disease-specific survival  and progression-free survival were the primary end points. Two hundred sixty-three patients with CL were included in the study. Their mean age was 61.3 years  and 55.1% (145 of 263) were female. All lymphomas were of B-cell type. The most frequent subtype was extranodal marginal zone lymphoma (EMZL) (68.4% [180 of 263])  followed by follicular lymphoma (FL) (16.3% [43 of 263])  mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) (6.8% [18 of 263])  and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (4.6% [12 of 263). Conjunctival lymphoma commonly manifested in elderly individuals (age range  60-70 years old)  with EMZL having a female predilection (57.8% [104 of 180]) and MCL having a marked male predominance (77.8% [14 of 18]). Unlike EMZL and FL  DLBCL and MCL were frequently secondary diseases (41.7% [5 of 12] and 88.9% [16 of 18]  respectively)  with MCL showing a frequent occurrence of stage IVE lymphoma (61.1% [11 of 18]) and bilateral manifestation (77.8% [14 of 18]). Localized disease (stage IE or IIE) was commonly treated with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) with or without chemotherapy  while widespread lymphoma (stage IIIE or IVE) and MCL of any stage were managed with chemotherapy with or without EBRT. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and MCL had a poor prognosis  with 5-year disease-specific survival of 55.0% and 9.0%  respectively  in contrast to EMZL (97.0%) and FL (82.0%). Further survival predictors included age (EMZL)  sex (FL)  and Ann Arbor staging classification (EMZL and FL). The American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM staging showed limited prognostic usefulness  only being able to predict survival for patients with DLBCL. Conjunctival lymphoma consists of mainly 4 subtypes of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma: EMZL  FL  MCL  and DLBCL. Mantle cell lymphoma is characterized by a particularly high frequency of secondary disease of stage IVE and bilateral manifestation. The histological subtype is the main outcome predictor  with MCL and DLBCL having a markedly poorer prognosis than EMZL and FL.
Anesthesiology,Clinical Competence,Education  Medical  Graduate,[Checklist for training and evaluation of consultants can work in a clinical setting]. Formalised educational programmes for consultants are uncommon in Denmark. Our objective was to introduce a checklist for training and formative evaluation for consultants to see if this was a feasible method. Sixteen anaesthesiologists participated. A checklist for the use of a difficult airway device was developed. The consultants observed an experienced colleague use the device and then did the procedure themselves supervised in the clinical setting  and finally taught a fellow consultant how to do the procedure. Afterwards they were interviewed about the training method. Checklists seem a promising method for consultants and may be applied in the future.
Pharmacogenetics,,,Lack of genetic association between OCT1  ABCB1  and UGT2B7 variants and morphine pharmacokinetics. A high inter-individual variation in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of morphine has been observed. Genetic polymorphisms in genes encoding the organic cation transporter isoform 1 (OCT1)  the efflux transporter p-glycoprotein (ABCB1)  and the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-2B7 (UGT2B7) may influence morphine pharmacokinetics and thus  also pharmacodynamics. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between OCT1  ABCB1  and UGT2B7 variants  and morphine pharmacokinetics and -dynamics in healthy volunteers. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data were collected from a double-blinded  randomized  crossover trial in 37 healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic data were analyzed in NONMEM®  and the time-concentration relationship of morphine  morphine-3-glucuronide  and morphine-6-glucuronide was parameterized as the transit compartment rate constant (ktr)  clearance (CL)  and volume of distribution (VD). The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-150min) and the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) were also calculated. Pharmacodynamic data were measured as pain tolerance thresholds to mechanical stimulation of the rectum and muscle  as well as tonic cold pain stimulation ("the cold pressor test" where hand was immersed in cold water). Six different single nucleotide polymorphisms in three different genes (OCT1 (n=22)  ABCB1 (n=37)  and UGT2B (n=22)) were examined. Neither AUC0-150min  ktr  CL  nor VD were associated with genetic variants in OCT1  ABCB1  and UGT2B7 (all P>0.05). Similarly  the antinociceptive effects of morphine on rectal  muscle  and cold pressor tests were not associated with these genetic variants (all P>0.05). In this experimental study in healthy volunteers  we found no association between different genotypes of OCT1  ABCB1  and UGT2B7  and morphine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Nonetheless  due to methodological limitations we cannot exclude that associations exist.
Pharmacoepidemiology,,,Generic switching of warfarin and risk of excessive anticoagulation: a Danish nationwide cohort study. Generic switching of warfarin was recently repealed in Denmark  as adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports suggested risk of excessive anticoagulation following switches from branded to generic warfarin. We investigated this putative association in a formalized pharmacoepidemiological analysis. We conducted a nationwide cohort study based on Danish healthcare registries  including data from the introduction of generic warfarin until the repeal (January 2011-April 2015). We followed Danish warfarin users over time and compared the rate of incident hospitalizations due to excessive anticoagulation (i.e. increased INR or any bleeding requiring hospitalization) in periods following a recent switch to generic warfarin to the rate in periods without a recent switch. We included 105 751 warfarin users  filling a total of 1 539 640 prescriptions for warfarin (2.5% for generic warfarin). This constituted 89.0% of all warfarin prescriptions in Denmark during the study period. We observed 19 362 switches to generic warfarin during the study period. The adjusted hazard ratio for excessive anticoagulation following a recent switch from branded to generic warfarin was 1.1 (95%CI  0.8-1.4). The result was robust within subgroups and several sensitivity analyses. Switching from branded to generic warfarin is not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization with excessive anticoagulation. However  a minor excess risk of transient INR increase cannot be excluded. Pharmacoepidemiological studies provide an effective method for swift evaluation of hypotheses generated by ADR-reports.
Proteomics,,,Useful Web Resources. An increasing number of web resources are available for aiding in proteomics research. Databases contain repositories of proteins and associated information. A recent article by Chen et al. (Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 13(1):36-39  2015) evaluates a number of MS-based proteomics repositories containing MS and expression data  including repositories devoted to cataloguing high confidence post-translational modifications. Many sites have tools developed by research labs that are shared with the community and online tutorials and videos for learning how to use the tools. This chapter contains a selection of web sites useful for proteomics analyses but is by no means comprehensive. Using a search engine such as Google is the easiest way to find the sites using the name given below.
Health Education,Qualitative Research,Schools,Increasing the reach: Involving local Muslim religious teachers in a behavioral intervention to eliminate urogenital schistosomiasis in Zanzibar. In Zanzibar  United Republic of Tanzania  Madrassa schools are influential institutions  where children and adults can learn about the interpretation of the Koran. We aimed to explore the involvement of Madrassa teachers for behavior change interventions in a randomized operational research trial designed to investigate the impact of multiple approaches to eliminate urogenital schistosomiasis transmission from Zanzibar. Madrassa teachers performing in the 30 communities of the behavior change study arm were trained in new interactive and participatory teaching methods by the local behavioral team and provided with schistosomiasis-teaching tools for teaching about transmission and prevention in their Madrassa. In July 2014  in a qualitative research study  we conducted 25 semi-structured interviews with Madrassa teachers to find out how they perceived their involvement in interventions against schistosomiasis. In 2014  5926 among the 8497 registered Madrassa students in 30 communities on Unguja and Pemba islands received health education and participated in interactive behavior change exercises about schistosomiasis. Madrassa teachers reported that they valued their inclusion in the study and the opportunity to educate their students about schistosomiasis transmission  prevention  and treatment. They also perceived personal and community benefits as a result of their training and strongly supported the inclusion of additional Madrassa teachers in future intervention activities. Madrassa teachers are influential in the Zanzibari society  and hence are important change agents within our community-level behavioral intervention. They might constitute an untapped resource that can help to expand and increase acceptance of and participation in schistosomiasis and other neglected tropical disease control activities in African Muslim communities.
Research,,,Health systems in the Republic of Congo: challenges and opportunities for implementing tuberculosis and HIV collaborative service  research  and training activities. The Republic of Congo is on the World Health Organization (WHO) list of 'high burden' countries for tuberculosis (TB) and HIV. TB is the leading cause of death among HIV-infected patients in the Republic of Congo. In this viewpoint  the available data on TB and HIV in the Republic of Congo are reviewed  and the gaps and bottlenecks that the National TB Control Program (NTCP) faces are discussed. Furthermore  priority requirements for developing and implementing TB and HIV collaborative service activities are identified. HIV and TB control programs operate as distinct entities with separate case management plans. The implementation of collaborative TB/HIV activities to evaluate and monitor the management of TB/HIV co-infected individuals remains inefficient in most regions  and these activities are sometimes non-existent. This reveals major challenges that require definition in order to improve the delivery of healthcare. The NTCP lacks adequate resources for optimal implementation of control measures of TB and HIV compliance and outcomes. The importance of aligning and integrating TB and HIV treatment services (including follow-up) and adherence support services through coordinated and collaborative efforts between individual TB and HIV programs is discussed. Aligning and integrating TB and HIV treatment services through coordinated and collaborative efforts between individual TB and HIV programs is required. However  the WHO recommendations are generic  and health services in the Republic of Congo need to tailor their TB and HIV programs according to the availability of resources and operational feasibility. This will also open opportunities for synergizing collaborative TB/HIV research and training activities  which should be prioritized by the donors supporting the TB/HIV programs.
Rehabilitation,,,A randomized  controlled trial of a multi-modal exercise intervention in Huntington's disease. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and benefit of a structured exercise intervention in people with Huntington's Disease (HD). This study was conducted at 6 sites  and participants were randomized into either exercise or control (usual care) groups  and were assessed at baseline  13 and 26 weeks. The intervention was a 12 week  three times per week progressive exercise program  including aerobic (stationary cycling) and upper and lower body strengthening exercise with tapered 1:1 support for 20 of 36 sessions. 314 adults were assessed for eligibility: 248 did not meet inclusion criteria  34 declined  and 32 were recruited and randomized. Three individuals in the intervention group were withdrawn within the first month due to concomitant medical conditions  resulting in 14 participants in intervention and 15 in control groups. There were two AEs in the intervention group  both related to previous medical conditions  and there were two SAEs  both in the control group. The intervention group had better fitness (predicted VO2 max difference: 492.3 ml min(-1)  95% CI: [97.1  887.6])  lower UHDRS mMS (difference 2.9 points  95% [-5.42  -0.32]) and lower weight at Week 13 (difference 2.25 kg  95% CI: [-4.47  -0.03]). This study demonstrates that a short-term exercise intervention is safe and feasible. Individuals with HD may benefit from structured exercise  and intensity  monitoring and support may be key factors in optimizing response. Larger scale trials are now required to fully elucidate the extended clinical potential of exercise in HD. Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN11392629.
Qualitative Research,,,Family caregivers' accounts of caring for a family member with motor neurone disease in Norway: a qualitative study. Motor neurone disease (MND) is a progressive neurological disease causing muscle wasting  gradual paralysis  respiratory failure. MND care is demanding  complex and involves a variety of care tasks. Family members may experience significant and enduring strain. We conducted a qualitative study to understand more about family caregivers' work and sense of responsibility  exploring family caregivers' accounts of caring for a family member with MND. We recruited and interviewed a total of 25 participants from Norway  including 17 current and eight bereaved family caregivers. Drawing on theories of care by Corbin and Strauss  we analysed the data by a theoretical reading of the material to identify different types of care work. We found that caregivers were engaged in five lines of care work that could be parallel or closely interconnected: i) immediate care work; ii) seeking information and clarity about the disease; iii) managing competing obligations; iv) maintaining normality; and v) managing external resources and assistance. Caregivers' priorities were shaped by their interactions with the person with MND  available assistive devices  the development of the illness  and utilisation of paid care. Care work had a symbolic and moral meaning for caregivers  and was associated with self-worth and respect from others. Caregivers tried to balance their own expectations and others' expectations without being overwhelmed by care work. A changing and potentially chaotic situation for family caregivers may compromise their capacity to utilise supportive services. Using the lines of work as a framework to assess caregivers' preferences and priorities  health professionals may tailor assistance and support to family members caring for persons with MND.
Qualitative Research,,,What is a medical decision? A taxonomy based on physician statements in hospital encounters: a qualitative study. The medical literature lacks a comprehensive taxonomy of decisions made by physicians in medical encounters. Such a taxonomy might be useful in understanding the physician-centred  patient-centred and shared decision-making in clinical settings. We aimed to identify and classify all decisions emerging in conversations between patients and physicians. Qualitative study of video recorded patient-physician encounters. 380 patients in consultations with 59 physicians from 17 clinical specialties and three different settings (emergency room  ward round  outpatient clinic) in a Norwegian teaching hospital. A randomised sample of 30 encounters from internal medicine was used to identify and classify decisions  a maximum variation sample of 20 encounters was used for reliability assessments  and the remaining encounters were analysed to test for applicability across specialties. On the basis of physician statements in our material  we developed a taxonomy of clinical decisions--the Decision Identification and Classification Taxonomy for Use in Medicine (DICTUM). We categorised decisions into 10 mutually exclusive categories: gathering additional information  evaluating test results  defining problem  drug-related  therapeutic procedure-related  legal and insurance-related  contact-related  advice and precaution  treatment goal  and deferment. Four-coder inter-rater reliability using Krippendorff's α was 0.79. DICTUM represents a precise  detailed and comprehensive taxonomy of medical decisions communicated within patient-physician encounters. Compared to previous normative frameworks  the taxonomy is descriptive  substantially broader and offers new categories to the variety of clinical decisions. The taxonomy could prove helpful in studies on the quality of medical work  use of time and resources  and understanding of why  when and how patients are or are not involved in decisions.
Genomics,,,Pediatric  Adolescent  and Young Adult Thyroid Carcinoma Harbors Frequent and Diverse Targetable Genomic Alterations  Including Kinase Fusions. Thyroid carcinoma  which is rare in pediatric patients (age 0-18 years) but more common in adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients (age 15-39 years)  carries the potential for morbidity and mortality. Hybrid-capture-based comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) was performed prospectively on 512 consecutively submitted thyroid carcinomas  including 58 from pediatric and AYA (PAYA) patients  to identify genomic alterations (GAs)  including base substitutions  insertions/deletions  copy number alterations  and rearrangements. This PAYA data series includes 41 patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC)  3 with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC)  and 14 with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). GAs were detected in 93% (54/58) of PAYA cases  with a mean of 1.4 GAs per case. In addition to BRAF V600E mutations  detected in 46% (19/41) of PAYA PTC cases and in 1 of 3 AYA ATC cases  oncogenic fusions involving RET  NTRK1  NTRK3  and ALK were detected in 37% (15/41) of PAYA PTC and 33% (1/3) of AYA ATC cases. Ninety-three percent (13/14) of MTC patients harbored RET alterations  including 3 novel insertions/deletions in exons 6 and 11. Two of these MTC patients with novel alterations in RET experienced clinical benefit from vandetanib treatment. CGP identified diverse clinically relevant GAs in PAYA patients with thyroid carcinoma  including 83% (34/41) of PTC cases harboring activating kinase mutations or activating kinase rearrangements. These genomic observations and index cases exhibiting clinical benefit from targeted therapy suggest that young patients with advanced thyroid carcinoma can benefit from CGP and rationally matched targeted therapy. The Oncologist 2017;22:255-263 IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The detection of diverse clinically relevant genomic alterations in the majority of pediatric  adolescent  and young adult patients with thyroid carcinoma in this study suggests that comprehensive genomic profiling may be beneficial for young patients with papillary  anaplastic  or medullary thyroid carcinoma  particularly for advanced or refractory cases for which clinical trials involving molecularly targeted therapies may be appropriate.
Nanotechnology,Proteomics,,ApoA-I/HDL-C levels are inversely associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm progression. Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) evolution is unpredictable  and there is no therapy except surgery for patients with an aortic size> 5 cm (large AAA). We aimed to identify new potential biomarkers that could facilitate prognosis and treatment of patients with AAA. A differential quantitative proteomic analysis of plasma proteins was performed in AAA patients at different stages of evolution [small AAA (aortic size=3-5 cm) vs large AAA] using iTRAQ labelling  high-throughput nano-LC-MS/MS and a novel multi-layered statistical model. Among the proteins identified  ApoA-I was decreased in patients with large AAA compared to those with small AAA. These results were validated by ELISA on plasma samples from small (n=90) and large AAA (n=26) patients (150± 3 vs 133± 5 mg/dl  respectively  p< 0.001). ApoA-I levels strongly correlated with HDL-Cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration (r=0.9  p< 0.001) and showed a negative correlation with aortic size (r=-0.4  p< 0.01) and thrombus volume (r=-0.3  p< 0.01)  which remained significant after adjusting for traditional risk factors. In a prospective study  HDL-C independently predicted aneurysmal growth rate in multiple linear regression analysis (n=122  p=0.008) and was inversely associated with need for surgical repair (Adjusted hazard ratio: 0.18  95 % confidence interval: 0.04-0.74  p=0.018). In a nation-wide Danish registry  we found lower mean HDL-C concentration in large AAA patients (n=6 560) compared with patients with aorto-iliac occlusive disease (n=23 496) (0.89± 2.99 vs 1.59± 5.74 mmol/l  p< 0.001). Finally  reduced mean aortic AAA diameter was observed in AngII-infused mice treated with ApoA-I mimetic peptide compared with saline-injected controls. In conclusion  ApoA-I/HDL-C systemic levels are negatively associated with AAA evolution. Therapies targeting HDL functionality could halt AAA formation.
Water Microbiology,,,Long-term monitoring of molecular markers can distinguish different seasonal patterns of fecal indicating bacteria sources. Elevated levels of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) have been observed at Topanga Beach  CA  USA. To identify the FIB sources  a microbial source tracking study using a dog-  a gull- and two human-associated molecular markers was conducted at 10 sites over 21 months. Historical data suggest that episodic discharge from the lagoon at the mouth of Topanga Creek is the main source of bacteria to the beach. A decline in creek FIB/markers downstream from upper watershed development and a sharp increase in FIB/markers at the lagoon sites suggest sources are local to the lagoon. At the lagoon and beach  human markers are detected sporadically  dog marker peaks in abundance mid-winter  and gull marker is chronically elevated. Varied seasonal patterns of FIB and source markers were identified showing the importance of applying a suite of markers over long-term spatial and temporal sampling to identify a complex combination of sources of contamination.
Qualitative Research,,,Latino parents' perspectives on barriers to autism diagnosis. Latino children are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) at older ages and at the point of more severe symptoms. We sought to qualitatively describe community  family  and health care system barriers to ASD diagnosis in Latino children. Five focus groups and 4 qualitative interviews were conducted with 33 parents of Latino children previously diagnosed with an ASD. Participants described Latino community perceptions of autism and barriers they experienced during the diagnostic process. Sessions were audiorecorded and transcribed. Transcripts were coded by 2 researchers  and data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Parents reported low levels of ASD information and high levels of mental health and disability stigma in the Latino community. Parents had poor access to care as a result of poverty  limited English proficiency  and lack of empowerment to take advantage of services. Providers sometimes dismissed parents' concerns. The ASD diagnostic process itself was slow  inconvenient  confusing  and uncomfortable for the child. These factors led many parents to normalize their child's early behaviors  deny that a problem existed  and lose trust in the medical system. Additional educational outreach to Latino families  destigmatization of ASD  streamlining the ASD diagnostic process  and providing additional support to Latino parents of at-risk children may decrease delays in ASD diagnosis among Latino children.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Immunohistochemical alterations in invasive adenocarcinoma in endoscopically resected adenoma and factors associated with risk of residual or recurrent disease. We determined the pattern of immunohistochemical expression in invasive adenocarcinoma in endoscopically resected adenoma  its relationship with the risk of residual or recurrent disease and the related factors. We included individuals with malignant polyps resected endoscopically in the period 1999-2009. Clinical and endoscopic data were collected. All histological specimens were re-analysed. CD44  matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9)  vascular endothelial growth factor-β (VEGF-β)  β-catenin  laminin and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) expression were determined by immunohistochemistry. A multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine variables independently associated with the risk of residual or recurrent disease. One-hundred and fifty-one malignant polyps (114 pedunculated; mean size ± SD=22.61 ± 10.86 mm) were resected endoscopically. Resection was fragmented and incomplete in 26.5% and 8.6% of patients  respectively. Surgical resection was performed on 71 (47%) patients. After a median follow-up of 44 months  residual (n=12) or recurrent (n=6) disease was detected in 17 patients. Conventional histology showed that 32.1% met high-risk histological criteria. Immunohistochemical expression was positive for CD44  MMP-9  VEGF-β  β-catenin  laminin and COX-2 in 63.3%  25.3%  45%  38.8%  79% and 34.5% of specimens  respectively  with no differences between both groups. Variables associated with residual or recurrent disease in the univariate analysis were: nonpedunculated morphology (P=0.07); fragmented (P<0.001) or incomplete resection (P<0.001); margin infiltration (P=0.04); and histological high-risk lesion (P=0.003). Finally  incomplete resection (OR=12.16  95% CI=3.15-46.98; P<0.001) and histological high risk (OR=4.73  95% CI=1.33-16.74; P=0.002) were independently associated with the risk of residual or recurrent disease. Immunohistochemistry could not predict residual or recurrent disease. Only incomplete excision and histological high risk did so. The factors independently associated were histological high-risk lesion and incomplete resection.
Electrochemistry,,,A neutral zwitterionic molecular solid. We report on the acid ethylenedithiotetrathiafulvaleneamidoglycine (EDT-TTF-CO-NH-CH(2)-CO(2)H; 1; EDT-TTF=ethylenedithiotetrathiafulvalene) and the 1:1 adduct [(EDT-TTF)(·+)-CO-NH-CH(2)-(CO(2))(-)][(EDT-TTF)-CO-NH-CH(2)-(CO(2)H)]·CH(3)OH (2)  a new type of hydrogen-bonded  1:1 acid/zwitterion hybrid embrace of redox peptidics into a two-dimensional architecture  an example of a system deliberately fashioned so that oxidation of π-conjugated cores toward the radical-cation form would interfere with the activity of the appended ionizable residues in the presence of a templating base during crystal growth. First-principles calculations demonstrate that  notwithstanding preconceived ideas  a metallic state is more stable than the hole-localized alternatives for a neat 1:1 neutral acid/zwitterion hybrid. The inhomogeneous Coulomb field associated with proton-shared  interstacks O-H···O hydrogen bonds between the ionizable residues distributed on both sides of the two-dimensional π-conjugated framework leads  however  to a weak hole localization responsible for the activated but high conductivity of 1 S cm(-1). This situation is reminiscent of the role of the environment on electron transfer in tetraheme cytochrome c  in which the protonation state of a heme propionate becomes paramount  or ion-gated transport phenomena in biology. These observations open rather intriguing opportunities for the construction of electronic systems at the interface of chemistry and biology.
Radiation Oncology,,,American College of Radiology (ACR) Radiation Oncology Practice Accreditation: A pattern of change. The American College of Radiology (ACR) Radiation Oncology Practice Accreditation (ROPA) program has accredited more than 600 sites since 2006  including practices within academic  hospital-based  and freestanding settings. The purpose of this report is to evaluate and compare patterns of change in common deficiencies over time. The ACR database was queried to analyze the common deficiencies noted by the ACR ROPA program between 2012 and 2014. Deficiencies were ranked and compared to the top 10 items that were reported in 2006. Between 2012 and 2014  272 new applications and 306 renewals were received. Timely verification of port films  documentation of physician peer review  inclusion of essential elements of a treatment prescription  evidence of a final physicist chart review  documentation of weekly treatment visits  and inclusion of key elements of brachytherapy documentation all improved when compared with 2000-2005. Deficiencies ranked higher on the current review compared with the previous analysis included documentation of a robust quality assurance program  missing elements from the history and physical documentation  and documentation of follow-up visits. Our analysis of changes in patterns of deficiencies across radiation oncology practices reflects changes in our field such as the growing reliance on electronic records and imaging. Accreditation continues to play an integral role in establishing national standards and a nonpunitive  peer-reviewed method to evaluate a practice's compliance with national quality guidelines.
Anatomy,,,Medial patellotibial ligament and medial patellomeniscal ligament: anatomy  imaging  biomechanics  and clinical review. The purpose of this article is to review anatomical  biomechanical  and clinical data of the medial patellotibial ligament (MPTL) and medial patellomeniscal ligament (MPML)  as well as studies focusing on the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) but with relevant data about the MPTL and MPML. A literature search of articles specifically addressing the MPTL and/or MPML was included along with studies focusing on the MPFL but with relevant data about the MPTL and MPML. The medial patellar ligaments responsible for maintaining the stability of the patellofemoral (PF) joint include the MPFL  the MPTL  and the MPML. The MPFL is considered the primary restraint to lateral patellar translation  while the latter two are considered secondary restraints. There is robust literature on the anatomical  imaging  and biomechanical characteristics of the MPFL  and also the clinical outcome of its injury and surgical reconstruction; much less is known about the MPTL and MPML. Isolated MPFL reconstruction has good clinical and functional outcomes  with a low failure rate when defined as frank re-dislocation. Complications  including continued episodes of patellar apprehension and subluxation  remain present in most series. In addition  the current literature primarily includes a homogeneous population with few excessive anatomic dysplastic factors. There is lack of knowledge on the role of MPTL and MPML in (potentially) aiding patella stabilization and improving clinical outcomes. Understanding the role of the medial-sided patellar ligaments  in particular the role of the secondary stabilizers  in PF function and injury will aid in this goal. MPTL and MPML have consistent basic science literature  as well as favorable clinical outcomes of surgical patellar stabilization with reconstruction of the MPTL. However  there is much heterogeneity among clinical case series and lack of comparative studies to allow clear indication for the role of isolated or combined surgical reconstruction in patellar stabilization. Therefore  this comprehensive review helps understand the current knowledge and the possible applications in the orthopedic clinical practice. V.
Research Design,,,Detailed statistical analysis plan for the Danish Palliative Care Trial (DanPaCT). Advanced cancer patients experience considerable symptoms  problems  and needs. Early referral of these patients to specialized palliative care (SPC) could offer improvements. The Danish Palliative Care Trial (DanPaCT) investigates whether patients with metastatic cancer will benefit from being referred to 'early SPC'. DanPaCT is a multicenter  parallel-group  superiority clinical trial with 1:1 randomization. The planned sample size was 300 patients. The primary data collection for DanPaCT is finished. To prevent outcome reporting bias  selective reporting  and data-driven results  we present a detailed statistical analysis plan (SAP) for DanPaCT here. This SAP provides detailed descriptions of the statistical analyses of the primary and secondary outcomes in DanPaCT. The primary outcome is the change in the patient's 'primary need'. The 'primary need' is a patient-individualised outcome representing the score of the symptom or problem that had the highest intensity out of seven at baseline assessed with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). Secondary outcomes are the seven scales that are represented in the primary outcome  but each scale evaluated individually for all patients  and survival. The detailed description includes chosen significance levels  models for multiple imputations  sensitivity analyses and blinding. In addition  we discuss the patient-individualized primary outcome  blinding  missing data  multiplicity and the risk of bias. Only few trials have investigated the effects of SPC. To our knowledge DanPaCT is the first trial to investigate screening based 'early SPC' for patients with metastatic cancer from a broad spectrum of cancer diagnosis. Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01348048 (May 2011).
Rheology,,,Measurement of plasma viscosity by free oscillation rheometry: imprecision  sample stability and establishment of a new reference range. Plasma viscosity (PV) is used in the investigation of hyperviscosity syndrome. We have evaluated the performance of a new bench-top free oscillation rheometer  ReoRox from Medirox  and established a new reference range. Performance of the free oscillation rheometry (FOR) method was evaluated examining within-run and between-run imprecision  duration of measurement and operator simplicity. Furthermore  influence of storage on the PV measurements was assessed and a reference range based on plasma from 585 healthy men and women was established. Imprecision of the free oscillation rheometer was comparable to other viscometers and performance of the instrument was satisfying. The non-parametrical reference range established was 1.22-1.44 mPa s at 37℃ (2.5th and 97.5th percentiles). We have established a FOR PV reference range to support clinical decision-making. Furthermore  we found high pre-analytical stability of the samples and an analytical imprecision comparable to other PV methods.
Computational Biology,Immunohistochemistry,,Expression of osteoblast and osteoclast regulatory genes in the bone marrow microenvironment in multiple myeloma: only up-regulation of Wnt inhibitors SFRP3 and DKK1 is associated with lytic bone disease. Multiple myeloma (MM) lytic bone disease (LBD) is caused by osteoclast activation and osteoblast inhibition. RANK/RANKL/OPG play central roles in osteoclast activation and Wnt inhibitor DKK1 in osteoblast inhibition. The role of other Wnt inhibitors is less clear. We evaluated gene expression of osteoclast regulators (RANK  RANKL  OPG  TRAIL  MIP1A)  Wnt inhibitors (DKK1  SFRP2  SFRP3  sclerostin  WIF1) and osteoblast transcription factors (RUNX2  osterix) by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment using snap-frozen BM biopsies  thereby achieving minimal post-sampling manipulation  and gene expression profiling (GEP) data  reflecting the in vivo situation. We analyzed 110 biopsies from newly diagnosed patients with MM and monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) and healthy volunteers. LBD was evaluated using standard radiographs and the bone resorption marker CTX-1. Protein levels were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunohistochemistry. Among Wnt inhibitors  only SFRP3 and DKK1 were significantly overexpressed in advanced LBD  correlating with protein levels. SFRP3 correlated with CTX-1. Our findings support osteoblast inhibition as the driving force behind MM LBD.
Needs Assessment,,,Do advanced cancer patients in Denmark receive the help they need? A nationally representative survey of the need related to 12 frequent symptoms/problems. The aim of the study was to investigate the adequacy of help delivered by the healthcare system for 12 symptoms/problems in a national  randomly selected sample of advanced cancer patients in Denmark. Advanced cancer patients (n = 1630) from 54 hospital departments across Denmark received the 3-Levels-of-Needs Questionnaire (3LNQ). The 3LNQ measures 'problem burden'  the degree to which a symptom or problem is perceived as a problem  and 'felt need'  whether the patient receives adequate help. Prevalences were calculated for 'problems' (at least 'a little' of a problem)  'moderate/severe problems' (at least 'quite a bit' of a problem) and 'felt need' (inadequate help or no help despite wanting it). In total  977 (60%) patients participated. The most frequent 'problems' were fatigue (73%; 'moderate/severe' 36%) and limitations doing physical activities (65%; 'moderate/severe' 36%). For the 12 symptoms/problems assessed the prevalence of 'felt need' was 11-35%. Of the patients who had received help  34-74% viewed the help as inadequate. Of those who had not received help  48-78% wished for help. Advanced cancer patients are not receiving the help they need. Large proportions of patients were burdened by symptoms/problems. Of those who had received help  many viewed it as inadequate. Better symptom/problem identification and management is warranted for advanced cancer patients.
Needs Assessment,,,Development and initial validation of the Three-Levels-of-Needs Questionnaire for self-assessment of palliative needs in patients with cancer. To improve palliative care  it is important that questionnaires accurately assess the needs of the patients. No questionnaire existed that combined three different and important approaches to needs assessment. We developed such a questionnaire  called the Three-Levels-of-Needs Questionnaire (3LNQ)  based on literature searches. The 3LNQ measures 12 important needs with three different approaches when used as a supplement to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30): problem intensity  problem burden  and felt need. To investigate the initial validity of the 3LNQ. We used a relatively new method that investigates whether the questionnaire has the same meaning for the patients as for the researchers. To do this  74 patients with advanced cancer filled out the questionnaire and participated in an open-ended interview. The patients' responses to the questionnaire before the interview were compared against the researchers' responses based on the interviews. Items showing substantial agreement were accepted as valid without further analysis. For the remaining items  reasons for disagreements were analyzed qualitatively. All items on problem intensity  eight of 12 items on problem burden  and three of 12 items on felt need were accepted as valid because of high agreement. Analysis of the qualitative data concerning the remaining items showed that most disagreements did not indicate problems with the patients' self-assessment. Instead  different causes for disagreements were elucidated  but these did not interfere with validity. The 3LNQ appears to measure palliative needs comprehensively  and this initial validation showed satisfactory results. The analysis gave important insights into the patients' perceptions of their own situations  into their expectations of the health care system  and into the complexity of needs assessment.
Proteomics,,,Temporal profiling and pulsed SILAC labeling identify novel secreted proteins during ex vivo osteoblast differentiation of human stromal stem cells. It is well established that bone forming cells (osteoblasts) secrete proteins with autocrine  paracrine  and endocrine function. However  the identity and functional role for the majority of these secreted and differentially expressed proteins during the osteoblast (OB) differentiation process  is not fully established. To address these questions  we quantified the temporal dynamics of the human stromal (mesenchymal  skeletal) stem cell (hMSC) secretome during ex vivo OB differentiation using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC). In addition  we employed pulsed SILAC labeling to distinguish genuine secreted proteins from intracellular contaminants. We identified 466 potentially secreted proteins that were quantified at 5 time-points during 14-days ex vivo OB differentiation including 41 proteins known to be involved in OB functions. Among these  315 proteins exhibited more than 2-fold up or down-regulation. The pulsed SILAC method revealed a strong correlation between the fraction of isotope labeling and the subset of proteins known to be secreted and involved in OB differentiation. We verified SILAC data using qRT-PCR analysis of 9 identified potential novel regulators of OB differentiation. Furthermore  we studied the biological effects of one of these proteins  the hormone stanniocalcin 2 (STC2) and demonstrated its autocrine effects in enhancing osteoblastic differentiation of hMSC. In conclusion  combining complete and pulsed SILAC labeling facilitated the identification of novel factors produced by hMSC with potential role in OB differentiation. Our study demonstrates that the secretome of osteoblastic cells is more complex than previously reported and supports the emerging evidence that osteoblastic cells secrete proteins with endocrine functions and regulate cellular processes beyond bone formation.
Proteomics,,,Identification of autophagosome-associated proteins and regulators by quantitative proteomic analysis and genetic screens. Autophagy is one of the major intracellular catabolic pathways  but little is known about the composition of autophagosomes. To study the associated proteins  we isolated autophagosomes from human breast cancer cells using two different biochemical methods and three stimulus types: amino acid deprivation or rapamycin or concanamycin A treatment. The autophagosome-associated proteins were dependent on stimulus  but a core set of proteins was stimulus-independent. Remarkably  proteasomal proteins were abundant among the stimulus-independent common autophagosome-associated proteins  and the activation of autophagy significantly decreased the cellular proteasome level and activity supporting interplay between the two degradation pathways. A screen of yeast strains defective in the orthologs of the human genes encoding for a common set of autophagosome-associated proteins revealed several regulators of autophagy  including subunits of the retromer complex. The combined spatiotemporal proteomic and genetic data sets presented here provide a basis for further characterization of autophagosome biogenesis and cargo selection.
Immunohistochemistry,Proteomics,,Decellularized matrix from tumorigenic human mesenchymal stem cells promotes neovascularization with galectin-1 dependent endothelial interaction. Acquisition of a blood supply is fundamental for extensive tumor growth. We recently described vascular heterogeneity in tumours derived from cell clones of a human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) strain (hMSC-TERT20) immortalized by retroviral vector mediated human telomerase (hTERT) gene expression. Histological analysis showed that cells of the most vascularized tumorigenic clone  -BD11 had a pericyte-like alpha smooth muscle actin (ASMA+) and CD146+ positive phenotype. Upon serum withdrawal in culture  -BD11 cells formed cord-like structures mimicking capillary morphogenesis. In contrast  cells of the poorly tumorigenic clone  -BC8 did not stain for ASMA  tumours were less vascularized and serum withdrawal in culture led to cell death. By exploring the heterogeneity in hMSC-TERT20 clones we aimed to understand molecular mechanisms by which mesenchymal stem cells may promote neovascularization. Quantitative qRT-PCR analysis revealed similar mRNA levels for genes encoding the angiogenic cytokines VEGF and Angiopoietin-1 in both clones. However  clone-BD11 produced a denser extracellular matrix that supported stable ex vivo capillary morphogenesis of human endothelial cells and promoted in vivo neovascularization. Proteomic characterization of the -BD11 decellularized matrix identified 50 extracellular angiogenic proteins  including galectin-1. siRNA knock down of galectin-1 expression abrogated the ex vivo interaction between decellularized -BD11 matrix and endothelial cells. More stable shRNA knock down of galectin-1 expression did not prevent -BD11 tumorigenesis  but greatly reduced endothelial migration into -BD11 cell xenografts. Decellularized hMSC matrix had significant angiogenic potential with at least 50 angiogenic cell surface and extracellular proteins  implicated in attracting endothelial cells  their adhesion and activation to form tubular structures. hMSC -BD11 surface galectin-1 expression was required to bring about matrix-endothelial interactions and for xenografted hMSC -BD11 cells to optimally recruit host vasculature.
Statistics as Topic,,,Sex and individual differences in induced and evoked EEG measures of action observation. We used two established methods for analysing the EEG response of the neurotypical adult human brain to examine the execution and observation of simple motor actions. In one  execution or observation of a button-press in response to a tone caused a decrease in the power at 8-13 Hz ("mu") frequencies. In the other  the response preparation (or the inferred response preparation when these actions are observed in another person) was measured by the averaged response time-locked potentials measured over motor cortex--the "readiness potential". Results indicated that the mirrored readiness potentials were bilaterally generated. We found sex differences for both measures. However  whereas females showed a greater degree of response for the mu power measure during the observation of movement only  males showed larger readiness potentials during both movement performance and observation. Both measures have been claimed to be neural correlates of mirror systems in the brain where processes responsible for actions are linked to the perception of such actions. Such mirror systems have also been implicated in higher order social cognition such as empathy. However  we found no correlations between either of our EEG measures and self-report scales of social cognition. The results imply sex differences in the measured systems and for mirroring that are not directly related to social cognition. We suggest that the results may indicate two dissociable motor mirroring systems that can be measured by induced and evoked EEG.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Trends in Gender Differences in Cardiac Care and Outcome After Acute Myocardial Infarction in Western Sweden: A Report From the Swedish Web System for Enhancement of Evidence-Based Care in Heart Disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies (SWEDEHEART). Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death for both genders. Debates are ongoing as to whether gender-specific differences in clinical course  diagnosis  and management of acute myocardial infarction (MI) exist. We compared all men and women who were treated for acute MI at cardiac care units in Västra Götaland  Sweden  between January 1995 and October 2014 by obtaining data from the prospective SWEDEHEART (Swedish Web-System for Enhancement of Evidence-Based Care in Heart Disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies) registry. We performed unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression analyses on complete case data and on imputed data sets. Overall  48 118 patients (35.4% women) were diagnosed with acute MI. Women as a group had better age-adjusted prognosis than men  but this survival benefit was absent for younger women (aged <60 years) and for women with ST-segment elevation MI. Compared with men  younger women and women with ST-segment elevation MI were more likely to develop prehospital cardiogenic shock (adjusted odds ratio 1.67  95% CI 1.30 to 2.16  P<0.001 and adjusted odds ratio 1.31  95% CI 1.16 to 1.48  P<0.001) and were less likely to be prescribed evidence-based treatment at discharge (P<0.001 for β-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers  statins  and P2Y12 antagonists). Differences in treatment between the genders did not decrease over the study period (P>0.1 for all treatments). Women on average have better adjusted prognosis than men after acute MI; however  younger women and women with ST-segment elevation MI have disproportionately poor prognosis and are less likely to be prescribed evidence-based treatment.
Pathology,Research Report,,A position paper on standardizing the nonneoplastic kidney biopsy report. The biopsy report for nonneoplastic kidney diseases represents a complex integration of clinical data with light  immunofluorescence  and electron microscopic findings. Practice guidelines for the handling and processing of the renal biopsy have previously been created. However  specific guidelines for essential pathologic parameters that should be included in these pathology reports do not exist. The Renal Pathology Society has coordinated an effort through the formation of an ad hoc committee to enumerate the essential elements and pathologic parameters that should be reported for every biopsy specimen. This endeavor aims to establish a minimum reporting standard and to improve communication between pathologists and other physicians. This document represents the collective effort and consensus opinions of this ad hoc committee of the Renal Pathology Society.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Involvement of connective tissue growth factor in human and experimental hypertensive nephrosclerosis. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF; CCN2) has been implicated as a marker and mediator of fibrosis in human and experimental renal disease. We performed a comparative analysis of CTGF expression in hypertensive patients with and without nephrosclerosis  and in uninephrectomized and sham-operated spontaneously hypertensive rats (UNX-SHR and 2K-SHR). Urinary and plasma CTGF were elevated in patients with hypertensive nephrosclerosis  and increased renal CTGF expression was mainly localized in podocytes. Accordingly  elevation of urinary  plasma  and tissue CTGF in UNX-SHR coincided and correlated with proteinuria  glomerulosclerosis  and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Thirty-two weeks after uninephrectomy  mean glomerular CTGF mRNA expression was increased 1.3-fold over baseline  mainly due to 1.7-fold higher expression in glomeruli undergoing sclerosis. In parallel  tubulointerstitial CTGF and α-smooth muscle actin were upregulated in UNX-SHR. CTGF was increased in the media of arcuate and interlobar arteries  while arterioles remained negative. Glomerulosclerosis  tubulointerstitial fibrosis  and arterial media hypertrophy lesions of hypertensive nephrosclerosis are all characterized by increased CTGF tissue expression  which is associated with a concomitant increase in CTGF in blood and urine. These findings identify CTGF as a promising biomarker for progression of hypertensive nephrosclerosis  and as a likely key factor in the pathogenesis of this disease.
Outcome Assessment (Health Care),,,Hamsi scoring in the prediction of unfavorable outcomes from tuberculous meningitis: results of Haydarpasa-II study. Predicting unfavorable outcome is of paramount importance in clinical decision making. Accordingly  we designed this multinational study  which provided the largest case series of tuberculous meningitis (TBM). 43 centers from 14 countries (Albania  Croatia  Denmark  Egypt  France  Hungary  Iraq  Italy  Macedonia  Romania  Serbia  Slovenia  Syria  Turkey) submitted data of microbiologically confirmed TBM patients hospitalized between 2000 and 2012. Unfavorable outcome was defined as survival with significant sequela or death. In developing our index  binary logistic regression models were constructed via 200 replicates of database by bootstrap resampling methodology. The final model was built according to the selection frequencies of variables. The severity scale included variables with arbitrary scores proportional to predictive powers of terms in the final model. The final model was internally validated by bootstrap resampling. A total of 507 patients' data were submitted among which 165 had unfavorable outcome. Eighty-six patients died while 119 had different neurological sequelae in 79 (16%) patients. The full model included 13 variables. Age  nausea  vomiting  altered consciousness  hydrocephalus  vasculitis  immunosuppression  diabetes mellitus and neurological deficit remained in the final model. Scores 1-3 were assigned to the variables in the severity scale  which included scores of 1-6. The distribution of mortality for the scores 1-6 was 3.4  8.2  20.6  31  30 and 40.1%  respectively. Altered consciousness  diabetes mellitus  immunosuppression  neurological deficits  hydrocephalus  and vasculitis predicted the unfavorable outcome in the scoring and the cumulative score provided a linear estimation of prognosis.
Clinical Competence,Curriculum,Education  Medical,[Learning clinical skills]. The purpose of this study was to analyse the learning environment of medical students in a medical ward and on the basis of this study to make specific suggestions as to how the students' clinical stay in a ward can be optimized. These suggestions were implemented and the effect evaluated. This is a qualitative study. Through observations and interviews with students and staff in the ward the learning environment was analysed. After that an evaluation of the implemented project was carried out in a questionnaire to the ward and in interviews with the persons involved in the project. The result of the study concerning analysis and improvement of the students' stay can briefly be summarized as follows: The students' position in the unit can be characterized as that of an observer rather than as an active working participant in the ward. With this there is a risk that the medical student's trainee stay in a ward will turn into a "work-experience placement"  the primary purpose of which will be for the medical student just to dip into the profession. This has consequences for the students' learning process in securing that the students acquire the necessary practical qualifications and acquire essential personal qualifications  such as self-dependence and abilities in decision-making and working under pressure. The study shows that doctors and students agree on the aim of the students' trainee stay: To involve the students in a working partnership in order to obtain the best learning experience. The study concludes that it is difficult to change well-established routines despite good intentions of all parties involved. Therefore  the study rises the question on how new routines are established in the educational culture of medicine.
Internal Medicine,Patient Education as Topic,,[The Good Medical Department. The quality of patient information at the departments of internal medicine]. The purpose of this study was to identify the factors that influence the quality of information given in medical departments and to examine the efforts made to ensure the quality and further improvement of this information. The study is part of the research project "The Good Medical Department". A total of 73 semi-structured interviews were carried out with patients  doctors  nurses and departmental managements. The medical records and nursing case notes were analysed. The quality of information given correlates with the staff's knowledge of the period of hospitalization of their patients. Contact with various doctors and nurses results in patients perceiving statements as being divergent. Information is best communicated in a dialogue. The patients want detailed and written information. Documentation of given information in the medical records was scanty. The outcome of this study indicates some areas that can contribute to ensuring the quality and improvement of patient information. Recent studies also describe lack of quality in these areas. It is a question of restructured planning  delegation of responsibility  documentation  written patient information  and training in communication skills.
Computational Biology,Proteomics,,Unravelling in vitro variables of major importance for the outcome of mass spectrometry-based serum proteomics. The use of mass spectrometry (MS) for analysing low-molecular weight proteins and peptides from biological fluids has a great  yet not fully realized  potential for biomarker discovery. To prune MS-data as much as possible for non-relevant non-biological variation the development of standardized protocols for handling and processing the samples before MS and adjusting data after MS to compensate for method-induced variability are warranted. This calls for knowledge about how different variables contribute to MS-based proteome analyses. In addition  identification of the peptides involved in pre-analytical variation will be helpful in evaluating the clinical significance of predictive models derived from MS data. Using human sera  extraction by weak cation-exchange magnetic beads  and analysis by MALDI-TOF MS we here evaluated pre-analytical variation and identify peptides involved in this. The influences of humidity  temperature  and time for preparation of sera on spectral changes were evaluated. Also  the reproducibility of the methods and the effect of a baseline correction procedure were examined. Low temperatures  short handling times  and a baseline correction procedure minimize the contribution of artifacts to sample variability as observed by MS. The complement split product C3f and fragments thereof appear to be sensitive indicators of sample handling induced modifications. Other peptides that are indicative of such variability are fibrin and kininogen fragments. Using strict experimental guidelines as well as standardized sample collection procedures it is possible to obtain reproducible peak intensities and positions in serum mass profiling using magnetic bead-based fractionation and MALDI-TOF MS.
Drug Design,Immunochemistry,Proteomics,Recent applications of affinity interactions in capillary electrophoresis. Systems biology depends on a comprehensive assignment and characterization of the interactions of proteins and polypeptides (functional proteomics) and of other classes of biomolecules in a given organism. High-capacity screening methods are in place for ligand capture and interaction screening  but a detailed dynamic characterization of molecular interactions under physiological conditions in efficiently separated mixtures with minimal sample consumption is presently provided only by electrophoretic interaction analysis in capillaries  affinity CE (ACE). This has been realized in different fields of biology and analytical chemistry  and the resulting advances and uses of ACE during the last 2.5 years are covered in this review. Dealing with anything from small divalent metal ions to large supramolecular assemblies  the applications of ACE span from low-affinity binding of broad specificity being exploited in optimizing selectivity  e.g.  in enantiomer analysis to miniaturized affinity technologies  e.g.  for fast processing immunoassay. Also  approaches that provide detailed quantitative characterization of analyte-ligand interaction for drug  immunoassay  and aptamer development are increasingly important  but various approaches to ACE are more and more generally applied in biological research. In addition  the present overview emphasizes that distinct challenges regarding sensitivity  parallel processing  information-rich detection  interfacing with MS  analyte recovery  and preparative capabilities remain. This will be addressed by future technological improvements that will ensure continuing new applications of ACE in the years to come.
Proteomics,,,Sample handling for mass spectrometric proteomic investigations of human sera. Proteomic investigations of sera are potentially of value for diagnosis  prognosis  choice of therapy  and disease activity assessment by virtue of discovering new biomarkers and biomarker patterns. Much debate focuses on the biological relevance and the need for identification of such biomarkers while less effort has been invested in devising standard procedures for sample preparation and storage in relation to model building based on complex sets of mass spectrometric (MS) data. Thus  development of standardized methods for collection and storage of patient samples together with standards for transportation and handling of samples are needed. This requires knowledge about how sample processing affects MS-based proteome analyses and thereby how nonbiological biased classification errors are avoided. In this study  we characterize the effects of sample handling  including clotting conditions  storage temperature  storage time  and freeze/thaw cycles  on MS-based proteomics of human serum by using principal components analysis  support vector machine learning  and clustering methods based on genetic algorithms as class modeling and prediction methods. Using spiking to artificially create differentiable sample groups  this integrated approach yields data that--even when working with sample groups that differ more than may be expected in biological studies--clearly demonstrate the need for comparable sampling conditions for samples used for modeling and for the samples that are going into the test set group. Also  the study emphasizes the difference between class prediction and class comparison studies as well as the advantages and disadvantages of different modeling methods.
Nursing,,,Suckling induced activation pattern in the brain of rat pups. The aim of the study was to understand the effects of suckling on the brain of the pups by mapping their brain activation pattern in response to suckling. The c-fos method was applied to identify activated neurons. Fasted rat pups were returned to their mothers for suckling and sacrificed 2 hours later for Fos immunohistochemistry. Double labeling was also performed to characterize some of the activated neurons. For comparison  another group of fasted pups were given dry food before Fos mapping. After suckling  we found an increase in the number of Fos-immunoreactive neurons in the insular and somatosensory cortices  central amygdaloid nucleus (CAm)  paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic hypothalamic nuclei  lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPB)  nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS)  and the area postrema. Double labeling experiments demonstrated the activation of calcitonin gene-related peptide-ir (CGRP-ir) neurons in the LPB  corticotropin-releasing hormone-ir (CRH-ir) but not oxytocin-ir neurons in the PVN  and noradrenergic neurons in the NTS. In the CAm  Fos-ir neurons did not contain CRH but were apposed to CGRP-ir fiber terminals. Refeeding with dry food-induced Fos activation in all brain areas activated by suckling. The degree of activation was higher following dry food consumption than suckling in the insular cortex  and lower in the supraoptic nucleus and the NTS. Furthermore  the accumbens  arcuate  and dorsomedial hypothalamic nuclei  and the lateral hypothalamic area  which were not activated by suckling  showed activation by dry food. Neurons in a number of brain areas are activated during suckling  and may participate in the signaling of satiety  taste perception  reward  food  and salt balance regulation.
Patient Education as Topic,,,Reduced Breastfeeding Rates in Firstborn Late Preterm and Early Term Infants. The primary objective was to determine the rate of breastfeeding by gestational age reported by new mothers 1 month postpartum  with particular focus on early term newborns (37-38(6)/7 weeks). Three thousand six primiparous women aged 18-36 years were interviewed during their third trimester and again 1 month postpartum. Logistic regression analysis was used to model the association between gestational age and breastfeeding 1 month postpartum among those who reported that they planned to breastfeed  controlling for potentially confounding variables. Two thousand seven hundred seventy-two women planned to breastfeed (92.2%)  among whom 116 (4.2%) delivered late preterm (34-36(6)/7 weeks)  519 (18.7%) early term (37-38(6)/7 weeks)  and 2 137 (77.1%) term or postterm (39+ weeks). Among those who delivered late preterm  63.8% were breastfeeding 1 month postpartum  early term 72.6%  and term or postterm 76.5%. This relationship was verified by a multivariate logistic regression analysis; late preterm newborns were significantly less likely to be breastfeeding 1 month postpartum than the term or postterm newborns (odds ratio [OR] 0.44; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28-0.69; p ≤ 0.0001)  as were early term newborns (OR 0.77; 95% CI 0.60-0.99; p = 0.038). In this large prospective study of first-time mothers and newborns  gestational age was significantly associated with breastfeeding 1 month postpartum; highlighting late preterm and early term infants as populations at risk for shortened breastfeeding duration and the need to create specific breastfeeding support and education.
Qualitative Research,,,Behaviours of overweight and obese women during pregnancy who achieve and exceed recommended gestational weight gain. Excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) is associated with increased risk of pregnancy-related complications  postpartum weight retention  and long-term obesity. Little is known about the behavioural habits of pregnant women who achieve and exceed recommended GWG. In 2011  qualitative interviews were conducted in Pennsylvania with postpartum women who were overweight or obese prior to pregnancy to ascertain their behaviours and attitudes regarding dietary habits  physical activity  and self-monitoring during pregnancy. Thematic analysis identified the habits of women who achieved and exceeded recommended GWG guidelines. Of the 29 women interviewed  11 had appropriate GWG and 18 had excessive GWG. Women achieving appropriate GWG reported modest increases in caloric intake if at all  with deliberate meal and snack planning  while women with excessive GWG described "eating-for-two." Nearly all women with excessive GWG reported exercising less during pregnancy (or remaining sedentary)  while women with appropriate GWG largely increased or maintained pre-pregnancy physical activity levels. About half of the sample reported self-monitoring weight gain during pregnancy  but women achieving recommended GWG tied their weight monitoring with GWG goals consistent with recommended guidelines. Women who achieved appropriate GWG reported deliberate dietary habits and physical activity planning  with appropriate GWG goals during pregnancy. Women exceeding recommended GWG described "eating-for-two " were sedentary  and either had no goals for GWG or intended to gain more weight than recommended.
Soil Microbiology,,,Screening for anthrax occurrence in soil of flooded rural areas in Poland after rainfalls in spring 2010. Anthrax spores remain viable and infectious in soil for decades. Flood water can percolate towards the surface the spores buried in soil. Moreover  the flood water might transport spores to areas previously unaffected. After the water recedes the spores located on the surface of the ground can be consumed by grazing animals and cause outbreaks of anthrax. Soil samples were collected in areas of Poland most affected by floods in 2010 (Lubelskie  Świętokrzyskie  Podkarpackie and Mazowieckie provinces). After heating with the aim to kill vegetative forms of bacteria  the samples were cultured on PLET agar and the resulted colonies were investigated in terms of motility and presence of anthrax specific chromosomal (SG-749  plcR) and plasmid markers (capB  pagA). In total  424 spore-forming  aerobically growing isolates were collected from the tested soil samples. Eighty-nine of them were non-motile. All the isolates were negative in PCR for anthrax specific chromosomal and plasmid markers. Spores of B. anthracis that could be related to risk of anthrax outbreaks were not detected in soil samples tested in this study. The negative results presented may not be proof that Poland is country free of anthrax. The results  however  may suggest a relatively low risk of anthrax outbreaks being triggered in the sampled areas.
Aerospace Medicine,,,Venous gas emboli and exhaled nitric oxide with simulated and actual extravehicular activity. The decompression experienced due to the change in pressure from a space vehicle (1013hPa) to that in a suit for extravehicular activity (EVA) (386hPa) was simulated using a hypobaric chamber. Previous ground-based research has indicated around a 50% occurrence of both venous gas emboli (VGE) and symptoms of decompression illness (DCI) after similar decompressions. In contrast  no DCI symptoms have been reported from past or current space activities. Twenty subjects were studied using Doppler ultrasound to detect any VGE during decompression to 386hPa  where they remained for up to 6h. Subjects were supine to simulate weightlessness. A large number of VGE were found in one subject at rest  who had a recent arm fracture; a small number of VGE were found in another subject during provocation with calf contractions. No changes in exhaled nitric oxide were found that can be related to either simulated EVA or actual EVA (studied in a parallel study on four cosmonauts). We conclude that weightlessness appears to be protective against DCI and that exhaled NO is not likely to be useful to monitor VGE.
Acoustics,,,Bayesian State-Space Modelling of Conventional Acoustic Tracking Provides Accurate Descriptors of Home Range Behavior in a Small-Bodied Coastal Fish Species. State-space models (SSM) are increasingly applied in studies involving biotelemetry-generated positional data because they are able to estimate movement parameters from positions that are unobserved or have been observed with non-negligible observational error. Popular telemetry systems in marine coastal fish consist of arrays of omnidirectional acoustic receivers  which generate a multivariate time-series of detection events across the tracking period. Here we report a novel Bayesian fitting of a SSM application that couples mechanistic movement properties within a home range (a specific case of random walk weighted by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process) with a model of observational error typical for data obtained from acoustic receiver arrays. We explored the performance and accuracy of the approach through simulation modelling and extensive sensitivity analyses of the effects of various configurations of movement properties and time-steps among positions. Model results show an accurate and unbiased estimation of the movement parameters  and in most cases the simulated movement parameters were properly retrieved. Only in extreme situations (when fast swimming speeds are combined with pooling the number of detections over long time-steps) the model produced some bias that needs to be accounted for in field applications. Our method was subsequently applied to real acoustic tracking data collected from a small marine coastal fish species  the pearly razorfish  Xyrichtys novacula. The Bayesian SSM we present here constitutes an alternative for those used to the Bayesian way of reasoning. Our Bayesian SSM can be easily adapted and generalized to any species  thereby allowing studies in freely roaming animals on the ecological and evolutionary consequences of home ranges and territory establishment  both in fishes and in other taxa.
Nonlinear Dynamics,,,Ecological assessment of heart rate complexity: Differences between high- and low-anxious adolescents. Nonlinear measures can capture the complex structure of the heart beating  and recordings taken while the individual performs daily activities may help to understand the cardiac system's output in natural conditions. As healthy systems are characterized by having highly complex outputs  we hypothesized that the cardiac output from high anxious adolescents should be less complex than the output from their low anxious counterparts. In this study ECG was recorded for two hours in 50 adolescents while they performed regular school activities. Fractal dimension (FD)  scaling exponents and multiscale entropy were calculated on the interbeat intervals time series. Both FD and entropy were significantly lower in the high-anxious group than the low-anxious group. These results suggest different heart-related regulation in adolescents who suffered from high anxious symptomatology.
Neuroendocrinology,,,Circulating vitamin D concentration and age-related macular degeneration: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Vitamin D may be involved in ocular function in older adults  but there is no current consensus on a possible association between circulating concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) and the occurrence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Our objective was to systematically review and quantitatively assess the association of circulating 25OHD concentration with AMD. A Medline search was conducted in November 2015  with no date limit  using the MeSH terms "Vitamin D" OR "Vitamin D deficiency" OR "Ergocalciferols" OR 'Cholecalciferol' combined with "Age-related macular degeneration" OR "Macular degeneration" OR "Retinal degeneration" OR "Macula lutea" OR "Retina". Fixed and random-effects meta-analyses were performed to compute (i) standard mean difference in 25OHD concentration between AMD and non-AMD patients; (ii) AMD risk according to circulating 25OHD concentration. Of the 243 retrieved studies  11 observational studies-10 cross-sectional studies and 1 cohort study-met the selection criteria. The number of participants ranged from 65 to 17 045 (52-100% women)  and the number with AMD ranged from 31 to 1440. Circulating 25OHD concentration was 15% lower in AMD compared with non-AMD on average. AMD was inversely associated with the highest 25OHD quintile compared with the lowest (summary odds ratio (OR)=0.83 [95%CI:0.71-0.97])  notably late AMD (summary OR=0.47 [95%CI:0.28-0.79]). Circulating 25OHD<50nmol/L was also associated with late-stage AMD (summary OR=2.18 [95%CI:1.34-3.56])  an association that did not persist when all categories of AMD were considered (summary OR=1.26 [95%CI:0.90-1.76]). In conclusion  this meta-analysis provides evidence that high 25OHD concentrations may be protective against AMD  and that 25OHD concentrations below 50nmol/L are associated with late AMD.
Gastroenterology,,,Gluten Introduction and the Risk of Coeliac Disease: A Position Paper by the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology  Hepatology  and Nutrition. The European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology  Hepatology and Nutrition recommended in 2008  based on observational data  to avoid both early (<4 months) and late (≥7 months) introduction of gluten and to introduce gluten while the infant is still being breast-fed. New evidence prompted ESPGHAN to revise these recommendations. To provide updated recommendations regarding gluten introduction in infants and the risk of developing coeliac disease (CD) during childhood. The risk of inducing CD through a gluten-containing diet exclusively applies to persons carrying at least one of the CD risk alleles. Because genetic risk alleles are generally not known in an infant at the time of solid food introduction  the following recommendations apply to all infants  although they are derived from studying families with first-degree relatives with CD. Although breast-feeding should be promoted for its other well-established health benefits  neither any breast-feeding nor breast-feeding during gluten introduction has been shown to reduce the risk of CD. Gluten may be introduced into the infant's diet anytime between 4 and 12 completed months of age. In children at high risk for CD  earlier introduction of gluten (4 vs 6 months or 6 vs 12 months) is associated with earlier development of CD autoimmunity (defined as positive serology) and CD  but the cumulative incidence of each in later childhood is similar. Based on observational data pointing to the association between the amount of gluten intake and risk of CD  consumption of large quantities of gluten should be avoided during the first weeks after gluten introduction and during infancy. The optimal amounts of gluten to be introduced at weaning  however  have not been established.
Family Practice,General Practice,Health Education,Early intervention for childhood overweight: A randomized trial in general practice. To evaluate the effect of two intervention modalities concerning overweight and obesity among children in general practice. Prospective randomized controlled trial. A total of 60 general practices in the former County of Funen  Denmark. Overweight children  identified by International Obesity Task Force criteria  aged 5-9 years. Model 1 with health consultations in general practice during a two-year period or Model 2  an educational programme for the children and their families in addition to the health consultations. Change in body mass index (BMI) z-score in order to compare the results  independent of gender- and age-related changes over time. A total of 80 children were recruited with 35 and 45 children allocated to Model 1 and Model 2  respectively. No significant differences were found in the change in BMI z-score (SDS) between the two groups. A decrease in the mean BMI z-score from baseline to study end of -0.20 (95%CI -0.38 to -0.01) in Model 1 and -0.26 (95%CI -0.44 to -0.09) in Model 2  respectively  was detected. The majority of the participants (2/3) continued in the study for more than one year in both models  with a mean of 12 consultations in general practice. In this particular setting the two intervention strategies against overweight and obesity did not differ significantly with regard to change in BMI z-scores.
Rehabilitation,,,Effects of treadmill training with load addition on non-paretic lower limb on gait parameters after stroke: A randomized controlled clinical trial. The addition of load on the non-paretic lower limb for the purpose of restraining this limb and stimulating the use of the paretic limb has been suggested to improve hemiparetic gait. However  the results are conflicting and only short-term effects have been observed. This study aims to investigate the effects of adding load on non-paretic lower limb during treadmill gait training as a multisession intervention on kinematic gait parameters after stroke. With this aim  38 subacute stroke patients (mean time since stroke: 4.5 months) were randomly divided into two groups: treadmill training with load (equivalent to 5% of body weight) on the non-paretic ankle (experimental group) and treadmill training without load (control group). Both groups performed treadmill training during 30min per day  for two consecutive weeks (nine sessions). Spatiotemporal and angular gait parameters were assessed by a motion system analysis at baseline  post-training (at the end of 9days of interventions) and follow-up (40days after the end of interventions). Several post-training effects were demonstrated: patients walked faster and with longer paretic and non-paretic steps compared to baseline  and maintained these gains at follow-up. In addition  patients exhibited greater hip and knee joint excursion in both limbs at post-training  while maintaining most of these benefits at follow-up. All these improvements were observed in both groups. Although the proposal gait training program has provided better gait parameters for these subacute stroke patients  our data indicate that load addition used as a restraint may not provide additional benefits to gait training.
Toxicology,,,The new insight on the regulatory role of the vitamin D3 in metabolic pathways characteristic for cancerogenesis and neurodegenerative diseases. Apart from the classical function of regulating intestinal  bone and kidney calcium and phosphorus absorption as well as bone mineralization  there is growing evidence for the neuroprotective function of vitamin D3 through neuronal calcium regulation  the antioxidative pathway  immunomodulation and detoxification. Vitamin D3 and its derivates influence directly or indirectly almost all metabolic processes such as proliferation  differentiation  apoptosis  inflammatory processes and mutagenesis. Such multifactorial effects of vitamin D3 can be a profitable source of new therapeutic solutions for two radically divergent diseases  cancer and neurodegeneration. Interestingly  an unusual association seems to exist between the occurrence of these two pathological states  called "inverse comorbidity". Patients with cognitive dysfunctions or dementia have considerably lower risk of cancer  whereas survivors of cancer have lower prevalence of central nervous system (CNS) disorders. To our knowledge  there are few publications analyzing the role of vitamin D3 in biological pathways existing in carcinogenic and neuropathological disorders.
Genomics,Metabolomics,Nutrigenomics,ONION: Functional Approach for Integration of Lipidomics and Transcriptomics Data. To date  the massive quantity of data generated by high-throughput techniques has not yet met bioinformatics treatment required to make full use of it. This is partially due to a mismatch in experimental and analytical study design but primarily due to a lack of adequate analytical approaches. When integrating multiple data types e.g. transcriptomics and metabolomics  multidimensional statistical methods are currently the techniques of choice. Typical statistical approaches  such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA)  that are applied to find associations between metabolites and genes are failing due to small numbers of observations (e.g. conditions  diet etc.) in comparison to data size (number of genes  metabolites). Modifications designed to cope with this issue are not ideal due to the need to add simulated data resulting in a lack of p-value computation or by pruning of variables hence losing potentially valid information. Instead  our approach makes use of verified or putative molecular interactions or functional association to guide analysis. The workflow includes dividing of data sets to reach the expected data structure  statistical analysis within groups and interpretation of results. By applying pathway and network analysis  data obtained by various platforms are grouped with moderate stringency to avoid functional bias. As a consequence CCA and other multivariate models can be applied to calculate robust statistics and provide easy to interpret associations between metabolites and genes to leverage understanding of metabolic response. Effective integration of lipidomics and transcriptomics is demonstrated on publically available murine nutrigenomics data sets. We are able to demonstrate that our approach improves detection of genes related to lipid metabolism  in comparison to applying statistics alone. This is measured by increased percentage of explained variance (95% vs. 75-80%) and by identifying new metabolite-gene associations related to lipid metabolism.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Distribution of PDE8A in the nervous system of the Sprague-Dawley rat. Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are essential regulators of cyclic nucleotide signaling. Little is known of the distribution and function of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) hydrolyzing PDE8A family. Employing immunohistochemistry and Western blots this study maps the distribution of PDE8A in the brain of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats and in the trigeminal ganglion. PDE8A was confined to neuronal perikaryal cytoplasm and to processes extending from those perikarya. The neurons exhibiting PDE8A-immunoreactivity were widely distributed in the forebrain  brain stem  and cerebellum. Strongly immunoreactive neurons were located in the olfactory bulb  the septal area  zona incerta  and reticular nucleus of the thalamus. Less immunoreactivity was seen in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Intense staining was detected in both the substantia nigra and the sensory trigeminal nucleus. In cerebellum PDE8A immunoreactivity was located not only in the Purkinje cells  but also in the granular cells as well as the parallel fibres in the molecular layer. PDE8A immunoreactivity was represented in the epithelial lining of the choroids plexus  the dura mater  and the neurons of the trigeminal ganglion. The localization of the cAMP degrading PDE8A may indicate a role for PDE8A in cAMP signaling related to pain transmission  motor function  cognition and olfaction.
Immunohistochemistry,,,PDE9A  PDE10A  and PDE11A expression in rat trigeminovascular pain signalling system. Activation of the trigeminovascular pain signalling system  including cerebral arteries  meninges  trigeminal ganglion  and brain stem  is involved in migraine. Furthermore  stimulation of cyclic nucleotide (cAMP and cGMP) production as well as inhibition of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) induces headache and migraine. In order to investigate the possible role of PDE in the pain pathway of migraine  expression of the most recently discovered PDE subtypes (9A  10A and 11A) in cerebral arteries  dura mater  and trigeminal ganglion and nucleus was examined. The presence of mRNA and protein in the middle cerebral artery  basilar artery  meninges  trigeminal ganglion  and spinal trigeminal nucleus of male Sprague-Dawley rats were investigated using real-time PCR  Western blot  and immunohistochemistry. The results were compared to two peripheral arteries: aorta and mesenteric artery  as well as neocortex and cerebellar cortex. Real-time PCR and Western blotting showed that PDE9A  PDE10A and PDE11A are expressed in components of the rat trigeminovascular pain signalling system including middle cerebral artery  basilar artery  meninges  trigeminal ganglion and spinal trigeminal nucleus. Aorta and mesenteric artery as well as cerebral neocortex and cerebellar cortex also showed expression of PDE9A  PDE10A and PDE11A. Immunohistochemistry revealed that PDE9A  PDE10A and PDE11A are localised in the cytosol of nerve cell bodies of the trigeminal ganglion. We here present  for the first time  the expression of PDE9A  PDE10A  and PDE11A in the trigeminovascular system. The functional implications are yet unknown  but their localisation indicates that they may have a role in the pain pathway of migraine as well as trigeminal neuralgia and trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias.
Epidemiology,,,Impact of functional somatic symptoms on 5-7-year-olds' healthcare use and costs. Knowledge about childhood functional somatic symptoms (FSS) and healthcare costs is scarce. This study aims to assess whether FSS in children aged 5-7 years are associated with increased future primary healthcare. At baseline of the observational cohort study  between years 2005 and 2007  1327 children from the Copenhagen Child Cohort were assessed at ages 5-7 years for FSS and chronic physical diseases using the Soma Assessment Interview. Information on primary healthcare use was obtained from the National Health Insurance Service Register  and measured as the price of all medical services outside the hospital during a 4.5-year follow-up period from the day of assessment. Regression with bootstrap bias-corrected and accelerated CIs were performed. 1018 (76.8%) children had no FSS with primary healthcare use adjusted for other child health problems  maternal education and family changes of €448.2  388.2-523.8 and number of face-to-face contacts: 11.90  10.71-13.25; 250 (18.9%) had FSS with healthcare use €441.0  355.0-550.3 and face-to-face contacts: 11.22  9.60-12.91  and 58 (4.4%) had impairing FSS with healthcare use: €625.9  447.9-867.8 and face-to-face contacts: 14.65  11.20-19.00. In unadjusted regression analysis  impairing FSS were associated with increased healthcare use (increased costs: €246.0  67.6-494.3). The adjusted association was slightly attenuated (increased costs: €177.8  1.3-417.0). Impairing FSS in children aged 5-7 years is a predictor for the child's future primary healthcare use. More research on complex predictive models is needed to further explore the clinical significance of these results  and to contribute to the underpinning of early interventions towards impairing FSS in children.
Ecology,,,Mosquito larvae (Diptera: Culicidae) in snow-melt pools in a Swedish Lapland area. Culicid larvae were collected in snow-melt pools during the first half of June from 1975-1977 and 1995-1996 in the Abisko Valley  Torne Lapmark  northern Sweden. Twelve species were collected from 102 pools and 81 localities with 7 914 specimens (elevations from 300 to 650 m a.s.l.). Fourteen species are now known from the area. Ten types of larval habitats were classified and ten species were statistically analyzed on pooled values over all years for abundance  coexistence  and diversity. The greatest abundance of individuals had pools with Carex spp. on the bottom. Most widespread and abundant were Oc. hexodontus (Dyar)  Oc. communis (DeGeer)  Oc. pullatus (Coquillett)  and Oc. punctor (Kirby). The two circumpolar  arctic species  Oc. nigripes (Zetterstedt) and Oc. impiger (Walker)  were mainly confined to elevations above 400 m a.s.l. In such marginal habitats as these pools  exposed to variable abitotic conditions  the phenology of species was rather constant. Species diversity varied somewhat between habitats. Oc. hexodontus  Oc. communis  and Oc. pullatus most often occupied pools as single species. Oc. communis and Oc. hexodontus had the highest values for coexistence and also occurred with Oc. punctor. The habitats that were richest in species were those without vegetation or with detritus on the bottom and surrounded by Empetrum nigrum and Betula nana. These habitats contained between eight and ten species. Species abundance and coexistence over the years showed no stable species patterns for the habitat types in the area.
Nursing,,,Becoming Inclusive: A Code of Conduct for Inclusion and Diversity. There are increasing concerns about exclusionary behaviors and lack of diversity in the nursing profession. Exclusionary behaviors  which may include incivility  bullying  and workplace violence  discriminate and isolate individuals and groups who are different  whereas inclusive behaviors encourage diversity. To address inclusion and diversity in nursing  this article offers a code of conduct. This code of conduct builds on existing nursing codes of ethics and applies to nursing students and nurses in both educational and practice settings. Inclusive behaviors that are demonstrated in nurses' relationships with patients  colleagues  the profession  and society are described. This code of conduct provides a basis for measureable change  empowerment  and unification of the profession. Recommendations  implications  and a pledge to action are discussed.
Precision Medicine,,,[Individualized treatment of osteoarticular infections in children may shorten the treatment course]. Older studies have suggested that antibiotic treatment for less than 21 days in children with osteoarticular infections is associated with relapse  and therefore traditionally these infections have been treated for six weeks with an intravenous phase of one week. However  four new prospective studies suggest that if the duration of treatment is individualized and made dependent on the clinical response and the C-reactive protein level  the treatment course may be shortened substantially without increasing the risk of relapse or sequelae. This article reviews older and newer literature on this subject.
Clinical Clerkship,Clinical Competence,Medical Oncology,[Evaluation of trainee doctors' skills]. The objective was to perform a needs assessment of trainee doctors' competences within lumbar puncture and bone marrow aspiration in paediatric oncology. Audit of 30 medical records revealed that five procedures  i.e. collegial  supervised administration of chemotherapy  examination of the child  length of bone marrow biopsy  erythrocytes in cerebrospinal fluid  and documentation of procedures in the medical record  were only handled as intended in half of the cases. Education and supervision of trainee doctors should be prioritized in order to increase their competences and decrease the risk of critical incidents.
Genetics  Population,,,Genetic analyses of thiopurine methyltransferase polymorphisms in Greenlandic and Danish populations. To determine the frequency of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) low-activity alleles in the Greenlandic and Danish populations. 142 Greenlandic individuals and 200 Danish blood donors were screened for the TPMT G460A and A719G low-activity alleles. Thiopurine methyltransferase low-activity alleles were significantly higher in the Greenlandic compared to the Danish population  being 8.1% (95% CI 4.9-11.3) and 3.5% (95% CI 1.7-5.3) (p<0.01)  respectively. Except for one Danish patient with an A719G allele (TPMT*3C)  all the aberrant alleles were compound G460A and A719G alleles (TPMT*3A). In the Danish population  the incidence of thiopurine methyltransferase low-activity alleles was found to be similar to other Caucasian populations previously described. In contrast  the Greenlandic population showed a significantly higher frequency of thiopurine methyltransferase low-activity alleles.
Drug Design,,,Enthalpic Forces Correlate with the Selectivity of Transthyretin-Stabilizing Ligands in Human Plasma. The plasma protein transthyretin (TTR) is linked to human amyloidosis. Dissociation of its native tetrameric assembly is a rate-limiting step in the conversion from a native structure into a pathological amyloidogenic fold. Binding of small molecule ligands within the thyroxine binding site of TTR can stabilize the tetrameric integrity and is a potential therapeutic approach. However  through the characterization of nine different tetramer-stabilizing ligands we found that unspecific binding to plasma components might significantly compromise ligand efficacy. Surprisingly the binding strength between a particular ligand and TTR does not correlate well with its selectivity in plasma. However  through analysis of the thermodynamic signature using isothermal titration calorimetry we discovered a better correlation between selectivity and the enthalpic component of the interaction. This is of specific interest in the quest for more efficient TTR stabilizers  but a high selectivity is an almost universally desired feature within drug design and the finding might have wide-ranging implications for drug design.
Electrophysiology,,,Is the acetylcholine-regulated inwardly rectifying potassium current a viable antiarrhythmic target? Translational discrepancies of AZD2927 and A7071 in dogs and humans. We aimed at examining the acetylcholine-dependent inward-rectifier current (IKAch) as a target for the management of atrial fibrillation (AF). The investigative agents AZD2927 and A7071 concentration-dependently blocked IKACh in vitro with minimal off-target activity. In anaesthetized dogs (n = 17) subjected to 8 weeks of rapid atrial pacing (RAP)  the left atrial effective refractory period (LAERP) was maximally increased by 50 ± 7.4 and 50 ± 4.8 ms following infusion of AZD2927 and A7071. Ventricular refractoriness and the QT interval were unaltered. During sustained AF  both drugs significantly reduced AF frequency and effectively restored sinus rhythm. AZD2927 successfully restored sinus rhythm at 10/10 conversion attempts and A7071 at 14/14 attempts  whereas saline converted 4/17 episodes only (P<0.001 vs. AZD2927 and A7071). In atrial flutter patients (n = 18) undergoing an invasive investigation  AZD2927 did not change LAERP  the paced QT interval  or ventricular refractoriness when compared with placebo. To address the discrepancy on LAERP by IKACh blockade in man and dog and the hypothesis that atrial electrical remodelling is a prerequisite for IKACh blockade being efficient  six dogs were studied after 8 weeks of RAP followed by sinus rhythm for 4 weeks to reverse electrical remodelling. In these dogs  both AZD2927 and A7071 were as effective in increasing LAERP as in the dogs studied immediately after the 8-week RAP period. Based on the present series of experiments  an important role of IKACh in human atrial electrophysiology  as well as its potential as a viable target for effective management of AF  may be questioned.
Evidence-Based Practice,,,Selecting deep brain stimulation or infusion therapies in advanced Parkinson's disease: an evidence-based review. Motor complications in Parkinson's disease (PD) result from the short half-life and irregular plasma fluctuations of oral levodopa. When strategies of providing more continuous dopaminergic stimulation by adjusting oral medication fail  patients may be candidates for one of three device-aided therapies: deep brain stimulation (DBS)  continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusion  or continuous duodenal/jejunal levodopa/carbidopa pump infusion (DLI). These therapies differ in their invasiveness  side-effect profile  and the need for nursing care. So far  very few comparative studies have evaluated the efficacy of the three device-aided therapies for specific motor problems in advanced PD. As a result  neurologists currently lack guidance as to which therapy could be most appropriate for a particular PD patient. A group of experts knowledgeable in all three therapies reviewed the currently available literature for each treatment and identified variables of clinical relevance for choosing one of the three options such as type of motor problems  age  and cognitive and psychiatric status. For each scenario  pragmatic and (if available) evidence-based recommendations are provided as to which patients could be candidates for either DBS  DLI  or subcutaneous apomorphine.
Nursing Methodology Research,Qualitative Research,,Living with advanced Parkinson's disease: a constant struggle with unpredictability. This paper is a report of an exploration of patients' lifeworld and way of managing life with advanced Parkinson's disease prior to Deep Brain Stimulation and what they expect from life following this treatment. Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease  which is initially well-treated with L-dopa. Living with Parkinson's disease means living with the experience of continuous loss of independence and self-esteem and unpredictable ON/OFF phenomena. Thus  in the advanced stage of the disease  treatment with Deep Brain Stimulation may become relevant. Eleven patients eligible for Deep Brain Stimulation were interviewed prior to treatment. Data were collected in 2007 and analysed according to the hermeneutic phenomenological methodology of van Manen  using the four existentials as analytic tools. Living with advanced Parkinson's disease can be described as the experience of living with and managing unpredictability. The disease gradually took over  and participants had to struggle with unpredictability on a daily basis. Themes in relation to this were: The body - setting the agenda  Always a struggle to be on time  Living in dependence and compromise - being a burden  and Living with restrained space and changes in social life. Parkinson's disease leads to profound bodily restrictions. Living with an unpredictable body affects all aspects of life  and nurses need to be aware of the impact the disease has on the entire lifeworld  and how this may affect the way treatment is perceived.
Phylogeography,,,Worldwide population structure of the wheat rust fungus Puccinia striiformis in the past. Puccinia striiformis is a basidiomycete causing yellow rust on wheat. The availability of historic samples of this pathogen from the 'Stubbs collection' enabled us to investigate past population structure and temporal dynamics on a global scale. A set of 212 single genotype urediniospore isolates  representing samples collected from five continents between 1958 and 1991  were genotyped using 19 polymorphic microsatellite markers. The population genetic analyses revealed the existence of seven genetic groups in the past worldwide P. striiformis population. This genetic grouping generally corresponded with geographical sample origin except for the Middle East  where six of the seven genetic groups were represented. The presence of many genetic groups in the Middle Eastern population reflected a low differentiation from the populations in East Africa (FST=0.052) and in South Asia (FST=0.064). A high diversity and recombinant population structure was observed in China and South Asia  while a clonal population structure was observed in NW Europe  East Africa and the Mediterranean region. The high genetic diversity in the Himalayan region supported recent studies suggesting a putative center of diversity for P. striiformis in this area. Four of the 89 multilocus genotypes detected were resampled in different geographical regions suggesting long-distance migration in the past. Comparison of the past populations with more recent ones  represented by 309 isolates mainly collected between 2001 and 2009  revealed temporal divergence for all populations except for Northwest Europe. Overall  we observed a clear subdivision within the worldwide population structure of P. striiformis and migration in the past.
Qualitative Research,,,Near-patient tests and the clinical gaze in decision-making of Swedish GPs not following current guidelines for sore throat - a qualitative interview study. Excessive antibiotics use increases the risk of resistance. Previous studies have shown that the Centor score combined with Rapid Antigen Detection Test (RADT) for Group A Streptococci can reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing in patients with sore throat. According to the former Swedish guidelines RADT was recommended with 2-4 Centor criteria present and antibiotics were recommended if the test was positive. C- reactive protein (CRP) was not recommended for sore throats. Inappropriate use of RADT and CRP has been reported in several studies. From a larger project 16 general practitioners (GPs) who stated management of sore throats not according to the guidelines were identified. Half-hour long semi-structured interviews were conducted. The topics were the management of sore throats and the use of near-patient tests. Qualitative content analysis was used. The use of the near-patient test interplayed with the clinical assessment and the perception that all infections caused by bacteria should be treated with antibiotics. The GPs expressed a belief that the clinical picture was sufficient for diagnosis in typical cases. RADT was not believed to be relevant since it detects only one bacterium  while CRP was considered as a reliable numerical measure of bacterial infection. Inappropriate use of near-patient test can partly be understood as remnants of outdated knowledge. When new guidelines are introduced the differences between them and the former need to be discussed more explicitly.
Family Practice,Qualitative Research,,Management of patients with sore throats in relation to guidelines: an interview study in Sweden. To explore how a group of Swedish general practitioners (GPs) manage patients with a sore throat in relation to current guidelines as expressed in interviews. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyse semi-structured interviews. Swedish primary care. A strategic sample of 25 GPs. Perceived management of sore throat patients. It was found that nine of the interviewed GPs were adherent to current guidelines for sore throat and 16 were non-adherent. The two groups differed in terms of guideline knowledge  which was shared within the team for adherent GPs while idiosyncratic knowledge dominated for the non-adherent GPs. Adherent GPs had no or low concerns for bacterial infections and differential diagnosis whilst non-adherent GPs believed that in patients with a sore throat any bacterial infection should be identified and treated with antibiotics. Patient history and examination was mainly targeted by adherent GPs whilst for non-adherent GPs it was often redundant. Non-adherent GPs reported problems getting patients to abstain from antibiotics  whilst no such problems were reported in adherent GPs. This interview study of sore throat management in a strategically sampled group of Swedish GPs showed that while two-thirds were non-adherent and had a liberal attitude to antibiotics one-third were guideline adherent with a restricted view on antibiotics. Non-adherent GPs revealed significant knowledge gaps. Adherent GPs had discussed guidelines within the primary care team while non-adherent GPs had not. Guideline implementation thus seemed to be promoted by knowledge shared in team discussions.
Histology,,,Cardiac magnetic resonance and electroanatomical mapping of acute and chronic atrial ablation injury: a histological validation study. To provide a comprehensive histopathological validation of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and endocardial voltage mapping of acute and chronic atrial ablation injury. 16 pigs underwent pre-ablation T2-weighted (T2W) and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) CMR and high-density voltage mapping of the right atrium (RA) and both were repeated after intercaval linear radiofrequency ablation. Eight pigs were sacrificed following the procedure for pathological examination. A further eight pigs were recovered for 8 weeks  before chronic CMR  repeat RA voltage mapping and pathological examination. Signal intensity (SI) thresholds from 0 to 15 SD above a reference SI were used to segment the RA in CMR images and segmentations compared with real lesion volumes. The SI thresholds that best approximated histological volumes were 2.3 SD for LGE post-ablation  14.5 SD for T2W post-ablation and 3.3 SD for LGE chronically. T2-weighted chronically always underestimated lesion volume. Acute histology showed transmural injury with coagulative necrosis. Chronic histology showed transmural fibrous scar. The mean voltage at the centre of the ablation line was 3.3 mV pre-ablation  0.6 mV immediately post-ablation  and 0.3 mV chronically. This study presents the first histopathological validation of CMR and endocardial voltage mapping to define acute and chronic atrial ablation injury  including SI thresholds that best match histological lesion volumes. An understanding of these thresholds may allow a more informed assessment of the underlying atrial substrate immediately after ablation and before repeat catheter ablation for atrial arrhythmias.
Electronics,Outcome Assessment (Health Care),,Symptom recording in a randomised clinical trial: paper diaries vs. electronic or telephone data capture. Patients may be asked to register a symptom daily in clinical trials. A problem associated with this kind of registration is that patients do not always fill in the diary at the appropriate time. As there is evidence showing that memory is unreliable  this undermines the entire purpose of collecting daily data on paper diaries. We aimed to compare accuracy  autocorrelations of consecutive entries  and responsiveness in paper diaries (P-Diaries) with electronic diaries (E-Diaries) and telephone diaries (T-Diaries). In a multi-centre  open  and parallel trial  177 patients were allocated at random to P-Diaries  E-Diaries  or T-Diaries for the registration of symptoms through 4 weeks of treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). The primary outcome measure was the diaries. The proportion of patients completing all morning and all evening entries on time was low for both E-Diary and T-Diary groups. By accepting entries that were done half a day late  the proportion was increased to 19/57 (33%) for the E-Diary group  and to 9/61 (15%) for the T-Diary group. For P-Diary  where no control for time registration and entries was adapted  37/59 (63%) of the patients completed all morning and all evening entries. A significant higher autocorrelation in P-Diaries was also found. Responsiveness was similar regardless of method of data capture. The results are consistent with the suggestion that data in the P-Diaries are not filled in at the appropriate time. Use of E-Diaries or T-Diaries improves quality and is recommended in future clinical trials.
Cardiology,Research,,A roadmap to improve the quality of atrial fibrillation management: proceedings from the fifth Atrial Fibrillation Network/European Heart Rhythm Association consensus conference. At least 30 million people worldwide carry a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AF)  and many more suffer from undiagnosed  subclinical  or 'silent' AF. Atrial fibrillation-related cardiovascular mortality and morbidity  including cardiovascular deaths  heart failure  stroke  and hospitalizations  remain unacceptably high  even when evidence-based therapies such as anticoagulation and rate control are used. Furthermore  it is still necessary to define how best to prevent AF  largely due to a lack of clinical measures that would allow identification of treatable causes of AF in any given patient. Hence  there are important unmet clinical and research needs in the evaluation and management of AF patients. The ensuing needs and opportunities for improving the quality of AF care were discussed during the fifth Atrial Fibrillation Network/European Heart Rhythm Association consensus conference in Nice  France  on 22 and 23 January 2015. Here  we report the outcome of this conference  with a focus on (i) learning from our 'neighbours' to improve AF care  (ii) patient-centred approaches to AF management  (iii) structured care of AF patients  (iv) improving the quality of AF treatment  and (v) personalization of AF management. This report ends with a list of priorities for research in AF patients.
Precision Medicine,Genetics,,Personalized management of atrial fibrillation: Proceedings from the fourth Atrial Fibrillation competence NETwork/European Heart Rhythm Association consensus conference. The management of atrial fibrillation (AF) has seen marked changes in past years  with the introduction of new oral anticoagulants  new antiarrhythmic drugs  and the emergence of catheter ablation as a common intervention for rhythm control. Furthermore  new technologies enhance our ability to detect AF. Most clinical management decisions in AF patients can be based on validated parameters that encompass type of presentation  clinical factors  electrocardiogram analysis  and cardiac imaging. Despite these advances  patients with AF are still at increased risk for death  stroke  heart failure  and hospitalizations. During the fourth Atrial Fibrillation competence NETwork/European Heart Rhythm Association (AFNET/EHRA) consensus conference  we identified the following opportunities to personalize management of AF in a better manner with a view to improve outcomes by integrating atrial morphology and damage  brain imaging  information on genetic predisposition  systemic or local inflammation  and markers for cardiac strain. Each of these promising avenues requires validation in the context of existing risk factors in patients. More importantly  a new taxonomy of AF may be needed based on the pathophysiological type of AF to allow personalized management of AF to come to full fruition. Continued translational research efforts are needed to personalize management of this prevalent disease in a better manner. All the efforts are expected to improve the management of patients with AF based on personalized therapy.
Drug Design,,,Metallomics in drug development: characterization of a liposomal cisplatin drug formulation in human plasma by CE-ICP-MS. A capillary electrophoresis inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry method for separation of free cisplatin from liposome-encapsulated cisplatin and protein-bound cisplatin was developed. A liposomal formulation of cisplatin based on PEGylated liposomes was used as model drug formulation. The effect of human plasma matrix on the analysis of liposome-encapsulated cisplatin and intact cisplatin was studied. The presence of 1 % of dextran and 4 mM of sodium dodecyl sulfate in HEPES buffer was demonstrated to be effective in improving the separation of liposomes and cisplatin bound to proteins in plasma. A detection limit of 41 ng/mL of platinum and a precision of 2.1 % (for 10 μg/mL of cisplatin standard) were obtained. Simultaneous measurements of phosphorous and platinum allows the simultaneous monitoring of the liposomes  liposome-encapsulated cisplatin  free cisplatin and cisplatin bound to plasma constituents in plasma samples. It was demonstrated that this approach is suitable for studies of the stability of liposome formulations as leakage of active drug from the liposomes and subsequent binding to biomolecules in plasma can be monitored. This methodology has not been reported before and will improve characterization of liposomal drugs during drug development and in studies on kinetics.
Curriculum,Education  Medical  Graduate,Internship and Residency,From Surviving to Advising: A Novel Course Pairing Mental Health and Addictions Service Users as Advisors to Senior Psychiatry Residents. The authors describe a novel course that pairs service users as advisors to senior psychiatry residents with the goals of improving the residents' understanding of recovery  reducing negative stereotypes about people in recovery  and empowering the service users who participated. Service users who had experience working as peer support workers and/or system advocates were selected for a broad and deep understanding of recovery and an ability to engage learners in constructive dialogue. They met monthly with resident advisees over a period of 6 months. They were supported with monthly group supervision meetings and were paid an honorarium. Quantitative evaluations and qualitative feedback from the first two cohorts of the course  comprising 34 pairs  are reported here. The first cohort of residents responded with a wide range of global ratings and reactions. In response to their suggestions  changes were made to the structure of the course to create opportunities for small group learning and reflective writing and to protect time for residents to participate. The second cohort of residents and both cohorts of service users gave acceptably high global ratings. Residents in the second cohort described gaining a number of benefits from the course  including an enhanced understanding of the lived experience of recovery and a greater sense of shared humanity with service users. Advisors described an appreciation for being part of something that has the potential for changing the practice of psychiatry and enhancing the lives of their peers. Positioning service users as advisors to psychiatry residents holds promise as a powerful way of reducing distance between future psychiatrists and service users and facilitating system reform toward person-centered recovery-oriented care.
Anesthesiology,Clinical Competence,,Evaluating structured assessment of anaesthesiologists' non-technical skills. Non-technical skills (NTS) are essential for safe and efficient anaesthesia. Assessment instruments with appropriate validity evidence can be used to ensure that anaesthesiologists possess the NTS necessary to deliver high-standard patient care. The aims were to collect validity evidence using a contemporary validity framework for the assessment instrument Anaesthesiologists' Non-Technical Skills in Denmark (ANTSdk) regarding response process and internal structure (including reliability)  and to investigate the effect of rater training on these properties. An explorative study was undertaken at the Danish Institute for Medical Simulation  Copenhagen  Denmark. In a 1-day session  using ANTSdk  a convenience sample of 19 anaesthesiologists rated trainee anaesthesiologists' NTS in nine video-recorded simulation scenarios before and after a 3-h training session. Response process evidence: participants considered ANTSdk useful and feasible for NTS assessment. Internal structure evidence: inter-rater reliability (single measures) largely expressed substantial agreement (ICC ≥ 0.55 and ICC ≥ 0.60 for pre- and post-training ratings respectively). Strong internal consistency of ratings was found (Spearman's correlation coefficient ≥ 0.82). Accuracy of participants' ratings compared with reference ratings (± 1 scale point) was notable (76% and 78% for pre- and post-training ratings  respectively). The results indicate that the elements 'Demonstrating self-awareness'  'Reassessing decisions'  'Assessing competencies'  and 'Supporting others' need more attention in future rater training. The validity evidence collected on content  response process  and internal structure  suggests that ANTSdk is easy to use on video-recorded simulation scenarios  indicating that ANTSdk is a feasible instrument for NTS assessment during anaesthesia training.
Clinical Competence,Competency-Based Education,Education  Medical  Graduate,How to set the bar in competency-based medical education: standard setting after an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE). The goal of the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) in Competency-based Medical Education (CBME) is to establish a minimal level of competence. The purpose of this study was to 1) to determine the credibility and acceptability of the modified Angoff method of standard setting in the setting of CBME  using the Borderline Group (BG) method and the Borderline Regression (BLR) method as a reference standard; 2) to determine if it is feasible to set different standards for junior and senior residents  and 3) to determine the desired characteristics of the judges applying the modified Angoff method. The results of a previous OSCE study (21 junior residents  18 senior residents  and six fellows) were used. Three groups of judges performed the modified Angoff method for both junior and senior residents: 1) sports medicine surgeons  2) non-sports medicine orthopedic surgeons  and 3) sports fellows. Judges defined a borderline resident as a resident performing at a level between competent and a novice at each station. For each checklist item  the judges answered yes or no for "will the borderline/advanced beginner examinee respond correctly to this item?" The pass mark was calculated by averaging the scores. This pass mark was compared to that created using both the BG and the BLR methods. A paired t-test showed that all examiner groups expected senior residents to get significantly higher percentage of checklist items correct compared to junior residents (all stations p < 0.001). There were no significant differences due to judge type. For senior residents  there were no significant differences between the cut scores determined by the modified Angoff method and the BG/BLR method. For junior residents  the cut scores determined by the modified Angoff method were lower than the cut scores determined by the BG/BLR Method (all p < 0.01). The results of this study show that the modified Angoff method is an acceptable method of setting different pass marks for senior and junior residents. The use of this method enables both senior and junior residents to sit the same OSCE  preferable in the regular assessment environment of CBME.
Clinical Competence,Education  Medical,Education  Nursing,Collaborative learning of clinical skills in health professions education: the why  how  when and for whom. This study is designed to provide an overview of why  how  when and for whom collaborative learning of clinical skills may work in health professions education. Collaborative learning of clinical skills may influence learning positively according to the non-medical literature. Training efficiency may therefore be improved if the outcomes of collaborative learning of clinical skills are superior or equivalent to those attained through individual learning. According to a social interaction perspective  collaborative learning of clinical skills mediates its effects through social interaction  motivation  accountability and positive interdependence between learners. Motor skills learning theory suggests that positive effects rely on observational learning and action imitation  and negative effects may include decreased hands-on experience. Finally  a cognitive perspective suggests that learning is dependent on cognitive co-construction  shared knowledge and reduced cognitive load. The literature on the collaborative learning of clinical skills in health science education is reviewed to support or contradict the hypotheses provided by the theories outlined above. Collaborative learning of clinical skills leads to improvements in self-efficacy  confidence and performance when task processing is observable or communicable. However  the effects of collaborative learning of clinical skills may decrease over time as benefits in terms of shared cognition  scaffolding and cognitive co-construction are outweighed by reductions in hands-on experience and time on task. Collaborative learning of clinical skills has demonstrated promising results in the simulated setting. However  further research into how collaborative learning of clinical skills may work in clinical settings  as well as into the role of social dynamics between learners  is required.
Clinical Competence,Competency-Based Education,Internship and Residency,Competency-Based Medical Education: Can Both Junior Residents and Senior Residents Achieve Competence After a Sports Medicine Training Module? Competency-based medical education as a resident-training format will move postgraduate training away from time-based training  to a model based on observable outcomes. The purpose of this study was to determine whether junior residents and senior residents could demonstrate clinical skills to a similar level  after a sports medicine rotation. All residents undertaking a three-month sports medicine rotation had to pass an Objective Structured Clinical Examination. The stations tested the fundamentals of history-taking  examination  image interpretation  differential diagnosis  informed consent  and clinical decision-making. Performance at each station was assessed with a binary station-specific checklist and an overall global rating scale  in which 1 indicated novice  2 indicated advanced beginner  3 indicated competent  4 indicated proficient  and 5 indicated expert. A global rating scale was also given for each domain of knowledge. Over eighteen months  thirty-nine residents (twenty-one junior residents and eighteen senior residents) and six fellows (for a total of forty-five participants) completed the examination. With regard to junior residents and senior residents  analysis using a two-tailed t test demonstrated a significant difference (p < 0.01) in both total checklist score and overall global rating scale; the mean total checklist score (and standard deviation) was 56.15% ± 10.99% for junior residents and 71.87% ± 8.94% for senior residents  and the mean global rating scale was 2.44 ± 0.55 for junior residents and 3.79 ± 0.49 for senior residents. There was a significant difference between junior residents and senior residents for each knowledge domain  with a significance of p < 0.05 for history-taking and p < 0.01 for the remainder of the domains. Despite intensive teaching within a competency-based medical education model  junior residents were not able to demonstrate knowledge as well as senior residents  suggesting that overall clinical experience is critically important for achieving competency as measured by the Objective Structured Clinical Examination.
Education  Medical  Undergraduate,Health Occupations,Midwifery,Linking quality of care and training costs: cost-effectiveness in health professions education. To provide a model for conducting cost-effectiveness analyses in medical education. The model was based on a randomised trial examining the effects of training midwives to perform cervical length measurement (CLM) as compared with obstetricians on patients' waiting times. (CLM)  as compared with obstetricians. The model included four steps: (i) gathering data on training outcomes  (ii) assessing total costs and effects  (iii) calculating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and (iv) estimating cost-effectiveness probability for different willingness to pay (WTP) values. To provide a model example  we conducted a randomised cost-effectiveness trial. Midwives were randomised to CLM training (midwife-performed CLMs) or no training (initial management by midwife  and CLM performed by obstetrician). Intervention-group participants underwent simulation-based and clinical training until they were proficient. During the following 6 months  waiting times from arrival to admission or discharge were recorded for women who presented with symptoms of pre-term labour. Outcomes for women managed by intervention and control-group participants were compared. These data were then used for the remaining steps of the cost-effectiveness model. Intervention-group participants needed a mean 268.2 (95% confidence interval [CI]  140.2-392.2) minutes of simulator training and a mean 7.3 (95% CI  4.4-10.3) supervised scans to attain proficiency. Women who were scanned by intervention-group participants had significantly reduced waiting time compared with those managed by the control group (n = 65; mean difference  36.6 [95% CI 7.3-65.8] minutes; p = 0.008)  which corresponded to an ICER of 0.45 EUR minute(-1) . For WTP values less than EUR 0.26 minute(-1)   obstetrician-performed CLM was the most cost-effective strategy  whereas midwife-performed CLM was cost-effective for WTP values above EUR 0.73 minute(-1) . Cost-effectiveness models can be used to link quality of care to training costs. The example used in the present study demonstrated that different training strategies could be recommended as the most cost-effective depending on administrators' willingness to pay per unit of the outcome variable.
Clinical Competence,Education  Medical  Continuing,,Transfer from point-of-care Ultrasonography training to diagnostic performance on patients--a randomized controlled trial. Clinicians are increasingly using point-of-care ultrasonography for bedside examinations of patients. However  proper training is needed in this technique  and it is unknown whether the skills learned from focused Ultrasonography courses are being transferred to diagnostic performance on patients. Thirty-one physicians were randomized to participate in a focused Ultrasonography course or control circumstances before they examined 4 patients with different abdominal conditions by ultrasonography. Performance scores and diagnostic accuracy were compared using independent samples t test and binary logistic regression  respectively. There was a significant difference in the performance score between the intervention group (27.4%) and the control group (18.0%  P = .004) and the diagnostic accuracy between the intervention group (65%) and the control group (39%  P = .014). Clinicians could successfully transfer learning from an Ultrasonography course to improve diagnostic performance on patients. However  our results also indicate a need for more training when new technologies such as point-of-care ultrasonography are introduced.
Microscopy,,,Rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing of clinical isolates by digital time-lapse microscopy. Rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) is essential for early and appropriate therapy. Methods with short detection time enabling same-day treatment optimisation are highly favourable. In this study  we evaluated the potential of a digital time-lapse microscope system  the oCelloScope system  to perform rapid AST. The oCelloScope system demonstrated a very high accuracy (96% overall agreement) when determining the resistance profiles of four reference strains  nine clinical isolates  including multi-drug-resistant isolates  and three positive blood cultures. AST of clinical isolates (168 antimicrobial agent-organism combinations) demonstrated 3.6% minor  no major and 1.2% very major errors of the oCelloScope system compared to conventional susceptibility testing  as well as a rapid and correct phenotypic detection of strains with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) profiles. The net average time-to-result was 108 min  with 95% of the results being available within 180 min. In conclusion  this study strongly indicates that the oCelloScope system holds considerable potential as an accurate and sensitive AST method with short time-to-result  enabling same-day targeted antimicrobial therapy  facilitating antibiotic stewardship and better patient management. A full-scale validation of the oCelloScope system including more isolates is necessary to assess the impact of using it for AST.
Hematology,,,Outbreak of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteraemia in a haematology department. Infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality among immunocompromised patients. In Denmark  an increase in P. aeruginosa isolates from blood cultures from a haematology department prompted a hygienic audit in 2007. Blood cultures that tested positive for P. aeruginosa were collected from the laboratory information system (MADS  Skejby Hospital  Aarhus  Denmark). Environmental samples were obtained from shower heads in the department. The genotype was established by pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). An audit was conducted during the outbreak and 12 months later. The audits were conducted by the method of direct observation. Several PFGE types were involved with no clear association to isolates from environmental samples. The audit revealed poor hygiene related to the handling of central venous catheters. After optimising catheter hygiene  the number of P. aeruginosa bacteraemia cases fell significantly. Since no clear association between patient and environmental genotype was established  it was suspected that central venous catheters were the main portal of entry. This was further supported by a simultaneous decline in bacteraemia cases with coagulase-negative staphylococci. Though several hygienic precautions were taken  the increased focus on disinfection of hubs and injection ports was presumably the more important element. not relevant. not relevant.
Genetics,,,A frameshift deletion in the sarcomere gene MYL4 causes early-onset familial atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia in man  causing substantial morbidity and mortality with a major worldwide public health impact. It is increasingly recognized as a highly heritable condition. This study aimed to determine genetic risk factors for early-onset AF. We sequenced the whole genomes of 8453 Icelanders and imputed genotypes of the 25.5 million sequence variants we discovered into 1799 Icelanders with early-onset AF (diagnosed before 60 years of age) and 337 453 controls. Each sequence variant was tested for association based on multiplicative and recessive inheritance models. We discovered a rare frameshift deletion in the myosin MYL4 gene (c.234delC) that associates with early-onset AF under a recessive mode of inheritance (allelic frequency = 0.58%). We found eight homozygous carriers of the mutation  all of whom had early-onset AF. Six of the homozygotes were diagnosed by the age of 30 and the remaining two in their 50s. Three of the homozygotes had received pacemaker implantations due to sick sinus syndrome  three had suffered an ischemic stroke  and one suffered sudden cardiac death. Through a population approach we found a loss of function mutation in the myosin gene MYL4 that  in the homozygous state  is completely penetrant for early-onset AF. The finding may provide novel mechanistic insight into the pathophysiology of this complex arrhythmia.
Phylogeography,,,Multiple introductions and recent spread of the emerging human pathogen Mycobacterium ulcerans across Africa. Buruli ulcer (BU) is an insidious neglected tropical disease. Cases are reported around the world but the rural regions of West and Central Africa are most affected. How BU is transmitted and spreads has remained a mystery  even though the causative agent  Mycobacterium ulcerans  has been known for more than 70 years. Here  using the tools of population genomics  we reconstruct the evolutionary history of M. ulcerans by comparing 165 isolates spanning 48 years and representing 11 endemic countries across Africa. The genetic diversity of African M. ulcerans was found to be restricted due to the bacterium's slow substitution rate coupled with its relatively recent origin. We identified two specific M. ulcerans lineages within the African continent  and inferred that M. ulcerans lineage Mu_A1 existed in Africa for several hundreds of years  unlike lineage Mu_A2  which was introduced much more recently  approximately during the 19th century. Additionally  we observed that specific M. ulcerans epidemic Mu_A1 clones were introduced during the same time period in the three hydrological basins that were well covered in our panel. The estimated time span of the introduction events coincides with the Neo-imperialism period  during which time the European colonial powers divided the African continent among themselves. Using this temporal association  and in the absence of a known BU reservoir or -vector on the continent  we postulate that the so-called "Scramble for Africa" played a significant role in the spread of the disease across the continent.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Axotomy induces contrasting changes in calcium and calcium-binding proteins in oculomotor and hypoglossal nuclei of Balb/c mice. Motor neurons with different susceptibility to degeneration have been identified in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Increase of intracellular calcium has been proposed as a mediator  amplifying the damage through a positive feedback of the known pathological processes. Accordingly  the potential of motor neurons to limit calcium increases during injury might be proportional to their viability. A basic mechanism of reducing calcium amplitudes depends on the calcium-buffering capacity  determined by the calcium-binding protein content. In this study  oculomotor and hypoglossal neurons  prototypes of resistant and vulnerable motor neurons in ALS were examined in axotomy experiments. Total calcium-  parvalbumin-  and calbindin-D28k levels of motor neurons of adult mice were characterized by electron microscopic histochemistry and light microscopic immunostaining. In hypoglossal neurons  compared with oculomotor neurons  larger and more enduring increases of calcium were detected. The perikarya of hypoglossal neurons remained immunonegative for both parvalbumin and calbindin-D28k. Qualitatively  no major cell loss was noted after axotomy  but a decreased neuronal marker staining at days 1-14 suggested a reversible injury of hypoglossal neurons. Oculomotor neurons were not stained for calbindin-D28k but stained for parvalbumin in control conditions  staining which increased at postoperative days 7-14 before returning to baseline. Neuronal marker staining did not change in these cells during the observed period. The higher level of parvalbumin in resistant motor neurons and their ability to up-regulate parvalbumin after injury  paralleled by a smaller increase of intracellular calcium suggest that parvalbumin may have a protective effect in these cells.
Outcome Assessment (Health Care),,,Influence of Factor V Leiden on susceptibility to and outcome from critical illness: a genetic association study. Disturbance of the pro-coagulatant and anti-coagulant balance is associated with a poor outcome from critical illness. The objective of this study is to determine whether the Factor V Leiden (FVL) mutation is associated with susceptibility to or death from critical illness. A genetic association study involving four case cohorts comprising two Gram negative sepsis  one invasive pneumococcal disease and one intensive care unit cohort with a total of 1 249 patients. Controls were derived from a population-based cohort study (N = 8 147). DNA from patients and controls was genotyped for the FVL mutation. When all patients were investigated together no significant difference in the frequency of FVL mutation was observed compared with controls (odds ratio (OR)  1.03; 95% confidence interval (CI)  0.83 to 1.29). However  when stratified among patients admitted to intensive care (N = 237)  susceptibility and the likelihood of long-term death was influenced by the FVL mutation. In adjusted logistic regression analysis  FVL carriers had an increased risk of ICU admission compared to non-carriers (OR 1.62; 95% CI  1.08 to 2.42). In adjusted Cox regression analysis  FVL carriers were at increased risk of long-term death compared to non-carriers (relative risk 1.78; 95% CI  1.13 to 2.81). FVL carrier status did not predict either susceptibility to or outcome from Gram negative  Escherichia coli or Streptococcus pneumoniae sepsis. Overall  the FVL mutation did not appear to increase the risk of admission due to severe invasive infections. Nevertheless  in the subgroup of patients admitted to intensive care an increased risk and a poorer long-term outcome for individuals with critical illness were observed for FVL mutation carriers.
Outcome Assessment (Health Care),,,Factor V leiden homozygosity  dyspnea  and reduced pulmonary function. Factor V Leiden homozygosity predisposes patients to deep venous thrombosis and major pulmonary thromboembolism. Consequently  factor V Leiden homozygosity could  via unrecognized repeated minor pulmonary thromboemboli  cause chronic pulmonary disease. We tested the hypothesis that factor V Leiden homozygosity is associated with pulmonary symptoms and signs. We studied a general population sample of 9253 individuals from the Copenhagen City Heart Study who were examined in 1991-1994. Of these  6475 participants were also examined in 1976-1978 and/or 1981-1983. End points were dyspnea and lung function. Among 20 factor V Leiden homozygotes  a mean +/- SD of 32% +/- 11% had severe dyspnea compared with 6% +/- 0.3% of 8534 noncarriers (chi(2) test; P<.001). The corresponding adjusted odds ratio for severe dyspnea was 5.4 (95% confidence interval  1.9-15.7). During follow-up  forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity were 5% to 10% lower in homozygotes vs noncarriers (analysis of variance; P = .003 and P = .03). The annual mean +/- SD loss of forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity was 39 +/- 8 mL/y and 35 +/- 8 mL/y in homozygotes vs 21 +/- 10 mL/y and 15 +/- 10 mL/y in noncarriers (t test; P = .03 and P = .04)  respectively. Factor V Leiden heterozygosity (n = 699) did not influence pulmonary symptoms and signs. We demonstrate a previously unrecognized clinical presentation of factor V Leiden homozygosity with severe dyspnea and decreased pulmonary function.
Physical Education and Training,,,Effect of 5 wk of detraining on epinephrine response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia in athletes. Long-term endurance-trained subjects are known to have an enhanced capacity to secrete epinephrine. It is  however  unknown to what extent this is a reversible phenomenon  i.e.  whether the adrenal medullary secretory capacity is diminished during a period of abstinence from training. Hormonal responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia were studied in seven endurance-trained young male athletes at the onset and the termination of a 31- to 44-day period of detraining necessitated by a sports injury that required leg casting. During insulin infusion  plasma glucose decreased to a mean range of 2.0-2.1 mM for the two conditions. The epinephrine response to hypoglycemia did not decrease significantly during the 4-6 wk of detraining (P greater than 0.05). Responses of other counterregulatory hormones  i.e.  norepinephrine  glucagon  growth hormone  and cortisol  were identical in trained and detrained subjects (P greater than 0.05). Heart rate and blood pressure responses to hypoglycemia were similar in the two conditions (P greater than 0.05). In conclusion  in endurance athletes the enhanced capacity to secrete epinephrine is maintained during 5 wk of detraining.
Clinical Competence,Education  Medical  Graduate,Internship and Residency,Radiology Trainee Performance in Digital Breast Tomosynthesis: Relationship Between Difficulty and Error-Making Patterns. The aim of this study was to better understand the relationship between digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) difficulty and radiology trainee performance. Twenty-seven radiology residents and fellows and three expert breast imagers reviewed 60 DBT studies consisting of unilateral craniocaudal and medial lateral oblique views. Trainees had no prior DBT experience. All readers provided difficulty ratings and final BI-RADS(®) scores. Expert breast imager consensus interpretations were used to determine the ground truth. Trainee sensitivity  specificity  and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated for low- and high-difficulty subsets of cases as assessed by each trainee him or herself (self-assessed difficulty) and consensus expert-assessed difficulty. For self-assessed difficulty  the trainee AUC was 0.696 for high-difficulty and 0.704 for low-difficulty cases (P = .753). Trainee sensitivity was 0.776 for high-difficulty and 0.538 for low-difficulty cases (P < .001). Trainee specificity was 0.558 for high-difficulty and 0.810 for low-difficulty cases (P < .001). For expert-assessed difficulty  the trainee AUC was 0.645 for high-difficulty and 0.816 for low-difficulty cases (P < .001). Trainee sensitivity was 0.612 for high-difficulty and .784 for low-difficulty cases (P < .001). Trainee specificity was 0.654 for high-difficulty and 0.765 for low-difficulty cases (P = .021). Cases deemed difficult by experts were associated with decreases in trainee AUC  sensitivity  and specificity. In contrast  for self-assessed more difficult cases  the trainee AUC was unchanged because of increased sensitivity and compensatory decreased specificity. Educators should incorporate these findings when developing educational materials to teach interpretation of DBT.
Genomics,Precision Medicine,Radiology,Radiogenomics: what it is and why it is important. In recent years  a new direction in cancer research has emerged that focuses on the relationship between imaging phenotypes and genomics. This direction is referred to as radiogenomics or imaging genomics. The question that subsequently arises is: What is the practical significance of elucidating this relationship in improving cancer patient outcomes. In this article  I address this question. Although I discuss some limitations of the radiogenomic approach  and describe scenarios in which radiogenomic analysis might not be the best choice  I also argue that radiogenomics will play a significant practical role in cancer research. Specifically  I argue that the significance of radiogenomics is largely related to practical limitations of currently available data that often lack complete characterization of the patients and poor integration of individual datasets. Radiogenomics offers a practical way to leverage limited and incomplete data to generate knowledge that might lead to improved decision making  and as a result  improved patient outcomes.
Clinical Competence,Education  Medical  Graduate,Internship and Residency,Does Breast Imaging Experience During Residency Translate Into Improved Initial Performance in Digital Breast Tomosynthesis? To determine the initial digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) performance of radiology trainees with varying degrees of breast imaging experience. To test trainee performance with DBT  we performed a reader study  after obtaining IRB approval. Two medical students  20 radiology residents  4 nonbreast imaging fellows  3 breast imaging fellows  and 3 fellowship-trained breast imagers reviewed 60 unilateral DBT studies (craniocaudal and medio-lateral oblique views). Trainees had no DBT experience. Each reader recorded a final BI-RADS assessment for each case. The consensus interpretations from fellowship-trained breast imagers were used to establish the ground truth. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)  sensitivity  and specificity were calculated. For analysis  first- through third-year residents were classified as junior trainees  and fourth-year residents plus nonbreast imaging fellows were classified as senior trainees. The AUCs were .569 for medical students  .721 for junior trainees  .701 for senior trainees  and .792 for breast imaging fellows. The junior and senior trainee AUCs were equivalent (P < .01) using a two one-sided test for equivalence  with a significance threshold of 0.1. The sensitivities and specificities were highest for breast imaging fellows (.778 and .815 respectively)  but similar for junior (.631 and .714  respectively) and senior trainees (.678 and .661  respectively). Initial performance with DBT among radiology residents and nonbreast imaging fellows is independent of years of training. Radiology educators should consider these findings when developing educational materials.
Genomics,Precision Medicine,Radiology,Computational approach to radiogenomics of breast cancer: Luminal A and luminal B molecular subtypes are associated with imaging features on routine breast MRI extracted using computer vision algorithms. To identify associations between semiautomatically extracted MRI features and breast cancer molecular subtypes. We analyzed routine clinical pre-operative breast MRIs from 275 breast cancer patients at a single institution in this retrospective  Institutional Review Board-approved study. Six fellowship-trained breast imagers reviewed the MRIs and annotated the cancers. Computer vision algorithms were then used to extract 56 imaging features from the cancers including morphologic  texture  and dynamic features. Surrogate markers (estrogen receptor [ER]  progesterone receptor [PR]  human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 [HER2]) were used to categorize tumors by molecular subtype: ER/PR+  HER2- (luminal A); ER/PR+  HER2+ (luminal B); ER/PR-  HER2+ (HER2); ER/PR/HER2- (basal). A multivariate analysis was used to determine associations between the imaging features and molecular subtype. The imaging features were associated with both luminal A (P = 0.0007) and luminal B (P = 0.0063) molecular subtypes. No association was found for either HER2 (P = 0.2465) or basal (P = 0.1014) molecular subtype and the imaging features. A P-value of 0.0125 (0.05/4) was considered significant. Luminal A and luminal B molecular subtype breast cancer are associated with semiautomatically extracted features from routine contrast enhanced breast MRI.
Computational Biology,Radiology,,Modeling false positive error making patterns in radiology trainees for improved mammography education. While mammography notably contributes to earlier detection of breast cancer  it has its limitations  including a large number of false positive exams. Improved radiology education could potentially contribute to alleviating this issue. Toward this goal  in this paper we propose an algorithm for modeling of false positive error making among radiology trainees. Identifying troublesome locations for the trainees could focus their training and in turn improve their performance. The algorithm proposed in this paper predicts locations that are likely to result in a false positive error for each trainee based on the previous annotations made by the trainee. The algorithm consists of three steps. First  the suspicious false positive locations are identified in mammograms by Difference of Gaussian filter and suspicious regions are segmented by computer vision-based segmentation algorithms. Second  133 features are extracted for each suspicious region to describe its distinctive characteristics. Third  a random forest classifier is applied to predict the likelihood of the trainee making a false positive error using the extracted features. The random forest classifier is trained using previous annotations made by the trainee. We evaluated the algorithm using data from a reader study in which 3 experts and 10 trainees interpreted 100 mammographic cases. The algorithm was able to identify locations where the trainee will commit a false positive error with accuracy higher than an algorithm that selects such locations randomly. Specifically  our algorithm found false positive locations with 40% accuracy when only 1 location was selected for all cases for each trainee and 12% accuracy when 10 locations were selected. The accuracies for randomly identified locations were both 0% for these two scenarios. In this first study on the topic  we were able to build computer models that were able to find locations for which a trainee will make a false positive error in images that were not previously seen by the trainee. Presenting the trainees with such locations rather than randomly selected ones may improve their educational outcomes.
Computer-Assisted Instruction,Internship and Residency,Radiology,Using computer-extracted image features for modeling of error-making patterns in detection of mammographic masses among radiology residents. Mammography is the most widely accepted and utilized screening modality for early breast cancer detection. Providing high quality mammography education to radiology trainees is essential  since excellent interpretation skills are needed to ensure the highest benefit of screening mammography for patients. The authors have previously proposed a computer-aided education system based on trainee models. Those models relate human-assessed image characteristics to trainee error. In this study  the authors propose to build trainee models that utilize features automatically extracted from images using computer vision algorithms to predict likelihood of missing each mass by the trainee. This computer vision-based approach to trainee modeling will allow for automatically searching large databases of mammograms in order to identify challenging cases for each trainee. The authors' algorithm for predicting the likelihood of missing a mass consists of three steps. First  a mammogram is segmented into air  pectoral muscle  fatty tissue  dense tissue  and mass using automated segmentation algorithms. Second  43 features are extracted using computer vision algorithms for each abnormality identified by experts. Third  error-making models (classifiers) are applied to predict the likelihood of trainees missing the abnormality based on the extracted features. The models are developed individually for each trainee using his/her previous reading data. The authors evaluated the predictive performance of the proposed algorithm using data from a reader study in which 10 subjects (7 residents and 3 novices) and 3 experts read 100 mammographic cases. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) methodology was applied for the evaluation. The average area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the error-making models for the task of predicting which masses will be detected and which will be missed was 0.607 (95% CI 0.564-0.650). This value was statistically significantly different from 0.5 (p<0.0001). For the 7 residents only  the AUC performance of the models was 0.590 (95% CI 0.537-0.642) and was also significantly higher than 0.5 (p=0.0009). Therefore  generally the authors' models were able to predict which masses were detected and which were missed better than chance. The authors proposed an algorithm that was able to predict which masses will be detected and which will be missed by each individual trainee. This confirms existence of error-making patterns in the detection of masses among radiology trainees. Furthermore  the proposed methodology will allow for the optimized selection of difficult cases for the trainees in an automatic and efficient manner.
Genomics,,,Radiogenomic analysis of breast cancer: luminal B molecular subtype is associated with enhancement dynamics at MR imaging. To investigate associations between breast cancer molecular subtype and semiautomatically extracted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging features. Imaging and genomic data from the Cancer Genome Atlas and the Cancer Imaging Archive for 48 patients with breast cancer from four institutions in the United States were used in this institutional review board approval-exempt study. Computer vision algorithms were applied to extract 23 imaging features from lesions indicated by a breast radiologist on MR images. Morphologic  textural  and dynamic features were extracted. Molecular subtype was determined on the basis of genomic analysis. Associations between the imaging features and molecular subtype were evaluated by using logistic regression and likelihood ratio tests. The analysis controlled for the age of the patients  their menopausal status  and the orientation of the MR images (sagittal vs axial). There is an association (P = .0015) between the luminal B subtype and a dynamic contrast material-enhancement feature that quantifies the relationship between lesion enhancement and background parenchymal enhancement. Cancers with a higher ratio of lesion enhancement rate to background parenchymal enhancement rate are more likely to be luminal B subtype. The luminal B subtype of breast cancer is associated with MR imaging features that relate the enhancement dynamics of the tumor and the background parenchyma.
Clinical Competence,Internship and Residency,Radiology,Radiology resident mammography training: interpretation difficulty and error-making patterns. The purpose of this study was to better understand the concept of mammography difficulty and how it affects radiology resident performance. Seven radiology residents and three expert breast imagers reviewed 100 mammograms  consisting of bilateral medial lateral oblique and craniocaudal views  using a research workstation. The cases consisted of normal  benign  and malignant findings. Participants identified abnormalities and scored the difficulty and malignant potential for each case. Resident performance (sensitivity  specificity  and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]) was calculated for self- and expert-assessed high and low difficulties. For cases classified by self-assessed difficulty  the resident AUCs were 0.667 for high difficulty and 0.771 for low difficulty cases (P = .010). Resident sensitivities were 0.707 for high and 0.614 for low difficulty cases (P = .113). Resident specificities were 0.583 for high and 0.905 for low difficulty cases (P < .001). For cases classified by expert-assessed difficulty  the resident AUCs were 0.583 for high and 0.783 for low difficulty cases (P = .001). Resident sensitivities were 0.558 for high and 0.796 for low difficulty cases (P < .001). Resident specificities were 0.714 for high and 0.740 for low difficulty cases (P = .807). Increased self- and expert-assessed difficulty is associated with a decrease in resident performance in mammography. However  while this lower performance is due to a decrease in specificity for self-assessed difficulty  it is due to a decrease in sensitivity for expert-assessed difficulty. These trends suggest that educators should provide a mix of self- and expert-assessed difficult cases in educational materials to maximize the effect of training on resident performance and confidence.
Outcome Assessment (Health Care),,,Perioperative outcomes after on- and off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting. Although numerous reports describe the results of off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) at specialized centers and in select patient populations  it remains unclear how off-pump CABG affects real-world patient outcomes. We conducted a large  multicenter observational cohort study of perioperative death and morbidity in on-pump (ON) versus off-pump (OFF) CABG. We reviewed Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Program data for all patients (N=65 097) who underwent isolated CABG from October 1997 through April 2011 (intention-to-treat data were available from 2005 onward). The primary outcome was perioperative (30-day or in-hospital) death; the secondary outcomes were perioperative stroke  dialysis dependence  reoperation for bleeding  mechanical circulatory support  myocardial infarction  ventilator support ≥ 48 hr  and mediastinitis. Propensity scores calculated from age  17 preoperative risk factors  and year of surgery were used to match 8 911 OFF with 26 733 ON patients. In the complete cohort  compared with the ON patients (n=53 468)  the OFF patients (n=11 629) had less perioperative death (2.02% vs 2.53%  P=0.0012) and lower incidences of all morbidities except perioperative myocardial infarction. In the matched cohort  perioperative death did not differ significantly between OFF and ON patients (1.94% vs 2.28%  P=0.06)  but the OFF group had lower incidences of all morbidities except for perioperative myocardial infarction and mediastinitis. A subgroup intention-to-treat analysis yielded similar but smaller outcome differences between the ON and OFF groups. Off-pump CABG might be associated with decreased operative morbidity but did not affect operative death  compared with on-pump CABG. Future studies should examine the effect of off-pump CABG on long-term outcomes.
Epidemiology,,,Alcohol-related breast cancer in postmenopausal women - effect of CYP19A1  PPARG and PPARGC1A polymorphisms on female sex-hormone levels and interaction with alcohol consumption and NSAID usage in a nested case-control study and a randomised controlled trial. Alcohol consumption is associated with increased risk of breast cancer (BC)  and the underlying mechanism is thought to be sex-hormone driven. In vitro and observational studies suggest a mechanism involving peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) in a complex with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-α (PGC-1α) and interaction with aromatase (encoded by CYP19A1). Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) may also affect circulating sex-hormone levels by modifying PPARγ activity. In the present study we assessed whether genetic variation in CYP19A1 is associated with risk of BC in a case-control study group nested within the Danish "Diet  Cancer and Health" cohort (ncases = 687 and ncontrols = 687) and searched for gene-gene interaction between CYP19A1 and PPARGC1A  and CYP19A1 and PPARG  and gene-alcohol and gene-NSAID interactions. Association between the CYP19A1 polymorphisms and hormone levels was also examined among 339 non-HRT users. Incidence rate ratios were calculated based on Cox' proportional hazards model. Furthermore  we performed a pilot randomised controlled trial to determine the effect of the PPARG Pro(12)Ala polymorphism and the PPARγ stimulator Ibuprofen on sex-hormone levels following alcohol intake in postmenopausal women (n = 25) using linear regression. Genetic variations in CYP19A1 were associated with hormone levels (estrone: P rs11070844 = 0.009  estrone sulphate: P rs11070844 = 0.01  P rs749292 = 0.004  P rs1062033 = 0.007 and P rs10519297 = 0.03  and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG): P rs3751591 = 0.03) and interacted with alcohol intake in relation to hormone levels (estrone sulphate: P interaction/rs2008691 = 0.02 and P interaction/rs1062033= 0.03  and SHBG: P interaction/rs11070844 = 0.03). CYP19A1/rs3751591 was both associated with SHBG levels (P = 0.03) and with risk of BC (Incidence Rate Ratio = 2.12; 95 % Confidence Interval: 1.02-4.43) such that homozygous variant allele carriers had increased levels of serum SHBG and were at increased risk of BC. Acute intake of alcohol decreased blood estrone (P = <0.0001)  estrone sulphate (P = <0.0001)  and SHBG (P = 0.009) levels  whereas Ibuprofen intake and PPARG Pro(12)Ala genotype had no effect on hormone levels. Our results suggest that genetically determined variation in CYP19A1 is associated with differences in sex hormone levels. However  the genetically determined differences in sex hormone levels were not convincingly associated with BC risk. The results therefore indicate that the genetically determined variation in CYP19A1 contributes little to BC risk and to alcohol-mediated BC risk. NCT02463383  June 3  2015.
Metabolomics,,,Progressive Changes in the Plasma Metabolome during Malnutrition in Juvenile Pigs. Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) is one of the leading nutrition-related causes of death in children under five years of age. The clinical features of SAM are well documented  but a comprehensive understanding of the development from a normal physiological state to SAM is lacking. Characterizing the temporal metabolomic change may help to understand the disease progression and to define nutritional rehabilitation strategies. Using a piglet model we hypothesized that a progressing degree of malnutrition induces marked plasma metabolite changes. Four-week-old weaned pigs were fed a nutrient-deficient maize diet (MAL) or nutritionally optimized reference diet (REF) for 7 weeks. Plasma collected weekly was subjected to LC-MS for a nontargeted profiling of metabolites with abundance differentiation. The MAL pigs showed markedly reduced body-weight gain and lean-mass proportion relative to the REF pigs. Levels of eight essential and four nonessential amino acids showed a time-dependent deviation in the MAL pigs from that in the REF. Choline metabolites and gut microbiomic metabolites generally showed higher abundance in the MAL pigs. The results demonstrated that young malnourished pigs had a profoundly perturbed metabolism  and this provides basic knowledge about metabolic changes during malnourishment  which may be of help in designing targeted therapeutic foods for refeeding malnourished children.
Metabolomics,,,Forecasting individual breast cancer risk using plasma metabolomics and biocontours. Breast cancer is a major cause of death for women. To improve treatment  current oncology research focuses on discovering and validating new biomarkers for early detection of cancer; so far with limited success. Metabolic profiling of plasma samples and auxiliary lifestyle information was combined by chemometric data fusion. It was possible to create a biocontour  which we define as a complex pattern of relevant biological and phenotypic information. While single markers or known risk factors have close to no predictive value  the developed biocontour provides a forecast which  several years before diagnosis  is on par with how well most current biomarkers can diagnose current cancer. Hence  while e.g. mammography can diagnose current cancer with a sensitivity and specificity of around 75 %  the currently developed biocontour can predict that there is an increased risk that breast cancer will develop in a subject 2-5 years after the sample is taken with sensitivity and specificity well above 80 %. The model was built on data obtained in 1993-1996 and tested on persons sampled a year later in 1997. Metabolic forecasting of cancer by biocontours opens new possibilities for early prediction of individual cancer risk and thus for efficient screening. This may provide new avenues for research into disease mechanisms.
Epidemiology,,,Determinants of dietary supplement use--healthy individuals use dietary supplements. The prevalence of dietary supplement use varies largely among populations  and previous studies have indicated that it is high in the Danish population compared with other European countries. The diversity in supplement use across countries indicates that cultural and environmental factors could influence the use of dietary supplements. Only few studies investigating the use of dietary supplements have been conducted in the Danish population. The present cross-sectional study is based on 54 948 Danes  aged 50-64 years  who completed self-administrated questionnaires on diet  dietary supplements and lifestyle between 1993 and 1997. A health index including smoking  physical activity  alcohol and diet  and a metabolic risk index including waist circumference  urinary glucose and measured hypertension were constructed. Logistic regression was used to investigate these determinants in relation to the intake of dietary supplements. We found that 71 % of the participants were dietary supplement users; female sex  older age groups and higher educated participants were more likely to be users of any dietary supplements. One additional point in the health index was associated with 19  16 and 9 % higher likelihood of being user of any  more common and less common supplements  respectively. In the metabolic risk index  one additional point was associated with 17 and 16 % lower likelihood of being user of any supplement and more common supplements  respectively. No significant association was found for less common supplement use. In conclusion  those with the healthiest lifestyle were more likely to use dietary supplements. Thus  lifestyle and dietary composition should be considered as confounders on supplement use and health outcomes.
Research Design,,,Lung cancer in HIV patients and their parents: a Danish cohort study. HIV patients are known to be at increased risk of lung cancer but the risk factors behind this are unclear. We estimated the cumulative incidence and relative risk of lung cancer in 1) a population of all Danish HIV patients identified from the Danish HIV Cohort Study (n = 5 053) and a cohort of population controls matched on age and gender (n = 50 530) (study period; 1995 - 2009) and 2) their parents (study period; 1969 - 2009). Mortality and relative risk of death after a diagnosis of lung cancer was estimated in both populations. 29 (0.6%) HIV patients vs. 183 (0.4%) population controls were diagnosed with lung cancer in the observation period. HIV patients had an increased risk of lung cancer (adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR); 2.38 (95% CI; 1.61 - 3.53)). The IRR was considerably increased in HIV patients who were smokers or former smokers (adjusted IRR; 4.06 (95% CI; 2.66 - 6.21))  male HIV patients with heterosexual route of infection (adjusted IRR; 4.19 (2.20 - 7.96)) and HIV patients with immunosuppression (adjusted IRR; 3.25 (2.01 - 5.24)). Both fathers and mothers of HIV patients had an increased risk of lung cancer (adjusted IRR for fathers; 1.31 (95% CI: 1.09 - 1.58)  adjusted IRR for mothers 1.35 (95% CI: 1.07 - 1.70)). Mortality after lung cancer diagnose was increased in HIV patients (adjusted mortality rate ratio 2.33 (95%CI; 1.51 - 3.61)  but not in the parents. All HIV patients diagnosed with lung cancer were smokers or former smokers. The risk was especially increased in HIV patients who were smokers or former smokers  heterosexually infected men or immunosuppressed. HIV appears to be a marker of behavioural or family related risk factors that affect the incidence of lung cancer in HIV patients.
Genetics  Population,,,Phenotypes and genotypes for CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 in a black Tanzanian population. CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 are polymorphically expressed enzymes that show marked interindividual and interethnic variation. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of the defective alleles in CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 in Africans and to test whether the genotype for CYP2C19 is better correlated with the proguanil/cylcoguanil ratio than the mephenytoin S/R ratio. Two hundred and sixteen black Tanzanians were phenotyped for CYP2D6 with the use of sparteine  and for CYP2C19 with the use of mephenytoin and proguanil. Of these 196 subjects were also genotyped for CYP2D6 (including the CYP2D6*1  CYP2D6*3 and CYP2D6*4 alleles) and 195 were genotyped for CYP2C19 (including the CYP2C19*1  CYP2C19*2 and the CYP2C19*3 alleles). Furthermore 100 subjects were examined for the allele duplication in CYP2D6  leading to ultrarapid metabolism  with long PCR. The sparteine metabolic ratio (MR) was statistically significantly higher in the Tanzanian group of homozygous  extensive metabolizers compared to a historical control group of white Danish extensive metabolizers. Only one poor metabolizer for CYP2D6 (MR=124 and genotype CYP2D6*1/CYP2D6*4 ) was found. The gene frequencies were 0.96 for the CYP2D6*1 allele and 0.04 for the CYP2D6*4 allele. No CYP2D6*3 alleles were found. Nine subjects had an allele duplication in CYP2D6 (9%). For CYP2C19 there were seven subjects (3. 6%) who were phenotyped as poor metabolizers  but only three subjects (1.5%) had a genotype (CYP2C19*2/CYP2C19*2 ) indicative of poor metabolism. The gene frequencies were 0.90 for the CYP2C19*1 allele and 0.10 for the CYP2C19*2 allele. No CYP2C19*3 alleles were found. The mephenytoin S/R ratios were not bimodally distributed. Both the genotyping and phenotyping results show that there is a substantial difference between an African black population and a Caucasian population in the capacity to metabolize drugs via CYP2D6 and CYP2C19.
Anesthesiology,,,Guidelines to the Practice of Anesthesia - Revised Edition 2017. The Guidelines to the Practice of Anesthesia Revised Edition 2017 (the guidelines) were prepared by the Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society (CAS)  which reserves the right to determine their publication and distribution. Because the guidelines are subject to revision  updated versions are published annually. The Guidelines to the Practice of Anesthesia Revised Edition 2017 supersedes all previously published versions of this document. Although the CAS encourages Canadian anesthesiologists to adhere to its practice guidelines to ensure high-quality patient care  the society cannot guarantee any specific patient outcome. Each anesthesiologist should exercise his or her own professional judgement in determining the proper course of action for any patient's circumstances. The CAS assumes no responsibility or liability for any error or omission arising from the use of any information contained in its Guidelines to the Practice of Anesthesia.
Epidemiology,,,Association between aortic valve calcification measured on non-contrast computed tomography and aortic valve stenosis in the general population. Aortic valve calcification (AVC) measured on non-contrast computed tomography (CT) has shown correlation to severity of aortic valve stenosis (AS) and mortality in patients with known AS. The aim of this study was to determine the association of CT verified AVC and subclinical AS in a general population undergoing CT. CT scans from 566 randomly selected male participants (age 65-74) in the Danish cardiovascular screening study (DANCAVAS) were analyzed for AVC. All participants with a moderately or severely increased AVC score (≥300 arbitrary units (AU)) and a matched control group were invited for a supplementary echocardiography. AS was graded by indexed aortic valve area (AVAi) on echocardiography as moderate 0.6-0.85 cm(2)/m(2) and severe < 0.6 cm(2)/m(2)  respectively. ROC- and regression analyses were performed. Due to prior valve surgery  and artifacts from ICD leads 16 individuals were excluded from the AVC scoring. Moderate or severe increased AVC was observed in 10.7% (95% CI: 8.4-13.7). Echocardiography was performed in 101 individuals; 32.7% (95% CI: 21.8 to 46.0) with moderate or high AVC score had moderate or severe AS  while none with no or low AVC. A ROC analysis defined an AVC score ≥588 AU to be suggestive of moderate or severe AS (AUC 0.89 ± 0.04  sensitivity 83% and specificity 87%). In the univariate analyses  AVC was the only variable significantly associated with AS. This study indicates an association between CT verified AVC and subclinical AS.
Food Microbiology,,,Rising methods and leavening agents used in the production of bread do not impact the glycaemic index. The aim of this study was to compare the glycaemic index of breads produced using different rising methods and leavening agents. Eleven bread varieties were selected based on method of production  and divided between three groups of ten participants (mean +/- SD age 30.0 +/- 10.7 years and BMI 22.9 +/- 2.8). Standard glycaemic index testing protocol was implemented after an overnight fast  using glucose as the reference food  and collecting blood samples over a two-hour period. Glycemic index was calculated using the usual method. Additionally  incremental area under the curve data were log transformed and glycaemic index was calculated using regression analysis. Mean glycaemic index values of the breads in ascending order were as follows: Swiss Rye; 60  Long oat; 68  Sourdough+oats; 71  Long rye; 76  Short oat; 77  Short whole meal; 78  Long whole meal; 80  Sourdough; 82  Short rye; 82  Yeast; 88  and Desem; 92. There were significant differences in mean glycaemic index values between Swiss Rye and Yeast (p = 0.010)  Swiss Rye and Desem (p = 0.007) and Sourdough+oats and Desem (p = 0.043). The rising method and leavening agents used in this study did not impact on the glycaemic index of the breads tested. Other factors  such as increased bread density  and the addition of whole grains may be required to produce bread with a low glycaemic index.
Parasitology,,,In vitro cultivation of Maritrema novaezealandensis (Microphallidae): the effect of culture medium on excystation  survival and egg production. In this study  the effect of the composition of culture medium on excystation  growth  survival and egg production was investigated for the recently discovered microphallid trematode Maritrema novaezealandensis. Metacercariae from the two second intermediate crab hosts  Macrophthalmus hirtipes and Halicarcinus whitei  were incubated in either: (1) 0.85% saline solution  (2) the commercial cell culture medium  NCTC-109  (3) NCTC-109 supplemented with 20%  or (4) NCTC-109 supplemented with 40% chicken serum. Furthermore  excysted metacercariae were cultured for 5 days in each of the three media: NCTC-109 and NCTC-109 supplemented with 20% or 40% chicken serum. Excystment was rapid for all media used in the experiment. However  metacercariae in 0.85% saline solution had a significantly lower excystment rate over the first 4 h of incubation compared to the other media. Egg production was highest in specimens cultured in media with a supplement of chicken serum and reached a maximum after 2 days of cultivation. Growth  however  did not occur after the first day of cultivation in any of the three media.
Outcome Assessment (Health Care),,,Is a targeted intensive intervention effective for improvements in hypertension control? A randomized controlled trial. High blood pressure (BP) is one of the most important risk factors for stroke  and antihypertensive therapy significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However  achieving a regulated BP in hypertensive patients is still a challenge. To evaluate the impact of an intervention targeting GPs' management of hypertension. A cluster randomized trial comprising 124 practices and 2646 patients with hypertension. In the Capital Region of Denmark  the participating GPs were randomized to an intensive or to a moderately intensive intervention group or to a control group and in Region Zealand and Region of Southern Denmark  practices were randomized into a moderately intensive intervention and to a control group. The main outcome measures were change in proportion of patients with high BP and change in systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) from the first to the second registration. The proportion of patients with high BP in 2007 was reduced in 2009 by ~9% points. The mean SBP was reduced significantly from 2007 to 2009 by 3.61 mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI): -4.26 to -2.96]  and the DBP was reduced significantly by 1.99 mmHg (95% CI: -2.37 to -1.61). There was no additional impact in either of the intervention groups. There was no impact of the moderate intervention and no additional impact of the intensive intervention on BP.
Family Practice,Internal Medicine,,[Can emergency admissions to departments of internal medicine be replaced by planned admissions?]. The aim of the study was to describe the pattern of admissions to a medical department and to analyse how far acute admissions can be replaced by planned subacute admissions to an outpatient department. All acute admissions to the medical department during two six-day periods were registered. The department's registrars filled in a structured questionnaire and the senior registrars evaluated the admissions. In addition  a local general practitioner evaluated one-third of the admissions. Altogether  214 consecutive patients were entered in the study. One-third of the patients had consulted their GP in the week before the admission. Admissions from the casualty department and from GPs were assessed as appropriate in 92% and 71% of the cases  respectively. The senior registrars assessed that 17-20% of the acute admissions could have been replaced by a subacute  planned admission. Only 5% of the patients shared this conclusion. The ability to predict the total length of stay was limited  and greatest accuracy was achieved in prediction of short-term stays. In a medical department with many acute admissions  it is possible to replace acute admissions with planned subacute admissions for a large group of patients.
Forensic Toxicology,Pharmacology  Clinical,Specialization,Clinical Pharmacology in Denmark in 2016 - 40 Years with the Danish Society of Clinical Pharmacology and 20 Years as a Medical Speciality. The Danish Society of Clinical Pharmacology was founded in 1976  and mainly thanks to the persistent efforts of the society  clinical pharmacology became an independent medical speciality in Denmark in 1996. Since then  clinical pharmacology has gone from strength to strength. In the Danish healthcare system  clinical pharmacology has established itself as an indispensible part of the efforts to promote the rational  safe and economic use of drugs. Clinical pharmacologists are active in drug committees both in hospitals and in the primary sector. All clinical pharmacology centres offer a local medicines information service. Some centres have established an adverse drug effect manager function. Only one centre offers a therapeutic drug monitoring service. Clinical pharmacologists are responsible for the toxicological advice at the Danish Poison Information Centre at Bispebjerg University Hospital in the Capital Region. The Department of Clinical Pharmacology at Aarhus University Hospital works closely together with forensic toxicologists and pathologists  covering issues regarding illicit substances  forensic pharmacology  post-mortem toxicology  expert testimony and research. Therapeutic geriatric and psychiatric teach-inns for specialist and junior doctors are among the newest initiatives organized by clinical pharmacologists. Clinical pharmacologists work also in the Danish Medicines Agency and in the Danish pharmaceutical industry  and the latter has in particular a great growth potential for creating new jobs and career opportunities for clinical pharmacologists. As of July 2016  the Danish Society of Clinical Pharmacology has 175 members  and 70 of these are specialists in clinical pharmacology corresponding to approximately 2.5 specialists per 1000 doctors (Denmark has in total 28 000 doctors) or approximately 12 specialists per one million inhabitants.
Regenerative Medicine,,,Safety and Potential Effect of a Single Intracavernous Injection of Autologous Adipose-Derived Regenerative Cells in Patients with Erectile Dysfunction Following Radical Prostatectomy: An Open-Label Phase I Clinical Trial. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men  and radical prostatectomy (RP) often results in erectile dysfunction (ED) and a substantially reduced quality of life. The efficacy of current interventions  principal treatment with PDE-5 inhibitors  is not satisfactory and this condition presents an unmet medical need. Preclinical studies using adipose-derived stem cells to treat ED have shown promising results. Herein  we report the results of a human phase 1 trial with autologous adipose-derived regenerative cells (ADRCs) freshly isolated after a liposuction. Seventeen men suffering from post RP ED  with no recovery using conventional therapy  were enrolled in a prospective phase 1 open-label and single-arm study. All subjects had RP performed 5-18 months before enrolment  and were followed for 6 months after intracavernosal transplantation. ADRCs were analyzed for the presence of stem cell surface markers  viability and ability to differentiate. Primary endpoint was the safety and tolerance of the cell therapy while the secondary outcome was improvement of erectile function. Any adverse events were reported and erectile function was assessed by IIEF-5 scores. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov  NCT02240823. Intracavernous injection of ADRCs was well-tolerated and only minor events related to the liposuction and cell injections were reported at the one-month evaluation  but none at later time points. Overall during the study period  8 of 17 men recovered their erectile function and were able to accomplish sexual intercourse. Post-hoc stratification according to urinary continence status was performed. Accordingly  for continent men (median IIEFinclusion = 7 (95% CI 5-12)  8 out of 11 men recovered erectile function (IIEF6months = 17 (6-23))  corresponding to a mean difference of 0.57 (0.38-0.85; p = 0.0069)  versus inclusion. In contrast  incontinent men did not regain erectile function (median IIEF1/3/6 months = 5 (95% CI 5-6); mean difference 1 (95% CI 0.85-1.18)  p > 0.9999). In this phase I trial a single intracavernosal injection of freshly isolated autologous ADRCs was a safe procedure. A potential efficacy is suggested by a significant improvement in IIEF-5 scores and erectile function. We suggest that ADRCs represent a promising interventional therapy of ED following prostatectomy. Danish Medical Research Council  Odense University Hospital and the Danish Cancer Society.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Premedication in ambulatory surgery]. A substantive amendment to this systematic review was last made on 3 January 2000. Cochrane reviews are regularly checked and updated if necessary. To assess the effect of anxiolytic remedication on time to discharge in adult patients undergoing day case surgery under general anaesthesia. Trials were identified by computerised searches of the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register  MEDLINE  EMBASE  by checking the reference lists of trials and review articles  by handsearching three main anaesthesia journals and by contacting five researchers active in the field and the Product Information departments of the manufactures of five commonly used premedicants. All randomised controlled trials comparing an anxiolytic drug(s) with placebo before general anaesthesia in adult day case surgical patients. We collected data on anaesthetic drugs used  results of tests of psychomotor function where these were used to assess residual effect of premedication  and on times from end of anaesthesia to ability to walk unaided or readiness for discharge from hospital. Formal statistical synthesis of individual trials was not performed in view of the variety of drugs studied. Searching identified twenty-nine reports; fourteen studies  with data from a total of 1263 patients  were considered eligible for analysis. Only two studies specifically addressed the discharge question; both found no delay in premedicated patients. Three other studies used clinical criteria to assess fitness for discharge  though times were not given. Again  there was no difference from placebo. Four studies used both clinical measures and tests of psychomotor function as tests of recovery from anaesthesia. In none of these studies did the premedication appear to delay discharge  although performance on tests of psychomotor function was sometimes still impaired. Of the four studies which used tests of psychomotor function to assess recovery  three showed impaired recovery (after midazolam 7.5 mg  midazolam 15 mg or diazepam 15 mg) which might possibly interfere with discharge from hospital. We have found no evidence of a difference in time to discharge from hospital in patients who received anxiolytic premedication. However  in view of the age and variety of anaesthetic techniques used  inferences for current day-case practice should be made with caution.
Education,,,Building a community of practice in rural medical education: growing our own together. This article chronicles the rise  decline  and recent resurgence of rural training track residency programs (RTTs) in the USA over the past 30 years and the emergence of a healthy community of practice in rural medical education. This has occurred during a time in the USA when federal and state funding of graduate medical education has been relatively stagnant and the rules around finance and accreditation of rural programs have been challenging. Many of the early family residency programs developed in the 1970s included a curricular focus on rural practice. However  by the 1980s  these programs were not yet producing the desired numbers of rural physicians. In response  in 1986  Maudlin and others at the family medicine residency in Spokane developed the first 1-2 RTT in Colville  Washington. In the 1990s  and by 2000  early news of success led to a peak of 35 active programs. However  over the next decade these programs experienced significant hardship due to a lack of funding and a general decline in student interest in family medicine. By 2010  only 25 programs remained.<b> </b>In 2010  in an effort to sustain the 1-2 RTT as a national strategy in training physicians for rural practice  a federally funded consortium of individuals and programs established the RTT Technical Assistance program (RTT TA). Building on the pattern of peer support and collaboration set by earlier groups  the RTT TA consortium expanded the existing community of practice in rural medical education in support of RTTs. In-person meetings  peer consultation and visitation  coordinated efforts at student recruitment  and collaborative rural medical education research were all elements of the consortium's strategy. Rather than anchoring its efforts in medical schools or hospitals  this consortium engaged as partners a wider variety of stakeholders. This included physician educators still living and practicing in rural communities ('local experts')  rural medical educator peers  program directors  professional groups  academic units  governmental entities such as state offices of rural health  and national associations with a stake in rural medical education. The consortium has succeeded in (1) supporting established and new RTTs  (2) increasing medical student interest in these programs  and (3) demonstrating the effectiveness of this strategy through a minimum dataset and registry of RTT trainees. From a low of 21 programs in 2012  the number has grown to 32  accounting for a total of 68 positions in each year of training. The RTT Collaborative  the non-profit that has emerged as the sustainable product of that federal funding  is now supported by a national cooperative of participating rural programs and continues the work. Growing a community of practice in this fashion requires the organic building of relationships over time. The RTT TA consortium  and now the RTT Collaborative as a sustainable successor  have laid a strong foundation for community-engaged rural health professions education into the future - from each growing their own  to 'growing our own … together.
Fiber Optic Technology,Microscopy,,High energy supercontinuum sources using tapered photonic crystal fibers for multispectral photoacoustic microscopy. We demonstrate a record bandwidth high energy supercontinuum source suitable for multispectral photoacoustic microscopy. The source has more than 150  nJ/10  nm bandwidth over a spectral range of 500 to 1600 nm. This performance is achieved using a carefully designed fiber taper with large-core input for improved power handling and small-core output that provides the desired spectral range of the supercontinuum source.
Epidemiology,,,Long-term residential road traffic noise and NO2 exposure in relation to risk of incident myocardial infarction - A Danish cohort study. Road traffic is a source of both air pollution and noise; two environmental hazards both found to increase the risk of ischemic heart disease. Given the high correlation between these pollutants  it is important to investigate combined effects  in relation to myocardial infarction (MI). Among 50 744 middle-aged Danes enrolled into the Diet  Cancer and Health cohort from 1993 to 97  we identified 2403 cases of incident MI during a median follow-up of 14.5 years. Present and historical residential addresses from 1987 to 2011 were found in national registries  and traffic noise (Lden) and air pollution (NO2) were modelled for all addresses. Analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard models. Road traffic noise and NO2 were both individually associated with a higher risk of MI  with hazard ratios of 1.14 (1.07-1.21) and 1.08 (1.03-1.12) per inter-quartile range higher 10-year mean of road traffic noise and NO2  respectively. Mutual exposure adjustment reduced the association with 10-year NO2 exposure (1.02 (0.96-1.08))  whereas the association with road traffic noise remained: 1.12 (1.03-1.21). For fatal incident MI  the pattern was similar  but the associations for both pollutants were stronger. In analyses of tertiles across both pollutants  the strongest effects were seen for combined medium/high exposure  especially for fatal MI's. Both road traffic noise and NO2 were associated with a higher risk of MI in single-pollutant models. In two-pollutant models  mainly noise was associated with MI. Combined exposure to both pollutants was associated with the highest risk.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Uncertain evidence for effect of medication reviews of the prescriptions for elderly patients]. Elderly patients are often prescribed several drugs  which might increase the risk of drug-related harms and the risk of not using the drugs as prescribed  both of which can result in increased costs. The literature supports the conclusions in a newly published Cocranereview on four randomized controlled trials (RCT) showing that it is uncertain whether medication reviews reduce mortality or hospital readmissions  but medication reviews seem to reduce emergency department contacts. However  further RCT are needed before implementing medication reviews.
Clinical Competence,Education  Medical  Graduate,Educational Measurement,[Video recordings can be used for easier and faster evaluations of the performances of postgraduate trainees]. Evaluating post-graduate trainees under direct observation is troublesome  and there are concerns about rater-variability. The aim of this study was to explore if video recordings could be used for evaluation. The performances of five trainees were video recorded. The videos were assessed by six supervisors watching either the complete recording or approximately 20 min. Video recording was well tolerated by the patients and the supervisors  but not the trainees. Watching part of the videos was sufficient for assessment. Video recording seems to provide a feasible method of assessing postgraduate trainees.
Curriculum,Education  Medical  Continuing,Education  Medical  Graduate,[Evidence-based pedagogical principles used at medical specialist workshop]. How should a theoretical postgraduate course be organized to obtain maximum effect? We report an example of a two-day course planned and implemented according to educational approaches previously shown to be effective. The theme of the course is "The old patient"  and the course is compulsory for residents in internal medicine. This case study showed that the methods used were feasible  and the participants gained knowledge. A multiple-choice test before and after the course showed 44% (before) and 64% (after) correct answers  p < 0.001.
Pharmacoepidemiology,,,Increased use of antidepressants at the end of life: population-based study among people aged 65 years and above. The new antidepressants are generally effective and safe for older people  but may have serious side-effects. The use has been rapidly increasing  but focus on upper age groups has been limited. The pattern of antidepressant use as death approaches has never been analysed. To analyse the use of antidepressants among individuals aged 65 years and above with respect to time trends  age and proximity to death. Population-based prescription study. The County of Funen  Denmark  1992-2004 (approximately 470 000 inhabitants). The 1-year prevalence of antidepressants increases steadily over time in all age groups. Among the 65+ year-olds it also increases with age and differs substantially between the youngest and the oldest. Very high prevalences are observed: 26.8% among females 85-89 years old and 17.5% among males 85 years and above in 2004. In all age groups the use of antidepressants increases substantially with proximity to death in the last 3 years of life. In the last phase of life the use is independent of whether the patient dies at age 65 or 90 about 33% of females and 25% of males receive antidepressants in the last 6 months. The use of antidepressants among 65+ year-olds increases with age and proximity to death to very high levels. Future studies may clarify the problems and diagnoses giving rise to the use of antidepressants for such a large proportion of older people  and especially the problems giving rise to treatment as death approaches.
Family Practice,,,Early discontinuation of antidepressants in general practice: association with patient and prescriber characteristics. Most antidepressant treatment is initiated and continued in general practice but  despite current guidelines  treatment duration is often short among patients with depression. Discontinuation may  however  be caused by a complexity of factors  but so far research has focused on drug effects  adverse effects and drug regimens. Our aim was to analyse whether early discontinuation of first-time antidepressant treatment in general practice may be predicted by (i) social position and psychiatric history of the patient; and (ii) demography  practice activity and the general prescribing behaviour of the GP. Early discontinuation  i.e. that patients do not purchase antidepressants in the 6 months following first prescription  was analysed using established databases. Among patients presenting in 174 general practices in Funen County  Denmark  4860 adult first-time users of antidepressants were identified (regardless of diagnosis). The inclusion period was January 1998-June 1999. One in three patients did not purchase antidepressants in the 6 months following first prescription  but rates were higher among those prescribed tricyclic compared with new generation antidepressants. Patients' age and sex did not have an influence  but early discontinuation was more frequent among patients of low socio-economic status and patients prescribed in practices characterized by high prescribing rates. No association with psychiatric history was observed. Early discontinuation is frequent in general practice  and patients of low social status are at greater risk. Adherence-promoting strategies should pay attention to the high prescribing doctors. Further studies may answer the question of whether the association between doctors' prescribing behaviour and early discontinuation is a feature specific to antidepressants or a more general phenomenon.
Geriatric Nursing,Geriatrics,,[Treatment with antidepressants in geriatric departments. Occurrence and record keeping]. The aim of the present study was to describe the occurrence of antidepressant treatment in geriatric departments in Denmark and assess the notes of the patient records in connection with prescription. Patient records for consecutively referred patients in seven geriatric departments were examined and basic information was noted. For users of antidepressants further information about the treatment was noted. A total of 1211 patients records were examined and out of these 338 patients were in treatment with antidepressants (29.7%). The users of antidepressants used more drugs on their discharge from the hospital. For 61.8% (209/338) of the users the treatment had started before the admission and in more than three-fourths the treatment remained unchanged at their discharge  in 9% the treatment was discontinued. 38.2% (129/338) started their treatment during the admission. Depression was stated as being the main reason in 54% of those who continued an ongoing treatment  and in 78% of those who started their treatment during admission. In 98.4%  the beginning of treatment with antidepressants was based upon the file notes. In 34.8% of the records of ongoing treatment no file notes were given. Treatment with antidepressants is common in geriatric departments and most often it is a question of continuation of a treatment that had started before the admission. The study shows that there is a need for an optimization of the file notes.
Outcome Assessment (Health Care),,,Identifying the concepts contained in outcome measures of clinical trials on four internal disorders using the International Classification of Functioning  Disability and Health as a reference. To systematically identify and compare the concepts contained in outcome measures of clinical trials on chronic ischaemic heart disease  diabetes mellitus  obesity  and obstructive pulmonary disease  including asthma using the International Classification of Functioning  Disability and Health (ICF) as a reference. Randomized controlled trials between 1993 and 2003 were located in MEDLINE and selected according predefined criteria. The outcome measures were extracted and the concepts contained in the outcome measures were linked to the ICF. 166 trials on chronic ischaemic heart disease  227 trials on diabetes mellitus  428 trials on obesity  and 253 trials on obstructive pulmonary disease were included. Ten different health status questionnaires (fulfilling the inclusion criteria) were extracted in chronic ischaemic heart disease  19 in diabetes mellitus  47 in obesity  and 39 in obstructive pulmonary disease. Across conditions at least 75% (range 75-92%) of the extracted concepts could be linked to the ICF. In diabetes mellitus and obesity the most used ICF categories were general metabolic functions (b540)  in obstructive pulmonary disease respiration functions (b440) and in chronic ischaemic heart disease heart functions (b410). In all 4 health conditions the majority of studies were drug trials focusing on clinically relevant parameters and not on functioning. The ICF provides a useful reference to identify and quantify the concepts contained in outcome assessment used in clinical trials.
Metabolomics,,,Untargeted assignment and automatic integration of (1)H NMR metabolomic datasets using a multivariate curve resolution approach. In this article  we propose the use of the Multivariate Curve Resolution - Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS) chemometrics method to resolve the (1)H NMR spectra and concentration of the individual metabolites in their mixtures in untargeted metabolomics studies. A decision tree-based strategy is presented to optimally select and implement spectra estimates and equality constraints during MCR-ALS optimization. The proposed method has been satisfactorily evaluated using different (1)H NMR metabolomics datasets. In a first study  (1)H NMR spectra of the metabolites in a simulated mixture were successfully recovered and assigned. In a second study  more than 30 metabolites were characterized and quantified from an experimental unknown mixture analyzed by (1)H NMR. In this work  MCR-ALS is shown to be a convenient tool for metabolite investigation and sample screening using (1)H NMR  and it opens a new path for performing metabolomics studies with this chemometric technique.
Epidemiology,,,Rationale and design of a multicenter  international and collaborative Coronary Artery Aneurysm Registry (CAAR). Coronary artery aneurysm is defined as a coronary dilation that exceeds the diameter of adjacent segments or the diameter of the patient's largest normal coronary vessel by 1.5×. It is an uncommon disease that has been diagnosed with increasing frequency since the widespread appearance of coronary angiography. The published incidence varies from 1.5% to 5%  suggesting male dominance and a predilection for the right coronary artery. Although several causes have been described  atherosclerosis accounts for ≥50% of coronary aneurysms in adults. Reported complications include thrombosis and distal embolization  rupture  and vasospasm  causing ischemia  heart failure  or arrhythmias. The natural history and prognosis remain unknown  as definitive data are scarce. Controversies persist regarding the use of medical management (antithrombotic therapy) or interventional/surgical procedures. Only some case reports or small case series are available about this condition. The Coronary Artery Aneurysm Registry (CAAR; http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02563626) is a multicenter international ambispective registry that aims to provide insights on anatomic  epidemiologic  and clinical aspects of this substantially unknown entity. In addition  the registry will assess management strategies (conservative  interventional  or surgical) and their short- and long-term results in a large cohort of patients. ClinicalTrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT02563626.
Food Microbiology,,,Purification and characterization of a branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase from Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei CHCC 2115. Purification and characterization of an aminotransferase (AT) specific for the degradation of branched-chain amino acids from Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei CHCC 2115. The purification protocol consisted of anion exchange chromatography  affinity chromatography and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. The enzyme was found to exist as a monomer with a molecular mass of 40-50 kDa. The AT converted isoleucine  leucine and valine at a similar rate with alpha-ketoglutarate as the amino group acceptor; minor activity was shown for methionine. The enzyme had pH and temperature optima of 7.3 and 43 degrees C  respectively  and activity was detected at the pH and salt conditions found in cheese (pH 5.2  4% NaCl). Hg2+ completely inhibited the enzyme  and the inhibition pattern was similar to that for pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent enzymes  when studying the effect of other metal ions  thiol- and carbonyl-binding agents. The N-terminal sequence of the enzyme was SVNIDWNNLGFDYMQLPYRYVAHXKDGVXD  and had at the amino acid level  60 and 53% identity to a branched-chain amino acid AT of Lact. plantarum and Lactococcus lactis  respectively. The results suggest that Lact. paracasei subsp. paracasei CHCC 2115 may contribute to development of flavour in cheese. The findings of this work contribute to the knowledge of transamination performed by cheese-related bacteria  and in the understanding and control of amino acid catabolism and the production of aroma compounds.
Pediatrics,,,Use of complementary/alternative medicine among paediatric patients. The use of complementary/alternative medicine (CAM) is increasing. The aim was to characterise the use of CAM among patients in a paediatric department. All patients (aged 0-18 years)  out-patients or hospitalised  in contact with the Department of Paediatrics  Odense University Hospital during a 2 week period in the autumn of 2001 were asked to participate. In total  622 (92%) patients participated. The data were collected in an interviewer administered questionnaire during a short structured interview with the patient and parents. CAM was divided into herbal medicine (herbal drugs or dietary supplements) (HM)  alternative therapy (AT) (i.e. acupuncture) or chiropractic (CHI). Of all patients  53% had tried CAM at least once and 23% had tried CAM within the last month (15% HM  7% AT and 2% CHI). There was no correlation between use of CAM and gender  age or if the patient was out-patient or hospitalised. The users were pre-school children. HM (Bio-Strath and Echinacea) was especially used to strengthen the immune system. Among AT  reflexological treatment was the most popular treatment. The most frequent users of CAM were patients with asthma  eczema or allergy plus patients suffering from gastrointestinal diseases or hospitalised for observation. More than 50% of the users experienced positive effects and 6% had side-effects from AM. Of the CAM users  11% or 2% of the total paediatric population used CAM instead of conventional medicines. Of the paediatric patients  53% had tried complementary/alternative medicine  which was used as a supplement to conventional medicine although we did not know how long it was used. Paediatric patients should be interviewed about their use of complementary/alternative medicine with regard to side-effects  interactions or lack of compliance with conventional medicine.
Qualitative Research,,,Struggling at work--a qualitative study of working Danes with depressive symptoms. Little is known on how employees at work with mental health problems experience their work environment. This study explores how a selected sample of Danish employees with depressive symptoms experience the interaction with their work environment and how they respond to and deal with problems at work. From a survey study on work and mental health in Denmark  we invited participants for in-depth interviews. Using grounded theory  we conducted 13 semi structured interviews with employees  at work  experiencing depressive symptoms. Work was pivotal for the informants who were in an on-going process that we conceptualised as struggling at work. Informants struggled with the negative experiences of work that led to emotional  cognitive and somatic symptoms. Relationships with supervisors and colleagues  work load and work pressure and their self-image as a good worker conditioned the struggle. The informants found themselves unable to change their problematic working situation. This gradually led to different strategies to endure work and take care of one-self. These strategies were as follows: tending to symptoms and altering prospects for their future. The consequence of the on-going struggle was that the informants distanced themselves from their work. This study provided insight to the process of struggling at work  which the interviewed employees with depressive symptoms experienced. Behaviour of supervisors is a key element for employees with depressive symptoms struggling at work. Practitioners and other health and rehabilitation practitioners working with people with depressive symptoms and other mental health problems could inquire about supervisor's behaviour and relation between supervisors and employees. Interventions that targets both the individual employee as well as work environment focused interventions at the organisational level could be beneficial for employees with mental health problems as well as the workplaces.
Biotechnology,,,Microbial Synthesis of the Forskolin Precursor Manoyl Oxide in an Enantiomerically Pure Form. Forskolin is a promising medicinal compound belonging to a plethora of specialized plant metabolites that constitute a rich source of bioactive high-value compounds. A major obstacle for exploitation of plant metabolites is that they often are produced in small amounts and in plants difficult to cultivate. This may result in insufficient and unreliable supply leading to fluctuating and high sales prices. Hence  substantial efforts and resources have been invested in developing sustainable and reliable supply routes based on microbial cell factories. Here  we report microbial synthesis of (13R)-manoyl oxide  a proposed intermediate in the biosynthesis of forskolin and other medically important labdane-type terpenoids. Process optimization enabled synthesis of enantiomerically pure (13R)-manoyl oxide as the sole metabolite  providing a pure compound in just two steps with a yield of 10 mg/liter. The work presented here demonstrates the value of a standardized bioengineering pipeline and the large potential of microbial cell factories as sources for sustainable synthesis of complex biochemicals.
Synthetic Biology,,,Assembly of highly standardized gene fragments for high-level production of porphyrins in E. coli. Standardization of molecular cloning greatly facilitates advanced DNA engineering  parts sharing  and collaborative efforts such as the iGEM competition. All of these attributes facilitate exploitation of the wealth of genetic information made available by genome and RNA sequencing. Standardization also comes at the cost of reduced flexibility. We addressed this paradox by formulating a set of design principles aimed at maximizing standardization while maintaining high flexibility in choice of cloning technique and minimizing the impact of standard sequences. The design principles were applied to formulate a molecular cloning pipeline and iteratively assemble and optimize a six-gene pathway for protoporphyrin IX synthesis in Escherichia coli. State of the art production levels were achieved through two simple cycles of engineering and screening. The principles defined here are generally applicable and simplifies the experimental design of projects aimed at biosynthetic pathway construction or engineering.
Qualitative Research,,,Content validity and reliability of the Copenhagen social relations questionnaire. The aim of the present article is to describe the face and content validity as well as reliability of the Copenhagen Social Relations Questionnaire (CSRQ). The face and content validity test was based on focus group discussions and individual interviews with 31 informants. Another 94 men and women participated in an 8-day test-retest analysis. Informants generally expressed that the questions and response categories were relevant and easy to understand. Themes on structure of social relations  social support  and negative aspects of social relations emerged clearly from the interviews. Two additional themes not covered by CSRQ on dynamics and reciprocity of social relations were identified. CSRQ holds satisfactory face and content validity as well as reliability  and is suitable for measuring structure and function of social relations including the negative aspects among middle-aged individuals.
Orthopedics,,,Trajectory of self-reported pain and function and knee extensor muscle strength in young patients undergoing arthroscopic surgery for meniscal tears: A systematic review and meta-analysis. To investigate the trajectory of patient reported pain and function and knee extensor muscle strength over time in young individuals undergoing arthroscopic meniscal surgery. Systematic review and meta-analysis METHODS: Six databases were searched up to October 13th  2016. People aged 30 years or younger undergoing surgery for a meniscal tear. and comparator: (1) Self-reported pain and function in patients undergoing meniscal surgery compared to a non-operative control group (2). Knee extensor strength in the leg undergoing surgery compared to a healthy control group or the contra-lateral leg. Methodological quality was assessed using the SIGN 50 guidelines. No studies were found on patient reported pain and function. Six studies  including 137 patients were included in the analysis on knee extensor muscle strength. Knee extensor muscle strength was impaired in the injured leg prior to surgery and was still reduced compared with control data up to 12 months after surgery (SMD: -1.16) (95% CI: -1.83; -0.49). All included studies were assessed to have a high risk of bias. No studies were found comparing the trajectory of self-reported pain and function in patients undergoing arthroscopic surgery compared with non-operative treatments for young patients with meniscal tears. Knee extensor strength seemed to be impaired up to 12 months after surgery in young patients undergoing surgery for meniscal tears. The results of the present study should be interpreted with caution due to a limited number of available studies with high risk of bias including relatively few patients.
Universities,,,Fertility awareness and attitudes towards parenthood among Danish university college students. Postponing parenthood has steadily increased during the past decades in Western countries. This trend has affected the size of families in the direction of fewer children born per couple. In addition  higher maternal age is associated with an increased risk of pregnancy-related complications such as prematurity and foetal death  while higher paternal age increases the risk of miscarriage and affects time-to-pregnancy. Hence  understanding the circumstances and reflections that influence the decision is greatly needed and little is known about potential gender difference influencing the choice. The aim was to investigate attitudes towards parenthood  intentions for childbirth and knowledge about fertility issues among men and women. We conducted a cross-sectional study based on a validated 49-item questionnaire among students  who attended selected mandatory lectures at a Danish university college in February to April 2016. The participation rate was 99%  and 517 completed the questionnaire. Though the majority of all participants wished to have children in the future (>86%)  there was significant difference between the genders (p = 0.002). Women rated having children to be more important than men did (p < 0.001)  while men rated higher the likelihood of abstaining from having children if faced with infertility (p = 0.003). Knowledge about fertility issues was similar between genders including poor knowledge about the age-related decline in female fertility. While women found it more important to have children before being 'too old' (p = 0.04)  still more than 40% of all respondents intended to have their last child after the age of 35 years. For both genders the most important prerequisite for parenthood was having a partner to share responsibility with. Perceived or experienced life changes related to parenthood were generally positive such as personal development. The majority of respondents wished to have children  but many desired to have these after the biological decline in female fertility. The moderate knowledge level among both genders uncovered in this study is of concern. Future research should address the potential link between fertility knowledge and planning of parenthood. We may benefit from intervention studies examining the effect of routine preconception care.
Nonlinear Dynamics,,,Non-linear Optical Responses of Low-Density Lipoprotein are Associated with Intima-Media Thickness of Carotid Artery in Athletes. We investigated the association between the degree of oxidative modification of LDL particles by non-linear optical response of LDL (Z-scan technique) and the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis in different segments of the carotid artery. We recruited high-intensity athlete runners (n = 44) and controls (n = 51) to participate in the study. The carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT)  interleukin 10 (IL-10)  TNF-alpha  and the non-linear optical responses of LDL particle (Z-scan) were assessed. In athletes  the mean cIMT differed between genders  with higher values observed in female athletes compared to male athletes (P < 0.05). Higher mean values for cIMT were seen in the right carotid arteries of female athletes as compared to female controls (P < 0.05). Higher levels of TNF-alpha and IL-10 were found in athletes (P < 0.05). Yet  ΔΓpv (transmittance curve) of Z-scan in athletes was higher than in the non-athletes  indicating less oxidation in LDL particles of athletes (P < 0.05). There was an inverse association between the ΔΓpv and cIMT in the right internal carotid segments (β = -0.163  P < 0.05) in all subjects  and between the VO2max and the mean cIMT (β = -0.003  P < 0.05) in male subjects. The present study shows that the Z-scan technique enabled to detect less oxidative modifications in LDL particles from athletes. This effect was associated with cIMT in a gender-dependent mode.
Geography,,,Deoxynivalenol and other selected Fusarium toxins in Swedish oats--occurrence and correlation to specific Fusarium species. Fusarium moulds frequently contaminate oats and other cereals world-wide  including those grown in Northern Europe. To investigate the presence of toxigenic Fusarium species and their toxins in oats  samples were taken during 2010 and 2011 in three geographical regions of Sweden (east  west  south). The samples were analysed by real-time PCR for the specific infection level of seven Fusarium species associated with oats and other cereals (Fusarium poae  Fusarium graminearum  Fusarium langsethiae  Fusarium culmorum  Fusarium tricinctum  Fusarium sporotrichioides and Fusarium avenaceum) and with a multi-mycotoxin method based on liquid chromatography/electrospray ionisation-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-MS/MS) for the detection of many fungal metabolites  including deoxynivalenol (DON)  zearalenone (ZEA)  nivalenol (NIV)  T-2 toxin  HT-2 toxins  moniliformin (MON)  beauvericin (BEA) and enniatins (ENNs). Most samples contained at least four of the seven Fusarium species analysed and F. poae  F. langsethiae and F. avenaceum were present in approximately 90-100% of all samples. The most common toxins detected were DON  NIV  BEA and ENNs  which were present in more than 90% of samples. Most Fusarium species and their toxins occurred in higher concentrations in 2010 than in 2011  with the exception of DON and its main producer F. graminearum. Significant regional differences were detected for some moulds and mycotoxins  with higher levels of F. graminearum  DON and ZEA in western Sweden than in the east (P<0.05) and higher levels of F. tricinctum and MON in the south (P<0.05). Correlation analysis showed significant correlations between many Fusarium species and toxin levels. For example  F. tricinctum was significantly correlated to F. avenaceum (r = 0.72  P<0.001)  DON to ZEA (r = 0.52  P<0.001)  DON to F. graminearum (r = 0.77  P<0.001) and the sum of T-2 and HT-2 to F. langsethiae (r = 0.77  P<0.001). The multi-toxin approach employed allowed simultaneous detection of many Fusarium mycotoxins in each sample. In combination with real-time PCR analysis of seven toxigenic Fusarium spp.  the results gave an overall picture of the presence of Fusarium and their toxins in Swedish oats and revealed significant annual and regional differences. This is the first study of the so-called emerging mycotoxins (e.g.  ENNs  MON and BEA) in oats grown in Sweden.
Nonlinear Dynamics,,,Measurement of the nonlinear optical response of low-density lipoprotein solutions from patients with periodontitis before and after periodontal treatment: evaluation of cardiovascular risk markers. The Z-Scan (ZS) technique in the thermal regime has been used to measure the nonlinear optical response of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). The ZS technique is carried out in LDL from 40 patients with chronic periodontitis before and after three  six  and 12 months of periodontal treatment. Clinical parameters such as probing depths  bleeding on probing  total and differential white blood cells counts  lipid profiles  cytokine levels  and antibodies against oxidized LDL are also determined and compared over time. Before the treatment  the ZS experimental results reveal that the LDL particles of these patients are heavily modified. Only after 12 months of the periodontal treatment  the ZS results obtained reveal behavioral characteristics of healthy particles. This conclusion is also supported by complementary laboratorial analysis showing that the periodontal treatment induces systemic changes in several inflammatory markers.
Curriculum,Education  Medical  Undergraduate,,[Peer tutorial programme as a part of the medical curriculum]. This article shows the possible effects of an integrated intensive introduction to medical school using older students as tutors for first-year students. Our project resulted in a significant decrease in the average time to completion of the first five semesters of the medical bachelor' degree.
Research Design,,,Safe excipient exposure in neonates and small children - protocol for the SEEN project. The pharmacokinetics of excipients in neonates differs from that of older children. In a recent pan--European survey  two thirds of neonates received at least one potentially harmful excipient  such as ethanol and benzoates. The content of sweeteners varied by route of administration (more common by enteral than parenteral route)  and regional differences were revealed. The survey did not identify if the content of excipients was more pronounced in medications prescribed for specific medical diseases  e.g. more common in cardiovascular conditions than lung diseases. Furthermore  the quantitative amount of e.g. ethanol in the multi-medicated neonate has not been investigated. The aim of the present study was to quantify the total amount of excipients administered to poly-medicated neonatal and paediatric patients during hospitalisation; and to investigate if any particular medical diseases are treated with potentially harmful excipients. This is a retrospective cohort study based on chart-audit on multi-medicated patients ≤ 5 years of age treated at the Rigshospitalet  Denmark. Preparations with ethanol  propylene glycol  benzyl alcohol  parabens  acesulfame p  aspartame  glycerol  sorbitol and polysorbate-80 will be recorded and cumulative amounts will be calculated. By quantifying the amount of harmful excipients to which paediatric patients are exposed  the study will contribute to a risk/benefit assessment of the medication standards of neonatal and paediatric patients. The Danish Council for Independent Research  grant-id: DFF - 6110-00266. This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (reg. no. NCT02545712).
Electrochemistry,,,Investigation of the interaction between modified ISCOMs and stratum corneum lipid model systems. The modified ISCOMs  so-called Posintro nanoparticles  provide an opportunity for altering the surface charge of the particles  which influences their affinity for the negatively charged antigen sites  cell membranes and lipids in the skin. Hypothetically  this increases the passage of the ISCOMs (or their components) and their load through the stratum corneum. The subsequent increase in the uptake by the antigen-presenting cells results in enhanced transcutaneous immunization. To understand the nature of penetration of Posintro nanoparticles into the intercorneocyte space of the stratum corneum  the interaction between the nanoparticles and lipid model systems in form of liposomes and/or supported lipid bilayer was studied. As a lipid model we used Stratum Corneum Lipid (SCL)  a mixture similar in composition to the lipids of the intercorneocyte space. By Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)  Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)  Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and cryo-Transmission Electron Microscopy (cryo-TEM) it was shown that application of nanoparticles to the SCL bilayers results in lipid disturbance. Investigation of this interaction by means of Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) confirmed existence of an enthalpically unfavorable reaction. All these methods demonstrated that the strength of electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged SCL and the nanoparticles affected their interaction  as decreasing the negative charge of the Posintro nanoparticles leads to enhanced disruption of lipid organization.
Chemistry  Pharmaceutical,,,In vitro cutaneous application of ISCOMs on human skin enhances delivery of hydrophobic model compounds through the stratum corneum. This study aimed to investigate the effect of a novel kind of immune-stimulating complexes (ISCOMs) on human skin penetration of model compounds in vitro to evaluate their potential as a delivery system  ultimately for transcutaneous vaccination. Special focus was on elucidating the mechanisms of penetration. Preparation of ISCOMs was done by dialysis and subsequent purification in a sucrose density gradient. The penetration pathways of acridine-labeled ISCOMs were visualized using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to evaluate the ultrastructural changes in the skin after application of the ISCOMs with or without hydration. Transcutaneous permeation of the model compound  methyl nicotinate  was evaluated in diffusion cells. The prepared ISCOMs were 42-52 nm in diameter as evaluated by dynamic light scattering with zeta potentials of -33 to -26.1 mV. TEM investigations verified the presence of ISCOM structures. Penetration of acridine into skin was greatly increased by incorporation into ISCOMs as visualized by CLSM. Permeation of methyl nicotinate was enhanced in the presence of ISCOMs. Ultrastructural changes of the intercellular space in the stratum corneum after exposure of ISCOMs were observed on micrographs  especially for hydrated skin. In conclusion  cutaneous application of ISCOMs leads to increased penetration of hydrophobic model compounds through human stratum corneum and thus shows potential as a transcutaneous delivery system. The increased penetration seems to be reflected by a change in the intercellular space between the corneocytes  and the effect is most likely caused by the components of the ISCOMs rather than intact ISCOMs.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Comparison of immunocytochemistry  real-time quantitative RT-PCR and flow cytometry for detection of minimal residual disease in neuroblastoma. A quantitative and precise measure of treatment response is warranted in neuroblastoma patients. We compared three quantitative methods often used for detection of minimal residual disease in such patients. Specificity  sensitivity and concordance of immunocytochemistry  real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and flow cytometry were compared using experimental cell suspensions (n = 8) and clinical samples (n = 126). Neuroblastoma cells were identified by immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry using anti-GD2 (14.G2a) and anti-NCAM (5.1H11) antibodies  whereas tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA was the molecular target for quantitative RT-PCR. The sensitivity using flow cytometry was 1-2 logs less than using immunocytochemistry or quantitative RT-PCR. All control samples (n = 35) tested negative by immunocytochemistry  whereas 2/34 (6%) and 1/14 (7%) were false positive by quantitative RT-PCR and flow cytometry respectively. Concordant results were obtained in 85% of patient samples (n = 116) analyzed in parallel by quantitative RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry  whereas 71% of samples analyzed by flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry were concordant (n = 35). The correlation between tumor cell levels analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry was high (r = 0.78  p < 0.001). Quantitative RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry both reliably detected very low levels of neuroblastoma cells in clinical samples. The agreement and correlation between these methods were high. In comparison  flow cytometry was less sensitive.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Immunoexpression of alpha-SMA and CD68 in native kidney biopsies. The role for inflammation and fibrosis as predictive histopathological markers for renal function has been discussed in several studies. Aim of our investigation was to evaluate the clinico-pathological correlation of myofibroblasts expression as markers for initial development of fibrotic processes and macrophagic infiltration in a population with impaired renal function  in order to better understand their value in diagnostic biopsies. We evaluated 20 consecutive native kidney biopsies performed for diagnostic purposes. Material remaining after routine light microscopy and immunofluorescence  was stained for α-SMA as myofibroblast marker and CD68 as macrophage infiltration marker. Quantitative evaluation was conducted by electronic image analysis on consecutive low power fields  avoiding glomeruli  and estimated as percentage of the total area or as number of positive cells/field for macrophage infiltration. The renal biopsies were also evaluated for histological characteristics such as percentual area of inflammation infiltration and fibrosis. Clinical and laboratory data were recorded at biopsy moment and followed-up on a period of 17 ± 11 months after the renal biopsy. Interstitial α-SMA immunoexpression proved to be related with interstitial fibrosis (r=-0.47  p<0.001) and macrophage infiltration (r=0.21  p=0.03). Higher immunoexpression of α-SMA was related with renal function assessed by creatinine level at biopsy moment (r=0.32  p=0.002). In this study  detection of myofibroblast infiltration using α-smooth-muscle actin (α-SMA) proved to be a good marker in describing the initial phases of interstitial fibrosis development in early stages of chronic kidney dysfunction.
Ultrasonics,,,Super-EBA and IRM as root-end fillings in periapical surgery with ultrasonic preparation: a prospective randomized clinical study of 206 consecutive teeth. This study evaluated the treatment outcome after periapical surgery with the use of 2 different retrograde root-filling materials and the influence of 3 pre- and perioperative variables on the periapical healing. Two hundred six teeth in 164 patients were randomly allocated to receive either IRM or Super-EBA as a retrograde root-end seal. The teeth were reviewed 12 months after surgery. The influence of lesion size  lesion type  and orthograde root filling quality on healing was analyzed. One hundred ninety-four teeth in 153 patients were reviewed. Radiologic evaluation and clinical examination revealed 91% success rate for the IRM group and 82% for the Super-EBA group. There was no statistical significance in the healing outcome between the 2 groups (Fisher exact test). The analyzed pre- and perioperative variables had no significant influence on the treatment outcome (Z test). Both retrograde materials tested in this study can serve as a root-end seal in periapical infected teeth  according to the results of the healing outcome after 12 months' follow-up.
Education  Medical  Undergraduate,Educational Measurement,General Surgery,Mobile spaced education for surgery rotation improves National Board of Medical Examiners scores. Use of mobile devices for medical education is increasing. The aim of this study was to describe the implementation of a spaced education-based app study program in a third year medical school surgery rotation and examine its effects on National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) examination performance. Case-based questions were created and distributed to students on a voluntary basis via a mobile app. Questions were repeated in a spaced based manner until mastered. Students completed surveys regarding study habits and app use. NBME examination scores and prior academic measures were obtained. Users of the app were compared to non-users of the app and the previous years' class. One hundred fifty-two students were offered the app; 121 (80%) used it. App users had a final NBME score of 77.5% compared with 68.8% (P < 0.01) in non-users  although their prior academic achievement was better. Categorizing them by their academic achievement and intensity of app use demonstrated significantly higher scores in regular users of the app as compared with casual and non-users in mid (78 versus 75 versus 71.2%  P < 0.01) and low-achieving students (71.4 versus 70 versus 64.6  P < 0.01)  but not high-achieving students (85.3 versus 81.1 versus 79.7  P = 0.09). Stepwise linear regression modeling revealed intensity of app use accounted for 6% of the variance in NBME scores. Use of the app-based program was an effective tool associated with higher scores on standardized tests in lower level achieving students.
Rheology,,,Intraabdominal microdialysis - methodological challenges. Microdialysis is used for in vivo sampling of extracellular molecules. The technique provides a continuous and dynamic view of concentrations of both endogenous released and exogenous administered substances. Microdialysis carries a low risk of complications and has proven to be a safe procedure in humans. The technique has been applied in several clinical areas  including gastrointestinal surgery. Microdialysis may be used for studies of tissue metabolism  and the technique is also a promising tool for pharmacological studies of drug penetration into abdominal organ tissue and the peritoneal cavity. The clinical significance of intraabdominal microdialysis in postoperative monitoring of surgical patients has yet to be proven. In this review  we introduce the microdialysis technique  and we present an overview of theoretical and practical considerations that should be taken into account when using microdialysis in intraabdominal clinical research.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Treatment of non-IBD anal fistula. The course of the fistula tract in relation to the anal sphincter is identified by clinical examination under general anaesthesia using a fistula probe and injection of fluid into the external fistula opening. In the event of a complex fistula or in the case of fistula recurrence  this should be supplemented with an endoluminal ultrasound scan and/or an MRI scan. St. Mark's fistula chart should be used for the description. Simple fistulas are amenable to fistulotomy  whereas treatment of complex fistulas requires special expertise and management of all available treatment modalities to tailor the right operation to the individual patient. The given levels of evidence and grades of recommendations are according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine (www.cemb.net).

Anesthesiology,,,Injection pressures by anesthesiologists during simulated peripheral nerve block. Anesthesiologists typically rely on a subjective evaluation ("syringe feel") of possible abnormal resistance to injection while performing a peripheral nerve block (PNB). A greater force required to perform the injection is believed to be associated with intraneural injection. The hypothesis of this study is that anesthesiologists vary in their perception of "normal" injection force  that the syringe feel method is inconsistent in estimating resistance  and that needle design may affect the injection force. Thirty anesthesiologists were asked to inject a local anesthetic  as they would in their everyday practice  through a commonly used syringe and needle assembly. Injection force was measured using an in-line manometer coupled to a computer via an analog-to-digital conversion board. In addition  injection force at clinically relevant injection speeds was determined using 3 differently sized needles from 4 different manufacturers. During a steady injection rate  all anesthesiologists perceived an increase in the force required to inject  even with minor pressures changes (0.6 +/- 0.3 psi). However  the 30 anesthesiologists  21 (70%) initiated injection using a force that resulted in pressures greater than 20 psi; 15 (50%) used a force greater than 25 psi  and 3 (10%) exerted pressures greater than 30 psi. Pressures varied as much as 20-fold among needles of the same gauge/length from different manufacturers (P <.01). Anesthesiologists vary widely in their perception of appropriate force and rate of injection during PNB. The syringe-feel method of assessing injection force is inconsistent and may be further affected by variability in needle design.
Pediatric Nursing,,,Effects of computer reminders on complications of peripheral venous catheters and nurses' adherence to a guideline in paediatric care--a cluster randomised study. Reminder systems in electronic patient records (EPR) have proven to affect both health care professionals' behaviour and patient outcomes. The aim of this cluster randomised trial was to investigate the effects of implementing a clinical practice guideline (CPG) for peripheral venous catheters (PVCs) in paediatric care in the format of reminders integrated in the EPRs  on PVC-related complications  and on registered nurses' (RNs') self-reported adherence to the guideline. An additional aim was to study the relationship between contextual factors and the outcomes of the intervention. The study involved 12 inpatient units at a paediatric university hospital. The reminders included choice of PVC  hygiene  maintenance  and daily inspection of PVC site. Primary outcome was documented signs and symptoms of PVC-related complications at removal  retrieved from the EPR. Secondary outcome was RNs' adherence to a PVC guideline  collected through a questionnaire that also included RNs' perceived work context  as measured by the Alberta Context Tool. Units were allocated into two strata  based on occurrence of PVCs. A blinded simple draw of lots from each stratum randomised six units to the control and intervention groups  respectively. Units were not blinded. The intervention group included 626 PVCs at baseline and 618 post-intervention and the control group 724 PVCs at baseline and 674 post-intervention. RNs included at baseline were 212 (65.4 %) and 208 (71.5 %) post-intervention. No significant effect was found for the computer reminders on PVC-related complications nor on RNs' adherence to the guideline recommendations. The complication rate at baseline and post-intervention was 40.6 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 36.7-44.5) and 41.9 % (95 % CI 38.0-45.8)  for the intervention group and 40.3 % (95 % CI 36.8-44.0) and 46.9 % (95 % CI 43.1-50.7) for the control. In general  RNs' self-rated work context varied from moderately low to moderately high  indicating that conditions for a successful implementation to occur were less optimal. The reminders might have benefitted from being accompanied by a tailored intervention that targeted specific barriers  such as the low frequency of recorded reasons for removal  the low adherence to daily inspection of PVC sites  and the lack of regular feedback to the RNs.

Evidence-Based Practice,Qualitative Research,,What Registered Nurses Do and Do Not in the Management of Pediatric Peripheral Venous Catheters and Guidelines: Unpacking the Outcomes of Computer Reminders. Clinical practical guidelines (CPGs) may enhance evidence-based practice  but require implementation. Computer reminders have previously shown various effects in supporting implementation; in a concomitant study  we found no effect on complications in peripheral venous catheters (PVCs) or registered nurses' (RNs) adherence to a CPG in pediatric care. Yet  there is a need to determine how reminders operate in particular contexts. To depict if  in what context  and how computer reminders regarding evidence-based management of PVC in pediatric care are applied according to RNs' actions and experience. Qualitative data from nonparticipant observations and interviews with 18 RNs in four intervention units at a pediatric hospital were analyzed with content analysis. Attention given to the computer reminders varied; the RNs noticed them in units where there was an agreement about the management and recording of PVCs  but not elsewhere. Rather  computer reminders did not facilitate adherence to the PVC-CPG where the CPG was not acknowledged from the start. RNs who knew how to manage PVCs had peer support and received additional reminders  which suggested that the computer reminders added to the significance of PVCs in pediatric care. While the computer reminders alone did not support CPG implementation  they further increased the attention to PVCs in contexts where there was a readiness to change along with a supportive culture. We suggest further studies tailoring implementation strategies to include electronic means if there is a beneficial context.
Research Design,,,The formation and design of the TRIAGE study--baseline data on 6005 consecutive patients admitted to hospital from the emergency department. Patient crowding in emergency departments (ED) is a common challenge and associated with worsened outcome for the patients. Previous studies on biomarkers in the ED setting has focused on identification of high risk patients  and and the ability to use biomarkers to identify low-risk patients has only been sparsely examined. The broader aims of the TRIAGE study are to develop methods to identify low-risk patients appropriate for early ED discharge by combining information from a wide range of new inflammatory biomarkers and vital signs  the present baseline article aims to describe the formation of the TRIAGE database and characteristize the included patients. We included consecutive patients ≥ 17 years admitted to hospital after triage staging in the ED. Blood samples for a biobank were collected and plasma stored in a freezer (-80 °C). Triage was done by a trained nurse using the Danish Emergency Proces Triage (DEPT) which categorizes patients as green (not urgent)  yellow (urgent)  orange (emergent) or red (rescusitation). Presenting complaints  admission diagnoses  comorbidities  length of stay  and 'events' during admission (any of 20 predefined definitive treatments that necessitates in-hospital care)  vital signs and routine laboratory tests taken in the ED were aslo included in the database. Between September 5(th) 2013 and December 6(th) 2013  6005 patients were included in the database and the biobank (94.1 % of all admissions). Of these  1978 (32.9 %) were categorized as green  2386 (39.7 %) yellow  1616 (26.9 %) orange and 25 (0.4 %) red. Median age was 62 years (IQR 46-76)  49.8 % were male and median length of stay was 1 day (IQR 0-4). No events were found in 2658 (44.2 %) and 158 (2.6 %) were admitted to intensive or intermediate-intensive care unit and 219 (3.6 %) died within 30 days. A higher triage acuity level was associated with numerous events  including acute surgery  endovascular intervention  i.v. treatment  cardiac arrest  stroke  admission to intensive care  hospital transfer  and mortality within 30 days (p < 0.001). The TRIAGE database has been completed and includes data and blood samples from 6005 unselected consecutive hospitalized patients. More than 40 % experienced no events and were therefore potentially unnecessary hospital admissions.
Pediatric Nursing,,,Relationship between work context and adherence to a clinical practice guideline for peripheral venous catheters among registered nurses in pediatric care. It is known that registered nurses' (RNs') work context is related to their use of research and that it can affect nurse and patient satisfaction  as well as the outcomes of care. However  little is known about the relationship between work context and nurses' adherence to clinical practice guidelines. The aim of this study was to describe RNs' adherence to a clinical practice guideline (CPG) on the management of peripheral venous catheters (PVCs)  their perceptions of work context  and how nurses' work context and characteristics relate to guideline adherence. This cross-sectional survey was conducted at a large pediatric university hospital in Sweden. Data were collected through a questionnaire on RNs' adherence to components of a CPG and by using the Alberta Context Tool to assess the nurses' perceptions of work context  including leadership  culture  feedback processes  and other organizational characteristics. Work context--in the form of structural and electronic resources  information sharing activities  and feedback processes--was in different ways associated with the adherence to the CPG components. The RNs' adherence on unit level varied: half the units demonstrated complete adherence on disinfection of hands  whereas a majority of the units reported less than 70% adherence on the use of disposable gloves and the daily inspection of a PVC site. Our findings indicate that components in one CPG might require diverse implementation strategies because they are linked to different contextual factors.
Epidemiology,,,Epidemiology of intra- and peri-articular structural injuries in traumatic knee joint hemarthrosis - data from 1145 consecutive knees with subacute MRI. In patients with traumatic knee distorsion and hemarthrosis  to investigate the panorama of structural injury  as visualized on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Cohort study of 1145 consecutive patients with traumatic knee distorsion who underwent MRI within median 8 days after injury. We present structural injury as visualized on MRI in relation to age  sex and activity at injury. Population based gender specific annual incidences of common structural injuries were calculated. The majority of injuries (72%) occurred during sports. Overall  anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture was the most common structural injury (52%)  followed by meniscal tear (41%) and lateral patella dislocation (LPD  17%). Only 12% of ACL tears were isolated with meniscal tear being the most common associated injury (55%). The annual incidence of ACL injury was 77 (70-85  95% CI) per 100 000 inhabitants with significant differences between men (91  80-103) and women (63  53-73). In those aged 16 years and younger  LPD was the most frequent structural injury  both in boys (39%) and girls (43%). In this age group  the annual incidence of LPD was 88 (68-113) and higher in boys (113  81-154) than in girls (62  39-95). ACL injury occurs in one out of two knees with traumatic hemarthrosis but only 12% are without concomitant structural injury. The overall rate of traumatic knee hemarthrosis and ACL injury is higher in men. In those aged 10-19 years  ACL rupture is more common among girls than boys whereas in those 16 years and younger  LPD is more common among boys than girls.
Drug Design,Research Design,,Medication Nonadherence  "Professional Subjects " and Apparent Placebo Responders: Overlapping Challenges for Medications Development. Nonadherence is a major problem in clinical trials of new medications. To evaluate the extent of nonadherence  this study evaluated pharmacokinetic sampling from 1765 subjects receiving active therapy across 8 psychiatric trials conducted between 2001 and 2011. With nonadherence defined as greater than 50% of plasma samples below the limit of quantification for study drug  the percentage of nonadherent subjects ranged from 12.8% to 39.2%. There was a trend toward increased nonadherence in studies with greater numbers of subjects  but an association with nonadherence was not apparent for other study design parameters or subject characteristics. For 2 trials with multiple recruitment sites in geographical proximity  several subjects attempted to simultaneously enroll at separate site locations. The construct of "professional subjects " those who enroll in trials only for financial gain  is gaining attention  and we therefore modeled the impact of professional subjects on medication efficacy trials. The results indicate that enrollment of professional subjects who are destined to succeed (those who will appear to achieve treatment success regardless of study drug assignment) can substantially increase both the apparent placebo response rate and the sample size requirement for statistical power  while decreasing the observed effect size. The overlapping nature of nonadherence  professional subjects  and placebo response suggests that these issues should be considered and addressed together. Following this approach  we describe a novel clinical trial design to minimize the adverse effects of professional subjects on trial outcomes and discuss methods to monitor adherence.
Statistics as Topic,,,Relationship of suicide rates to economic variables in Europe: 2000-2011. It is unclear whether there is a direct link between economic crises and changes in suicide rates. The Lopez-Ibor Foundation launched an initiative to study the possible impact of the economic crisis on European suicide rates. Data was gathered and analysed from 29 European countries and included the number of deaths by suicide in men and women  the unemployment rate  the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita  the annual economic growth rate and inflation. There was a strong correlation between suicide rates and all economic indices except GPD per capita in men but only a correlation with unemployment in women. However  the increase in suicide rates occurred several months before the economic crisis emerged. Overall  this study confirms a general relationship between the economic environment and suicide rates; however  it does not support there being a clear causal relationship between the current economic crisis and an increase in the suicide rate.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Microvessel density and endothelial cell proliferation levels in colorectal liver metastases from patients given neo-adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy and bevacizumab. The treatment of patients with colorectal liver metastasis has improved significantly and first line therapy is often combined chemotherapy and bevacizumab  although it is unknown who responds to this regimen. Colorectal liver metastases grow in different histological growth patterns showing differences in angiogenesis. To identify possible response markers  histological markers of angiogenesis were assessed. Patients who underwent resection of colorectal liver metastasis at Rigshospitalet  Copenhagen  Denmark from 2007 to 2011 were included (n = 254) including untreated and patients treated with chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus bevacizumab. The resected liver metastases were characterised with respect to growth pattern  endothelial and tumour cell proliferation as well as microvessel density and tumour regression. Tumour regression grade of liver metastases differed significantly between untreated/chemotherapy treated patients in comparison to chemotherapy plus bevacizumab treated patients (both p < 0.0001). Microvessel density was decreased in liver metastases from patients treated with bevacizumab in comparison to those from untreated/chemotherapy-treated patients (p = 0.006/p = 0.002). Tumour cell proliferation assessed by Ki67 expression correlated to a shorter recurrence free survival in the total patient cohort. In conclusion  liver metastases from patients treated with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and bevacizumab had significantly lower microvessel densities and tumour regression grades when compared to liver metastases from untreated or chemotherapy treated patients. This may indicate that bevacizumab treatment results in altered vascular biology and tumour viability  with possible tumour reducing effect.
Immunohistochemistry,,,TNF Receptor-2 Facilitates an Immunosuppressive Microenvironment in the Liver to Promote the Colonization and Growth of Hepatic Metastases. Successful colonization by a cancer cell of a distant metastatic site requires immune escape in the new microenvironment. TNF signaling has been implicated broadly in the suppression of immune surveillance that prevents colonization at the metastatic site and therefore must be blocked. In this study  we explored how TNF signaling influences the efficiency of liver metastasis by colon and lung carcinoma in mice that are genetically deficient for the TNF receptor TNFR2. We found a marked reduction in liver metastases that correlated with a greatly reduced accumulation at metastatic sites of CD11b(+)GR-1(+) myeloid cells with enhanced arginase activity  identified as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC). Reduced infiltration of MDSC coincided with a reduction in the number of CD4(+)FoxP3(+) T regulatory cells in the tumors. Reconstitution of TNFR2-deficient mice with normal bone marrow  or adoptive transfer of TNFR2-expressing MDSC into these mice  was sufficient to restore liver metastasis to levels in wild-type mice. Conversely  treatment with TNFR2 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides reduced liver metastasis in wild-type mice. Clinically  immunohistochemical analysis of liver metastases from chemotherapy-naïve colon cancer patients confirmed the presence of CD33(+)HLA-DR(-)TNFR2(+) myeloid cells in the periphery of hepatic metastases. Overall  our findings implicate TNFR2 in supporting MDSC-mediated immune suppression and metastasis in the liver  suggesting the use of TNFR2 inhibitors as a strategy to prevent metastatic progression to liver in colon  lung  and various other types of cancer.
Allergy and Immunology,,,Exposure chamber for allergen challenge. The development and validation of a new concept. Exposure chambers have proven to be valuable tools in studying allergic diseases. The chamber provides a controlled environment and maintains conditions for measuring the amount of allergen inducing symptoms in allergic subjects. The aim of the present study was to develop and test an exposure chamber. The chamber was constructed as an airtight tent  made of transparent polyethylene  easy to adapt to the shape of an existing room  easy to clean  and providing exact allergen-dosage control. Airflow to the interior of the tent was controlled by a variable inlet ventilator fitted with a micropore filter and balanced by a variable high-volume air-sampler on the outlet side. Trace material and allergen were administered as aerosols with a nebulizer connected to the inlet pipe. Samples were obtained from interior surfaces and filters at the outlet. Two different methods were used to test the concept. One method used a colored  neutral trace substance (phenol red indicator) measured photometrically on extracts from filters. Secondly  house-dust mite allergen (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus) was applied  with samples analyzed by an ELISA technique. The results demonstrated the ability of the system to administer and sample allergen with a high degree of reproducibility. A clinical pilot trial proved the capability of the system to initiate symptoms in allergic subjects.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Muscle biopsies in children--an evaluation of histopathology and clinical value during a 5-year period. Muscle biopsy is an important diagnostic tool in the investigation of children with neuromuscular disorders. This report presents the experience with paediatric muscle biopsies during a 5-year period at a routine pathology laboratory. A total number of 58 cases were included  and indications  microscopical findings  and final histopathological diagnoses were recorded. A total of 21 biopsies were from females (36%) and 37 biopsies from males (64%); 53% of the cases were from children under 2 years of age. Major pathological findings were found in 30% comprising muscular dystrophy  neurogenic atrophy  and congenital and metabolic disorders  even in cases with vague clinical manifestations. These findings confirm the high diagnostic yield of muscle biopsies  especially as new techniques have been introduced such as immunohistochemistry. Muscle pathology is difficult and emphasizes the importance of this service being undertaken by specialized laboratories with an experienced staff. Microscopical examination of muscle biopsies should be based on adequate clinical information  demonstrating the necessity of close contact between pathologists and referring physicians.
Nonlinear Dynamics,,,Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships of cognitive and psychomotor effects of intravenous buprenorphine infusion in human volunteers. The main objective of the present study was to characterize the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship of the effects of buprenorphine on cognitive functioning in healthy volunteers. Twenty-three male volunteers received 0.6 mg buprenorphine as an intravenous infusion over 150 min. The cognitive and psychomotor performance was evaluated before and at various times after drug administration by a test battery consisting of trail-making test for visual information processing  finger-tapping test for psychomotor speed  and continuous reaction time for attention. Non-linear mixed effect modelling was used in the analysis of the PK/PD relationships. Buprenorphine caused significant deficits in cognitive and psychomotor functioning. The time course of cognitive and psychomotor impairment was found to have a slow distribution to the biophase from plasma with PK/PD models involving an effect compartment providing the best descriptions of the time course of the data. The values for half-life of biophase equilibration were consistent between the neuropsychological tests in the range of 66.6-84.9 min. The time to onset and duration of the cognitive and psychomotor impairment of buprenorphine was determined by a slow distribution to the biophase.
Anesthesiology,Emergency Medicine,Research,Scandinavian research in anaesthesiology 1981-2000: visibility and impact in EU and world context. We wished to assess the development in number and impact of publications in anaesthesiology and intensive care medicine from 1981 to 2000 in the four Scandinavian countries: Sweden  Norway  Finland  and Denmark. For comparison  we also analyzed data from the UK and the Netherlands. Publication and citation data from 1981 to 2000 were gathered from National Science Indicators (2001)  covering 33 journals indexed in Current Contents. Data were analyzed in running 5-year periods. The following informetric indicators were used: absolute number of publications; absolute number of citations; absolute citation impact (average number of citations per publication per 5-year period); citation impact relative to the European Union and the world; and the percentage of cited papers from each country. The annual number of publications from Denmark was stable over the 20-year period. Sweden increased its production by 35%  while the remaining four countries showed increases from 100% to 146%. Thus  Sweden and Denmark lost visibility within the European Union (EU) and in world context. The EU and world citation shares of Finland and Norway increased slightly  whereas those of Sweden  Denmark  the UK  and the Netherlands all declined significantly. The absolute citation impact (ACI) increased for all the four Scandinavian countries. The ACI of the Netherlands did not change and was surpassed by all the Scandinavian countries by 1994-98  while the UK finished below the other five countries. (1) The annual number of publications from Sweden  Norway  Finland  the UK  and the Netherlands increased after the late eighties  whereas the net publication output from Denmark was stagnant over the 20-year period investigated; (2) the international publication and citation visibility of Finland and Norway increased slightly  as opposed to the significant decrease seen by the other four countries; (3) judging from the increase in absolute and relative citation impact and in the percentage of cited papers  the recognition of publications from the four Scandinavian countries increased over the past 20 years.
Cardiology,Electrophysiology,Radiology,Radiation dose among different cardiac and vascular invasive procedures: The RODEO study. Interventional radiology and cardiology procedures contribute significantly to the collective dose of radiation exposure from medical interventions. Recent and dedicated studies comparing directly these procedures in term of patient radiation exposure are lacking. Our aim was to compare radiation exposure among different interventional procedures performed under fluoroscopic guidance. The RODEO study (NCT: 02972736) is an international observational retrospective multicenter study enrolling all patients undergoing diagnostic or interventional procedures performed by different interventional operators (i.e. radiologists  interventional cardiologists or electrophysiologists) in 6 centers  without exclusion criteria. The primary end-point of the study was the comparison of dose area product (DAP) among interventional cardiology  electrophysiology or interventional radiology procedures. A total of 17 711 procedures were included in the study: 13 522 interventional cardiology  2352 electrophysiology and 1864 interventional radiology procedures. The highest DAP values were observed for interventional radiology procedures (74Gy∗cm(2) [Interquartile range 27-178Gy∗cm(2)])  followed by interventional cardiology (40Gy∗cm(2) [22-78Gy∗cm(2)]) and electrophysiology procedures (13Gy∗cm(2) [4-44Gy∗cm(2)]  p<0.0001). In term of specific procedures  the highest DAP values were observed in structural or valvular cardiac procedures (134Gy∗cm(2) [51-260Gy∗cm(2)]) whereas the lowest DAP values in pacemaker insertion (11Gy∗cm(2) [4-28Gy∗cm(2)]). In this large multicenter study  the highest radiation exposure was observed in procedures performed by interventional radiologists. However  among specific procedures  structural or valvular cardiac procedures were associated with the highest radiation exposure.
Pharmacogenetics,,,No association between non-bullous skin reactions from lamotrigine and heterozygosity of UGT1A4 genetic variants *2(P24T) or *3(L48V) in Norwegian patients. High initial serum concentrations increase the risk of cutaneous adverse reactions. Genetic variants of the main metabolizing isoenzyme  uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A4 influence the elimination of lamotrigine (LTG). Our aim was to investigate the potential association between the two best studied variants  *2 (P24T) and *3 (L48V)  and the occurrence non-bullous skin reactions from LTG. The study included 29 patients of Caucasian ethnicity with a history of non-bullous skin reactions from LTG. 184 subjects tolerant to LTG for at least three months were used as controls. UGT1A4 genotyping was performed in all patients and controls by sequencing of the first part of exon 1. Six controls were excluded due to rare genetic variants. Two of 29 subjects (7%) with rash from LTG were heterozygous for UGT1A4 *2  compared to 23 of 178 (13%) tolerant controls (p=0.54). Four of 29 subjects (14%) with rash from LTG were heterozygous for UGT1A4 *3 compared to 25 of 178 (14%) tolerant controls (p=0.97). It is unlikely that heterozygosity of the UGT1A4 genetic variants *2(P24T) or *3(L48V) influences the risk of non-bullous skin reactions in patients treated with LTG.
Outcome Assessment (Health Care),,,The formation and design of the 'Acute Admission Database'- a database including a prospective  observational cohort of 6279 patients triaged in the emergency department in a larger Danish hospital. Management and care of the acutely ill patient has improved over the last years due to introduction of systematic assessment and accelerated treatment protocols. We have  however  sparse knowledge of the association between patient status at admission to hospital and patient outcome. A likely explanation is the difficulty in retrieving all relevant information from one database. The objective of this article was 1) to describe the formation and design of the 'Acute Admission Database'  and 2) to characterize the cohort included. All adult patients triaged at the Emergency Department at Hillerød Hospital and admitted either to the observationary unit or to a general ward in-hospital were prospectively included during a period of 22 weeks. The triage system used was a Danish adaptation of the Swedish triage system  ADAPT. Data from 3 different data sources was merged using a unique identifier  the Central Personal Registry number; 1) Data from patient admission; time and date  vital signs  presenting complaint and triage category  2) Blood sample results taken at admission  including a venous acid-base status  and 3) Outcome measures  e.g. length of stay  admission to Intensive Care Unit  and mortality within 7 and 28 days after admission. In primary triage  patients were categorized as red (4.4%)  orange (25.2%)  yellow (38.7%) and green (31.7%). Abnormal vital signs were present at admission in 25% of the patients  most often temperature (10.5%)  saturation of peripheral oxygen (9.2%)  Glasgow Coma Score (6.6%) and respiratory rate (4.8%). A venous acid-base status was obtained in 43% of all patients. The majority (78%) had a pH within the normal range (7.35-7.45)  15% had acidosis (pH < 7.35) and 7% had alkalosis (pH > 7.45). Median length of stay was 2 days (range 1-123). The proportion of patients admitted to Intensive Care Unit was 1.6% (95% CI 1.2-2.0)  1.8% (95% CI 1.5-2.2) died within 7 days  and 4.2% (95% CI 3.7-4.7) died within 28 days after admission. Despite challenges of data registration  we succeeded in creating a database of adequate size and data quality. Future studies will focus on the association between patient status at admission and patient outcome  e.g. admission to Intensive Care Unit or in-hospital mortality.
Food Microbiology,,,Fatal outbreak of botulism in Greenland. Botulism commonly occurs when the anaerobic  gram-positive bacterium Clostridium botulinum  under suitable conditions  produces botulinum neurotoxins. Named A-F  these toxins are the immediate causative agent of the clinical symptoms of symmetrical  descending neurological deficits  including respiratory muscle paralysis. We present five cases of foodborne botulism occurring in Greenland  two with fatal outcome  caused by ingestion of tradionally preserved eider fowl. In the cases of the survivors  antitoxin and supportive care  including mechanical ventilation  were administered. In these cases recovery was complete. Microbiological assays  including toxin neutralization bioassay  demonstrated the presence of neurotoxin E in two survivors. The third survivor was shown by PCR to have the BoNT type E gene in faeces. This is the first report of cases of fatal botulism in Greenland. It underscores the importance of prompt coordinated case management effort in a geographically isolated area such as Greenland.
Nursing Methodology Research,,,Family perceptions of end-of-life care in an urban ICU. As most Canadians die in hospital  the final contact of family members with their loved ones is frequently in an unknown and uncomfortable environment. Family members are integral to the end-of-life decision-making process and are vital contributors to the comfort of dying patients. A quantitative study was conducted in three critical care areas where the stated goals were to provide not only quality care to patients  but also support to families. The researchers sought to determine levels of satisfaction with care  visitation  support  comfort and pain measures. Three hundred surveys were mailed to next of kin who had a loved one die in the critical care areas of an urban tertiary care centre within the prior three years. Survey questions covered such issues as perceptions regarding the decision to stop life supports  access to the patient  access to physicians and nurses and information regarding the patient's status  support provided by the hospital  and organ donation attitudes. Multiple regression analysis revealed that three factors predicted perceptions of overall quality of care: 1) being informed by nurses and physicians of any changes  2) having the same group of nurses provide care  and 3) having one individual act as the family contact. Together these factors accounted for 52% of the variance in perceptions of care. Two factors accounted for 59% of the variance in dissatisfaction with the information received: 1) the perception that physicians did not spend enough time answering family questions  and 2) that the family was not present when the patient died. Consistency in nursing care and provision of information to family members may be difficult in the fast pace of an ICU  but are reasonable program objectives considering the positive influence this has on perceptions of care. Further  flexible visitation policies which maximize access between family members and both their dying loved one and health care professionals appear to have a beneficial effect on satisfaction.
Nursing Methodology Research,Operating Room Nursing,Qualitative Research,Trauma and tribulation: the experiences and attitudes of operating room nurses working with organ donors. In the past two decades  significant medical advances have resulted in remarkable success and survival rates for organ recipients. However  the rates of donation have not kept pace with the demand  resulting in a critical shortage of available healthy organs. It has been suggested that the attitudes of medical personnel towards organ retrieval is a key success factor in improving organ donation. Yet there is evidence that those closest to the process of procurement are the most negative. This study sought to examine the attitudes towards organ donation of operating room nurses and their experiences of participating in the procurement of organs for transplant  in order to unravel factors that contribute to their attitudes. This study relied upon in-depth qualitative interviews with 14 operating room nurses who participated in organ procurement in a large urban trauma centre. The results of this study suggest that the process of organ procurement is highly stressful and raises many concerns for operating room nurses. Factors  which added to participants' distress  include organizational factors such as strained relationships within surgical teams  concerns about the dignity of the patient and the well-being of the family and exposure to death and trauma. Experiences of nurses participating in surgical removal of organs for transplantation resulted in personal feelings of distress and negative attitudes to the issue of organ donation which may be transmitted to others and undermine organ procurement efforts. The concerns of these vital members of the organ procurement team should be heeded and actions taken to reduce their distress and improve their attitudes towards donation.
Education  Medical  Graduate,Specialization,,[The Danish introductory position provides a qualified choice of specialty]. The Danish introductory position is unique. It is placed between internship and the main part of specialist education. Workplace-based assessment according to central objectives is central. The purpose of the introductory position is twofold: the resident is introduced to the specialty - the specialty choice is thus based on a context-based personal experience  and the specialties can assess the potential and suitability of the resident. Also opportunities for career counselling are strengthened. In this way both choice of specialty and selection into the specialties is qualified.
Curriculum,Education  Medical  Graduate,Models  Educational,Evaluation of a national process of reforming curricula in postgraduate medical education. A national reform of the postgraduate medical education in Denmark introduced (1) Outcome-based education  (2) The CanMEDS framework of competence related to seven roles of the doctor  and (3) In-training assessment. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the process of developing new curricula for 38 specialist training programmes. The research question was: which conditions promote and which conditions impede the process? Evaluation of the process was conducted among 76 contact-persons  who were chairing the curriculum development process within the specialties. Quantitative and qualitative data from a questionnaire survey and telephone interviews were triangulated for data analysis. The response rate of the questionnaire survey was 83% (63/76). Twenty-six telephone interviews were conducted. Identified promoting factors included positive attitude and motivation in faculty and support from written guidelines and seminars. Identified impeding factors included insufficient pedagogical support  poor introduction to the task  changing and inconsistent information from authorities  replacement of advisors  and stressful deadlines. This study identified promoting and impeding factors in a national postgraduate curriculum development process. Surprisingly the study indicates that pedagogical support provided throughout a process in some aspects might not be useful. General suggestions regarding curriculum reform processes are formulated.
Education  Medical,Education  Medical  Graduate,Medicine,[Career counselling and choice of speciality]. Career counselling is meant to support and ensure an early and relevant choice of specialty. Self-awareness regarding personality  life goals  wishes for family life  and lifestyle is of help in narrowing down the number of specialties to those that fit personal attitudes and preferences. The counsellor must be aware that the trainees' subjective opinions about the specialties may not be in line with the actual conditions. Hence  career counselling should provide factual knowledge about the specialties including information on the working conditions and defining characteristics of the specialties.
Pediatrics,,,Consensus on the appropriate use of intrathecal baclofen (ITB) therapy in paediatric spasticity. Among features of motor disorders in children  spasticity is associated with considerable morbidity and problems in care  particularly in severely affected patients. Intrathecal baclofen (ITB) has been increasingly used as a relatively specific treatment modality for spasticity. To date  most of the evidence for its use in paediatric patients has come from retrospective and uncontrolled studies  although randomised  controlled trials of screening ITB and ITB therapy itself have recently been published. This consensus statement on the use of ITB in paediatric patients with spasticity was developed on the basis of currently available evidence  with the aim of providing information for clinicians  promoting an expert opinion and a consistent approach to the management of these patients and emphasising the need for further prospective  large-scale studies.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Antibiotic strategies in the treatment of infection in critically ill patients]. Inappropriate antimicrobial therapy of pneumonia  severe sepsis and bacteraemia is associated with high mortality. Adjustment of insufficient initial antibiotics after susceptibility testing does not reduce mortality. Guidelines on critically ill patients should focus on antibiograms for each intensive care unit to ensure full coverage of initial therapy with a broad-spectrum antibiotic with high tissue penetration  minimal organ toxicity and low risk of resistance development. Early reassessment and withdrawal of antibiotics  if not indicated  are important elements in reducing antibiotic resistance. The initial broad-spectrum should be narrowed according to bacterial susceptibility data. This evidence-based intervention ensures appropriate antimicrobial treatment to critically ill patients to improve outcome and reduction of the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
Education  Medical,,,Are Danish doctors comfortable teaching in English? From 2012-2015  the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology and of Pediatrics at the University of Copenhagen conducted a project  "Internationalization at Home "  offering clinical teaching in English. The project allowed international students to work with Danish speaking students in a clinical setting. Using semi-quantitative questionnaires to 89 clinicians about use of English and need for training  this paper considers if Danish clinical doctors are prepared to teach in English. The majority self-assessed their English proficiency between seven and eight on a 10 unit visual analogue scale  with 10 equivalent to working in Danish  while 15 % rated five or less. However  one-fourth found teaching and writing in English to be twice as difficult than in Danish  and 12 % rated all teaching tasks in English at four or less compared to Danish. The self-assessed need for additional English skills was perceived low. Teaching in English was rated as 30 % more difficult than in Danish  and a significant subgroup of doctors had difficulties in all forms of communication in English  resulting in challenges when introducing international students in non-native English speaking medical departments.
Education  Medical  Undergraduate,Gynecology,Obstetrics,A new model of paired clinical teaching of international and Danish medical students. Since 2006  one hospital has offered two clinical courses in obstetrics/gynaecology and paediatrics to international (I) students. However  as I-student enrolment increased  the hospital faced cut-backs. As from 2010  I-team course evaluations therefore dropped to unacceptable levels and more I- than Danish (DK) students failed exams. Therefore  in 2012 we started a three-year internationalisation project (I-project) at two hospitals. The primary intervention was to pair training for I- and DK-students at clinical contact  and to offer an exclusive daily lecturer for I-teams. We compared the course evaluations and exam grades of I-teams and DK-teams for two years prior to (107 from I-teams - 211 participants from DK-teams) and during the I-project (245 participants from I-teams - 575 from DK-teams). During the I-project  the I-teams' course evaluations increased to acceptable values and to levels comparable to the evaluation scores of DK-teams. Furthermore  I-students now considered that their communication with the patients was acceptable. Before the I-project  I-students had lower exam grades (median = 10 (range: 0-12)) than DK-students (10 (4-12)) (p = 0.03)  but during the I-project  exam grades increased to the levels achieved by DK-students (10 (2-12) - 10 (0-12) (p = 0.22)  and no more I- than DK-students failed exams (p = 0.51). Pairing students for clinical training and allocating an exclusive lecturer for I-teams produced improved courses for internationalisation. Allocating an exclusive lecturer was associated with a cost of about 615 EUR per student per course when the team consisted of ten students. The Capital Region of Denmark and the University of Copenhagen. not relevant.
Neurology,,,Management of dystonia in Europe: a survey of the European network for the study of the dystonia syndromes. Dystonia is difficult to recognize due to its large phenomenological complexity. Thus  the use of experts in dystonia is essential for better recognition and management of dystonia syndromes (DS). Our aim was to document managing strategies  facilities and expertise available in various European countries in order to identify which measures should be implemented to improve the management of DS. A survey was conducted  funded by the Cooperation in Science and Technology  via the management committee of the European network for the study of DS  which is formed from representatives of the 24 countries involved. Lack of specific training in dystonia by general neurologists  general practitioners as well as other allied health professionals was universal in all countries surveyed. Genetic testing for rare dystonia mutations is not readily available in a significant number of countries and neurophysiological studies are difficult to perform due to a lack of experts in this field of movement disorders. Tetrabenazine is only readily available for treatment of dystonia in half of the surveyed countries. Deep brain stimulation is available in three-quarters of the countries  but other surgical procedures are only available in one-quarter of countries. Internationally  collaboration in training  advanced diagnosis  treatment and research of DS and  locally  in each country the creation of multidisciplinary teams for the management of dystonia patients could provide the basis for improving all aspects of dystonia management across Europe.
General Practice,,,Good quality of oral anticoagulation treatment in general practice using international normalised ratio point of care testing. Oral anticoagulation treatment (OACT) with warfarin is common in general practice. Increasingly  international normalised ratio (INR) point of care testing (POCT) is being used to manage patients. The aim of this study was to describe and analyse the quality of OACT with warfarin in general practice in the Capital Region of Denmark using INR POCT. A total of 20 general practices  ten single-handed and ten group practices using INR POCT  were randomly selected to participate in the study. Practice organisation and patient characteristics were recorded. INR measurements were collected retrospectively for a period of six months. For each patient  time in therapeutic range (TTR) was calculated and correlated with practice and patient characteristics using multilevel linear regression models. We identified 447 patients in warfarin treatment in the 20 practices using POCT (median = 19 patients; range: 6-55). The mean TTR for all patients was 69.3% (standard deviation (SD) = 24%)  and for all practices the mean TTR was 67.3% (SD = 6.7%). The TTR in single-handed practices was lower than in group practices  64.6% (SD = 8.0%) and 70.0% (SD = 3.6%)  respectively; but the difference was not significant (4.2 percentage points (pp); 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.8-9.2). Short sampling intervals  e.g. 10-20 days (-11 pp; 95% CI: -16-6)) and lack of diagnostic coding (-11.8 pp; 95% CI: -19.9-3.7) were correlated with a low TTR. In our study most of the general practices using INR POCT in the management of patients in warfarin treatment provided good quality of care. Sampling interval and diagnostic coding were significantly correlated with treatment quality.
Midwifery,,,Uterine contraction induced by Tanzanian plants used to induce abortion. Women in Tanzania use plants to induce abortion. It is not known whether the plants have an effect. Collect data on plant use in relation to induced abortion and test the effect of plant extracts on uterine contraction. During interviews with traditional birth attendants and nurses  plants were identified. Cumulative doses of plant extracts were added to rat uterine tissue in an organ bath  and the force and frequency of contractions recorded. Acetylcholine was used as positive control. 21 plant species were tested for effect on uterine contraction. 11 species increased the force of contraction  and 12 species the frequency of contractions. The strongest contractions comparable to the maximum response obtained with acetylcholine were obtained with extracts of Bidens pilosa  Commelina africana  Desmodium barbatum  Manihot esculenta  Ocimum suave  Oldenlandia corymbosa and Sphaerogyne latifolia. 7 species increased both the force and frequency of contractions. Several of the plant species induced strong and frequent contractions of the uterus  and can be used to induce an abortion.
Computational Biology,,,G-protein coupled receptor signaling architecture of mammalian immune cells. A series of recent studies on large-scale networks of signaling and metabolic systems revealed that a certain network structure often called "bow-tie network" are observed. In signaling systems  bow-tie network takes a form with diverse and redundant inputs and outputs connected via a small numbers of core molecules. While arguments have been made that such network architecture enhances robustness and evolvability of biological systems  its functional role at a cellular level remains obscure. A hypothesis was proposed that such a network function as a stimuli-reaction classifier where dynamics of core molecules dictate downstream transcriptional activities  hence physiological responses against stimuli. In this study  we examined whether such hypothesis can be verified using experimental data from Alliance for Cellular Signaling (AfCS) that comprehensively measured GPCR related ligands response for B-cell and macrophage. In a GPCR signaling system  cAMP and Ca2+ act as core molecules. Stimuli-response for 32 ligands to B-Cells and 23 ligands to macrophages has been measured. We found that ligands with correlated changes of cAMP and Ca2+ tend to cluster closely together within the hyperspaces of both cell types and they induced genes involved in the same cellular processes. It was found that ligands inducing cAMP synthesis activate genes involved in cell growth and proliferation; cAMP and Ca2+ molecules that increased together form a feedback loop and induce immune cells to migrate and adhere together. In contrast  ligands without a core molecules response are scattered throughout the hyperspace and do not share clusters. G-protein coupling receptors together with immune response specific receptors were found in cAMP and Ca2+ activated clusters. Analyses have been done on the original software applicable for discovering 'bow-tie' network architectures within the complex network of intracellular signaling where ab initio clustering has been implemented as well. Groups of potential transcription factors for each specific group of genes were found to be partly conserved across B-cell and macrophage. A series of findings support the hypothesis.
Genetics,,,Etiological influences on the stability of autistic traits from childhood to early adulthood: evidence from a twin study. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are persistent and lifelong conditions. Despite this  almost all twin studies focus on childhood. This twin study investigated the stability of autistic traits from childhood to early adulthood and explored the degree to which any stability could be explained by genetic or environmental factors. Parents of over 2500 twin pairs completed questionnaires assessing autistic traits when twins were aged either 9 or 12 years and again when twins were aged 18. Bivariate twin analysis assessed the degree of phenotypic and etiological stability in autistic traits across this period. Genetic overlap in autistic traits across development was also tested in individuals displaying a broad ASD phenotype  defined as scoring within the highest 5% of the sample. Autistic traits displayed moderate phenotypic stability (r = .39). The heritability of autistic traits was 76-77% in childhood and 60-62% in adulthood. A moderate degree of genetic influences on childhood autistic traits were carried across into adulthood (genetic correlation = .49). The majority (85%) of the stability in autistic traits was attributable to genetic factors. Genetic influences on autistic traits were moderately stable from childhood to early adulthood at the extremes (genetic correlation = .64). Broad autistic traits display moderate phenotypic and etiological stability from childhood to early adulthood. Genetic factors accounted for almost all phenotypic stability  although there was some phenotypic and etiological instability in autistic traits. Thus  autistic traits in adulthood are influenced by a combination of enduring and unique genetic factors.
Epidemiology,,,Low renal replacement therapy incidence among slowly progressing elderly chronic kidney disease patients referred to nephrology care: an observational study. Elderly patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a high risk of death before reaching end-stage kidney disease. In order to allocate resources  such as advanced care nephrology where it is most needed  it is essential to know which patients have the highest absolute risk of advancing to renal replacement therapy (RRT). We included all nephrology-referred CKD stage 3b-5 patients in Sweden 2005-2011 included in the Swedish renal registry (SRR-CKD) who had at least two serum creatinine measurements one year apart (+/- 6 months). We followed these patients to either initiation of RRT  death  or September 30  2013. Decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (%) was estimated during the one-year baseline period. The patients in the highest tertile of progression (>18.7% decline in eGFR) during the initial year of follow-up were classified as "fast progressors". We estimated the cumulative incidence of RRT and death before RRT by age  eGFR and progression status using competing risk models. There were 2119 RRT initiations (24.2%) and 2060 deaths (23.5%) before RRT started. The median progression rate estimated during the initial year was -8.8% (Interquartile range [IQR] - 24.5-6.5%). A fast initial progression rate was associated with a higher risk of RRT initiation (Sub Hazard Ratio [SHR] 2.24 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.00-2.51) and also a higher risk of death before RRT initiation (SHR 1.27 (95% CI 1.13-1.43). The five year probability of RRT was highest in younger patients (<65 years) with fast initial progression rate (51% in CKD stage 4 and 76% in stage 5)  low overall in patients >75 years with a slow progression rate (7  13  and 25% for CKD stages 3b  4 and 5 respectively)  and slightly higher in elderly patients with a fast initial progression rate (28% in CKD stage 4 and 47% in CKD stage 5) or with diabetic kidney disease. The 5-year probability of RRT was low among referred slowly progressing CKD patients >75 years of age because of the competing risk of death.
Genetics,,,Genetic Screening of WNT4 and WNT5B in Two Populations with Deviating Bone Mineral Densities. A role for WNT4 and WNT5B in bone metabolism was indicated by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and a Wnt4 knockout mouse model. The aim of this study was therefore to replicate and further investigate the causality between genetic variation in WNT4 and WNT5B and deviating bone mineral density (BMD) values. A WNT4 and WNT5B mutation screening was performed in patients with craniotubular hyperostosis using Sanger sequencing. Here  no putative causal mutations were detected. Moreover  a high and low BMD cohort was selected from the Odense Androgen Study population for re-sequencing. In WNT4 we detected four variants (three rare  one common)  while in WNT5B we detected five variants (two rare  three common). For the common variants  no significant difference in genotype frequencies between the high and low BMD cohorts was observed. The SNPs associated with the GWAS were genotyped in these cohorts  but again no significant difference in genotype frequencies was observed. Despite the findings of the GWAS  we were not able to replicate or further verify the genetic association of polymorphisms in WNT4 and WNT5B with BMD. In order to do so  the intronic regions of both genes could be investigated more thoroughly in more extended populations (or extremes) with greater power. Future genetic and functional studies toward adjacent genes of WNT4 and WNT5B can also be interesting to figure out whether the signal from GWAS could possibly be attributed to genetic variation in these genes.
Epidemiology,,,Cardiovascular disease in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta - a nationwide  register-based cohort study. Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a hereditary connective tissue disease often due to mutations in genes coding for type 1 collagen. Collagen type 1 is important in the development of the heart and vasculature. Little is known about the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in OI. To investigate the risk of symptomatic CVD in OI. A Danish nationwide  population-based and register-based longitudinal open cohort study. All patients registered with the diagnosis of OI from 1977 to 2013 and a reference population matched 5:1 to the OI cohort. Sub-hazard ratios for mitral and aortic valve regurgitation  atrial fibrillation and flutter  heart failure and vascular aneurisms and dissections comparing the OI cohort to the reference population. We identified 687 cases with OI (379 women) and included 3435 reference persons (1895 women). The SHR was 6.3 [95% CI: 2.5-15.5] for mitral valve regurgitation  4.5 [95% CI: 1.4-13.9] for aortic valve regurgitation  1.7 [95% CI: 1.1-2.8] for atrial fibrillation/flutter  and 2.3 [95% CI: 1.4-3.7] for heart failure. The SHRs were not increased arterial aneurisms or dissections. Our results were limited by lacking clinical information about phenotype and genotype of the included patients. We confirm that patients with OI have an increased risk of CVD compared to the general population. This held true even when adjusting for factors that are known to contribute to development of these diseases. Our results suggest that the collagenopathy seen in OI may be part of the pathogenesis of CVD in OI.
Pediatrics,,,Impact of communication skills training on parents perceptions of care: intervention study. This paper is a report of a study of the effects of communication-skills training for healthcare professionals on parents' perceptions of information  care and continuity. As training in communication skills has been more and more integrated into clinical practice it has been subject to an increasing number of studies. However  the majority of studies have been conducted in outpatient clinics  have only targeted physicians  and have not been evaluated from the perspective of patients. This intervention study  conducted from 2005 to 2007  was performed to investigate the effect of a 3-day communication course offered to all healthcare professionals in a department of paediatrics. In a pre-/post-test design  the effect of the intervention was evaluated by the parents using electronic questionnaires filled in on touch-screen computers located centrally in the wards. A total of 895 parents answered the questionnaires before the course (80%) and 1937 answered after the course (72%). For the questions on care and continuity  the proportion of satisfied parents increased statistically significantly for 4 out of 13 questions  e.g. Did you feel that the staff understood you situation? and Did you find that the information given by the different nurses was consistent? For the information questions  no statistically significant differences were found. It is possible to incorporate key communication skills into clinical practice by targeting all healthcare professionals. Communication skills training using interactive methods such as role-play and feedback on video recordings is recommended.
Chiropractic,,,Health care encounters in Danish chiropractic practice from a consumer perspectives - a mixed methods investigation. Perceived value is the key ingredient to carving and maintaining a competitive business niche. The opportunities to interact with consumers to understand and enhance perceived value are termed 'touch points'. Due to the out-of-pocket expense incurred by patients  Danish chiropractors are subject to consumer trends and behaviors. The purpose of this investigation was to explore and describe consumer touch points relevant to perceived value through healthcare journeys in chiropractic practices. We designed a convergent parallel  mixed methods study. Our purposive sampling framework identified 11 chiropractic clinics from which we collected observational field notes  video recordings and face-to-face interviews. Data was collected between April 14(th) and June 26(th) 2014. We described the exteriors and interiors of all participant clinics  interviewed 32 staff members  12 new patients and 36 follow-up patients and finally video recorded 11 new and 24 follow-up consultations. Categorization and analysis led to the emergence six consumer touch point themes: 'the internet'  'the physical environment'  'practice models'  'administrative staff'  'the consultation sequence and timing' and 'a consultation that adds value'. The Internet functions as a tool when choosing/confirming a clinic as appropriate  developing and initial image and managing appointments. The administrative hub appears integral to the shaping of positive consumer experiences outside of the consultation. Clinic location  practice model and interior design may contribute to context effects and thus may influence value perception during the clinical encounter. The duration of hands-on treatment received from the chiropractor is not an apparent consumer focus point. Rather  through a seven stage clinical procedure patients value consultations with clinicians who demonstrate professional competence by effective communication diagnosis/management and facilitating satisfactory treatment outcomes. At least six consumer touch points add/detract from value-related experiences in chiropractic practices. The duration of hands-on treatment per se does not appear to be a particular focus point. More research is required to explore this issue.
Chiropractic,,,The chiropractic profession in Denmark 2010-2014: a descriptive report. The chiropractic profession has been well established in Denmark for several decades with state authorization  partial reimbursement by the state and a formal academic education. Biennial systematic data collections among all chiropractors and clinics have been performed since 2010 in order to provide exact information on the profession to The Danish Chiropractic Association (DCA). It is the aim of this study to outline the major characteristics and developments of the chiropractic profession in Denmark to make this information accessible to other stakeholders  domestic as well as foreign. Using contact information from the DCA  two questionnaires were distributed electronically to all individual members of the association actively working as chiropractors and all clinics respectively in 2010  2012 and 2014. The questions asked were developed for this specific survey. Response rates varied between 59 and 78 % for the clinic questionnaires and 75 to 86 % for the individual questionnaires. Almost half the Danish chiropractors were educated in Denmark and a small majority was female. The average Danish chiropractor of 2014 was 44 years old  graduated 17 years earlier  and worked full time in a primary care clinic with at least one colleague. Half the chiropractors spent more than 20 h a year on continued professional development. Danish chiropractic clinics had a median of 3 treatment rooms  most had digital X-ray equipment  around 6 out of 10 had exercise facilities  and 1 out of 4 employed a physiotherapist. Three out of 4 clinics employed a secretary  too. The average duration of a consultation was 40 min for a new patient and 13 min for a follow-up consultation. Virtually all Danish chiropractors working in the primary sector made use of manipulation as one of their treatment modalities. This is the first study to describe the state and latest development of the chiropractic profession in Denmark using repeated surveys. Displaying various characteristics of both clinics and individual chiropractors  the image emerging is one of a stable profession where rapid or drastic changes are not taking place over short intervals of time.
Chiropractic,,,Compensation claims for chiropractic in Denmark and Norway 2004-2012. Adverse events are commonly observed in all parts of health care and have been reported extensively following manual therapy  including chiropractic. The majority of reported adverse events following chiropractic care are mild  transitory and self-limiting. However  little is known about patient filed compensation claims related to the chiropractic consultation process. The aim of this study was to describe claims reported to the Danish Patient Compensation Association and the Norwegian System of Compensation to Patients related to chiropractic from 2004 to 2012. All finalized compensation claims involving chiropractors reported to one of the two associations between 2004 and 2012 were assessed for age  gender  type of complaint  decisions and appeals. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the study population. 338 claims were registered in Denmark and Norway between 2004 and 2012 of which 300 were included in the analysis. 41 (13.7%) were approved for financial compensation. The most frequent complaints were worsening of symptoms following treatment (n = 91  30.3%)  alleged disk herniations (n = 57  19%) and cases with delayed referral (n = 46  15.3%). A total financial payment of €2 305 757 (median payment €7 730) were distributed among the forty-one cases with complaints relating to a few cases of cervical artery dissection (n = 11  5.7%) accounting for 88.7% of the total amount. Chiropractors in Denmark and Norway received approximately one compensation claim per 100.000 consultations. The approval rate was low across the majority of complaint categories and lower than the approval rates for general practioners and physiotherapists. Many claims can probably be prevented if chiropractors would prioritize informing patients about the normal course of their complaint and normal benign reactions to treatment.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Pelvic floor muscle training in pregnant and parturient women--a survey of a Cochrane review]. Urinary and anal incontinence are prevalent in pregnant and parturient women. Pelvic floor muscle training is frequently employed for prevention and treatment. A recent Cochrane review is discussed. Fifteen studies with a total of 6 181 women were included. Pregnant women without urinary incontinence experienced a reduction of the risk of developing urinary incontinence in later pregnancy or post partum. Peripartum patients with urinary and anal incontinence experienced a reduction of their symptoms following training.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Oestrogen for prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections in postmenopausal women--a survey of a Cochrane review]. Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in postmenopausal women. While the pathophysiology is often complex  it is evident that the urogenital atrophy due to the decrease of endogenous oestrogen production is a key factor. Two small randomized controlled studies have proven the efficacy of local (vaginal) oestrogen therapy in the prevention of recurrent UTIs. Conversely  four randomized trials  reviewed in a weighted meta-analysis with pooled data from 2 798 women  have shown the lack of efficacy of systemic oestrogen-progesterone therapy. Local oestrogen therapy is recommended  if the predominant indication is urogenital symptoms.
Biomedical Research,,,Who is healthy? Aspects to consider when including healthy volunteers in QST--based studies-a consensus statement by the EUROPAIN and NEUROPAIN consortia. Clinical and human experimental pain studies often include so-called "healthy" controls in investigations of sensory abnormalities  using quantitative sensory testing (QST) as an outcome measure. However  the criteria for what is considered "healthy" vary among the different studies and between study centers and investigators  partly explaining the high variability of the results. Therefore  several aspects should be considered during inclusion of healthy volunteers in QST-based trials to have homogenous groups of healthy controls with less variability between human experimental studies  so that results are less likely to be false negative or false positive because of subject-related factors. The EUROPAIN and NEUROPAIN consortia aimed to define factors influencing the variability in selection of healthy subjects in QST-based studies before the start of both projects and to give recommendations how to minimize it based on the current literature and expertise of the participants. The present suggestions for inclusion criteria of healthy volunteers into QST-based trials describe a 2-level approach including standardized questionnaires enabling the collection of relevant information on sociodemographic data  medical history  current health status  coping strategies in dealing with pain  and the motivation of the volunteer to participate in the study. These suggestions are believed to help researchers interpret their results in comparison with others and improve the quality of clinical studies including healthy volunteers as controls or in human experimental pain studies. They aim to reduce any confounding factors. Furthermore  the acquired information will allow post hoc analyses of variance for different potential influencing factors.
Research Design,,,Research designs for proof-of-concept chronic pain clinical trials: IMMPACT recommendations. Proof-of-concept (POC) clinical trials play an important role in developing novel treatments and determining whether existing treatments may be efficacious in broader populations of patients. The goal of most POC trials is to determine whether a treatment is likely to be efficacious for a given indication and thus whether it is worth investing the financial resources and participant exposure necessary for a confirmatory trial of that intervention. A challenge in designing POC trials is obtaining sufficient information to make this important go/no-go decision in a cost-effective manner. An IMMPACT consensus meeting was convened to discuss design considerations for POC trials in analgesia  with a focus on maximizing power with limited resources and participants. We present general design aspects to consider including patient population  active comparators and placebos  study power  pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships  and minimization of missing data. Efficiency of single-dose studies for treatments with rapid onset is discussed. The trade-off between parallel-group and crossover designs with respect to overall sample sizes  trial duration  and applicability is summarized. The advantages and disadvantages of more recent trial designs  including N-of-1 designs  enriched designs  adaptive designs  and sequential parallel comparison designs  are summarized  and recommendations for consideration are provided. More attention to identifying efficient yet powerful designs for POC clinical trials of chronic pain treatments may increase the percentage of truly efficacious pain treatments that are advanced to confirmatory trials while decreasing the percentage of ineffective treatments that continue to be evaluated rather than abandoned.
Outcome Assessment (Health Care),,,Influence of reported study design characteristics on intervention effect estimates from randomised controlled trials: combined analysis of meta-epidemiological studies. The design of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) should incorporate characteristics (such as concealment of randomised allocation and blinding of participants and personnel) that avoid biases resulting from lack of comparability of the intervention and control groups. Empirical evidence suggests that the absence of such characteristics leads to biased intervention effect estimates  but the findings of different studies are not consistent. To examine the influence of unclear or inadequate random sequence generation and allocation concealment  and unclear or absent double blinding  on intervention effect estimates and between-trial heterogeneity  and whether or not these influences vary with type of clinical area  intervention  comparison and outcome measure. Data were combined from seven contributing meta-epidemiological studies (collections of meta-analyses in which trial characteristics are assessed and results recorded). The resulting database was used to identify and remove overlapping meta-analyses. Outcomes were coded such that odds ratios < 1 correspond to beneficial intervention effects. Outcome measures were classified as mortality  other objective or subjective. We examined agreement between assessments of trial characteristics in trials assessed in more than one contributing study. We used hierarchical Bayesian bias models to estimate the effect of trial characteristics on average bias [quantified as ratios of odds ratios (RORs) with 95% credible intervals (CrIs) comparing trials with and without a characteristic] and in increasing between-trial heterogeneity. The analysis data set contained 1973 trials included in 234 meta-analyses. Median kappa statistics for agreement between assessments of trial characteristics were: sequence generation 0.60  allocation concealment 0.58 and blinding 0.87. Intervention effect estimates were exaggerated by an average 11% in trials with inadequate or unclear (compared with adequate) sequence generation (ROR 0.89  95% CrI 0.82 to 0.96); between-trial heterogeneity was higher among such trials. Bias associated with inadequate or unclear sequence generation was greatest for subjective outcomes (ROR 0.83  95% CrI 0.74 to 0.94) and the increase in heterogeneity was greatest for such outcomes [standard deviation (SD) 0.20  95% CrI 0.03 to 0.32]. The effect of inadequate or unclear (compared with adequate) allocation concealment was greatest among meta-analyses with a subjectively assessed outcome intervention effect (ROR 0.85  95% CrI 0.75 to 0.95)  and the increase in between-trial heterogeneity was also greatest for such outcomes (SD 0.20  95% CrI 0.02 to 0.33). Lack of  or unclear  double blinding (compared with double blinding) was associated with an average 13% exaggeration of intervention effects (ROR 0.87  95% CrI 0.79 to 0.96)  and between-trial heterogeneity was increased for such studies (SD 0.14  95% CrI 0.02 to 0.30). Average bias (ROR 0.78  95% CrI 0.65 to 0.92) and between-trial heterogeneity (SD 0.37  95% CrI 0.19 to 0.53) were greatest for meta-analyses assessing subjective outcomes. Among meta-analyses with subjectively assessed outcomes  the effect of lack of blinding appeared greater than the effect of inadequate or unclear sequence generation or allocation concealment. Bias associated with specific reported study design characteristics leads to exaggeration of beneficial intervention effect estimates and increases in between-trial heterogeneity. For each of the three characteristics assessed  these effects were greatest for subjectively assessed outcomes. Assessments of the risk of bias in RCTs should account for these findings. Further research is needed to understand the effects of attrition bias  as well as the relative importance of blinding of patients  care-givers and outcome assessors  and thus separate the effects of performance and detection bias.

Research Design,,,Influence of reported study design characteristics on intervention effect estimates from randomized  controlled trials. Published evidence suggests that aspects of trial design lead to biased intervention effect estimates  but findings from different studies are inconsistent. This study combined data from 7 meta-epidemiologic studies and removed overlaps to derive a final data set of 234 unique meta-analyses containing 1973 trials. Outcome measures were classified as "mortality " "other objective " "or subjective " and Bayesian hierarchical models were used to estimate associations of trial characteristics with average bias and between-trial heterogeneity. Intervention effect estimates seemed to be exaggerated in trials with inadequate or unclear (vs. adequate) random-sequence generation (ratio of odds ratios  0.89 [95% credible interval {CrI}  0.82 to 0.96]) and with inadequate or unclear (vs. adequate) allocation concealment (ratio of odds ratios  0.93 [CrI  0.87 to 0.99]). Lack of or unclear double-blinding (vs. double-blinding) was associated with an average of 13% exaggeration of intervention effects (ratio of odds ratios  0.87 [CrI  0.79 to 0.96])  and between-trial heterogeneity was increased for such studies (SD increase in heterogeneity  0.14 [CrI  0.02 to 0.30]). For each characteristic  average bias and increases in between-trial heterogeneity were driven primarily by trials with subjective outcomes  with little evidence of bias in trials with objective and mortality outcomes. This study is limited by incomplete trial reporting  and findings may be confounded by other study design characteristics. Bias associated with study design characteristics may lead to exaggeration of intervention effect estimates and increases in between-trial heterogeneity in trials reporting subjectively assessed outcomes.
Nanotechnology,Optics and Photonics,,Aligned hemozoin crystals in curved clusters in malarial red blood cells revealed by nanoprobe X-ray Fe fluorescence and diffraction. The human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum detoxifies the heme byproduct of hemoglobin digestion in infected red blood cells by sequestration into submicron-sized hemozoin crystals. The crystal is composed of heme units interlinked to form cyclic dimers via reciprocal Fe─O (propionate) bonds. Templated hemozoin nucleation was envisaged to explain a classic observation by electron microscopy of a cluster of aligned hemozoin crystals within the parasite digestive vacuole. This dovetails with evidence that acylglycerol lipids are involved in hemozoin nucleation in vivo  and nucleation of β-hematin  the synthetic analogue of hemozoin  was consistently induced at an acylglycerol-water interface via their {100} crystal faces. In order to ascertain the nature of hemozoin nucleation in vivo  we probed the mutual orientations of hemozoin crystals in situ within RBCs using synchrotron-based X-ray nanoprobe Fe fluorescence and diffraction. The X-ray patterns indicated the presence of hemozoin clusters  each comprising several crystals aligned along their needle c axes and exposing {100} side faces to an approximately cylindrical surface  suggestive of nucleation via a common lipid layer. This experimental finding  and the associated nucleation model  are difficult to reconcile with recent reports of hemozoin formation within lipid droplets in the digestive vacuole. The diffraction results are verified by a study of the nucleation process using emerging tools of three-dimensional cellular microscopy  described in the companion paper.
Evidence-Based Medicine,Gastroenterology,,Hepato-biliary clinical trials and their inclusion in the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group register and reviews. The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group (CHBG) is one of the 52 collaborative review groups within The Cochrane Collaboration. The activities of the CHBG focus on collecting hepato-biliary randomized clinical trials (RCT) and controlled clinical trials (CCT)  and including them in systematic reviews with meta-analyses of the trials. In this overview  we present the growth of The CHBG Controlled Trials Register  as well as the systematic reviews that have been produced since March 1996. The CHBG register includes almost 11 000 RCT and 700 CCT publications. The earliest RCT in the register were published in 1955  and the earliest CCT in 1945. From 1945 to 1980  there were less than 100 publications each year. From 1981 to 1997  their number increased from over 100 to 600 a year. After 1997  the number of publications seems to have been decreasing. The CHBG has published 199 protocols for systematic reviews and 107 systematic reviews through to August 2009 in which 21% of the RCT and CCT were included. The CHBG reviews have been cited approximately 1200 times. A large amount of work has been carried out since 1996. However  there is still much to do  as the CHBG register contains a great number of RCT and CCT on topics that have not yet been systematically reviewed.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Oral versus intravenous antibiotic therapy for pyelonephritis in the paediatric patient--a survey of a Cochrane review]. Acute pyelonephritis is a common bacterial infection in children. The recommended treatment in Denmark is intravenous ampiciline and gentamycin for at least three days followed by oral antibiotics. The available evidence indicates that oral antibiotics may be as effective as initial intravenous treatment of children with a first attack of pyelonephritis. However  there are no Danish microbiological studies covering broad-spectrum oral antibiotics to children with pyelonephritis. This impedes generalisation to Danish practice.
Research Design,,,Can trial sequential monitoring boundaries reduce spurious inferences from meta-analyses? Results from apparently conclusive meta-analyses may be false. A limited number of events from a few small trials and the associated random error may be under-recognized sources of spurious findings. The information size (IS  i.e. number of participants) required for a reliable and conclusive meta-analysis should be no less rigorous than the sample size of a single  optimally powered randomized clinical trial. If a meta-analysis is conducted before a sufficient IS is reached  it should be evaluated in a manner that accounts for the increased risk that the result might represent a chance finding (i.e. applying trial sequential monitoring boundaries). We analysed 33 meta-analyses with a sufficient IS to detect a treatment effect of 15% relative risk reduction (RRR). We successively monitored the results of the meta-analyses by generating interim cumulative meta-analyses after each included trial and evaluated their results using a conventional statistical criterion (alpha = 0.05) and two-sided Lan-DeMets monitoring boundaries. We examined the proportion of false positive results and important inaccuracies in estimates of treatment effects that resulted from the two approaches. Using the random-effects model and final data  12 of the meta-analyses yielded P > alpha = 0.05  and 21 yielded P </= alpha = 0.05. False positive interim results were observed in 3 out of 12 meta-analyses with P > alpha = 0.05. The monitoring boundaries eliminated all false positives. Important inaccuracies in estimates were observed in 6 out of 21 meta-analyses using the conventional P </= alpha = 0.05 and 0 out of 21 using the monitoring boundaries. Evaluating statistical inference with trial sequential monitoring boundaries when meta-analyses fall short of a required IS may reduce the risk of false positive results and important inaccurate effect estimates.
Research Design,Statistics as Topic,,Blinded trials taken to the test: an analysis of randomized clinical trials that report tests for the success of blinding. Blinding can reduce bias in randomized clinical trials  but blinding procedures may be unsuccessful. Our aim was to assess how often randomized clinical trials test the success of blinding  the methods involved and how often blinding is reported as being successful. We analysed a random sample of blinded randomized clinical trials indexed in the The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and published in 2001. We identified 1599 blinded trials  and noted if they had conducted any test for the success of blinding. We also selected 200 trials randomly that did not report any such test  and sent a questionnaire to the corresponding authors asking them if they had conducted any tests. Thirty-one out of 1599 trials (2%) reported tests for the success of blinding. Test methods varied  and reporting was generally incomplete. Blinding was considered successful in 14 out of the 31 trials (45%) and unclear in 10 (32%). Of the seven trials (23%) reporting unsuccessful blinding the risk of a biased trial result was either not addressed or was discounted in six cases. We received 130 questionnaires from trial authors (65%) of which 15 (12%) informed that they had conducted  but not published  tests. Blinding is rarely tested. Test methods vary  and the reporting of tests  and test results  is incomplete. There is a considerable methodological uncertainty how best to assess blinding  and an urgent need for improved methodology and improved reporting.
Clinical Competence,Education  Nursing  Continuing,,Nurse-administered propofol sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures: first Nordic results from implementation of a structured training program. Proper training to improve safety of NAPS (nurse-administered propofol sedation) is essential. To communicate our experience with a training program of NAPS. In 2007  a training program was introduced for endoscopists and endoscopy nurses in collaboration with the Department of Anaesthesiology. During a 2.5-year period  eight nurses were trained. Propofol was given as monotherapy. The training program for nurses consisted of a 6-week course including theoretical and practical training whereas the training program for endoscopists consisted of 2.5 h of theory. Patients were selected based on strict criteria including patients in ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) group I-III. 2527 patients undergoing 2.656 gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures were included. The patients were ASA group I  II and III in 34.7%  56% and 9 3%  respectively. Median dose of propofol was 300 mg. No mortality was noted. 119 of 2527 patients developed short lasting hypoxia (4.7%); 61 (2.4%) needed suction; 22 (0.9%) required bag-mask ventilation and 8 (0.3%) procedures had to be discontinued. In 11 patients (0.4%)  anesthetic assistance was called due to short lasting desaturation. 34 patients (1.3%) experienced a change in blood pressure greater than 30%. NAPS provided by properly trained nurses according to the present protocol is safe and only associated with a minor risk (short lasting hypoxia 4.7%). National or international structured training programs are at present few or non-existing. The present training program has documented its value and is suggested as the basis for the current development of guidelines.
Physical Education and Training,,,Voluntary respiratory control and cerebral blood flow velocity upon ice-water immersion. In non-habituated subjects  cold-shock response to cold-water immersion causes rapid reduction in cerebral blood flow velocity (approximately 50%) due to hyperventilation  increasing risk of syncope  aspiration  and drowning. Adaptation to the response is possible  but requires several cold immersions. This study examines whether thorough instruction enables non-habituated persons to attenuate the ventilatory component of cold-shock response. There were nine volunteers (four women) who were lowered into a 0 degrees C immersion tank for 60 s. Middle cerebral artery mean velocity (CBFV) was measured together with ventilatory parameters and heart rate before  during  and after immersion. Within seconds after immersion in ice-water  heart rate increased significantly from 95 +/- 8 to 126 +/- 7 bpm (mean +/- SEM). Immersion was associated with an elevation in respiratory rate (from 12 +/- 3 to 21 +/- 5 breaths  min(-1)) and tidal volume (1022 +/- 142 to 1992 +/- 253 ml). Though end-tidal carbon dioxide tension decreased from 4.9 +/- 0.13 to 3.9 +/- 0.21 kPa  CBFV was insignificantly reduced by 7 +/- 4% during immersion with a brief nadir of 21 +/- 4%. Even without prior cold-water experience  subjects were able to suppress reflex hyperventilation following ice-water immersion  maintaining the cerebral blood flow velocity at a level not associated with impaired consciousness. This study implies that those susceptible to accidental cold-water immersion could benefit from education in cold-shock response and the possibility of reducing the ventilatory response voluntarily.
Clinical Competence,,,[Postoperative urinary retention. Clinical assessment versus ultrasound examination]. Postoperative urinary retention can cause serious complications. An ultrasound bladderscanner has been shown to be useful in distinguishing between patients who need catheterisation and patients who do not. We wished to investigate if clinical assessment including inspection  percussion and palpation of the bladder is of any use in this perspective. In this study we compare clinical findings with ultrasound examinations. Two trained doctors each investigated 25 postoperative patients clinically immediately after ultrasound examination in the recovery room. Ultrasound examination was carried out by trained nurses using BladderScan BVI 3000. Assessed and measured volumes as well as patient height  weight  asa-class and sex were registered. We found a high negative predictive value of 92% for a cut-off limit of 500 ml. The corresponding positive predictive value was a modest 38%. This tendency was seen for cut-off-limits exceeding 300 ml. Clinical assessment of bladder size might be useful in terms of ruling out a big volume postoperatively. Because of the low positive predictive value  we recommend verifying urinary retention judged by clinical assessment with ultrasound examination before catheterisation. Also  one has to remember that urinary retention occurs with different volumes in different patients.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Campaigns for patient safety and quality improvement - do they work?]. The number of published scientific articles has been increasing for several years. Implementation of evidence-based knowledge in clinical practice is  however  lagging behind. Patient safety campaigns suggest that the implementation of best practice can be accelerated. The Danish Operation Life Campaign is based on rests on a model used in the American 100K Lives Campaign in order to achieve this goal. Campaigns suffer from the inability of the methods to prove a relationship between intervention and results. However  from the patients' point of view  any improvement in quality and safety is a success.
Global Health,,,Global Changes in Food Supply and the Obesity Epidemic. We explore how a global shift in the food system caused by global economic growth  increase in available food per capita and in food processing is a driver of the obesity epidemic. Economic development in most areas of the world has resulted in increased purchasing power and available per capita food. Supermarkets and a growing fast-food industry have transformed our dietary pattern. Ultra-processed food rich on sugars and saturated fat is now the major source of energy in most countries. The shift in food supply is considered a major driver of the obesity epidemic and the increasing prevalence of accompanying complications  such as type 2 diabetes  cardiovascular disease and cancer. However  the global shift might also have direct effects on the increase in type 2 diabetes  cardiovascular disease and cancer  independently of overweight and obesity. The shift in the food supply is a major driver of the obesity epidemic.
Biomedical Research,Systems Integration,Telemedicine,Participatory design in health sciences: Using cooperative experimental methods in developing health services and computer technology. Participatory design (PD) is a research approach to the development of technological solutions to real-world problems  an approach that shares many concerns and some of its roots with action research. In this article  the authors discuss their experience in conducting a PD research project intended to develop a technological and a related organizational intervention to support the treatment of foot ulcers for people with diabetes at home. They provide a historical overview of the PD approach and a description of how they used it in their research study. They describe their experience in conducting the research  including the participants' responses  the outcomes of the research  and the challenges confronted in bridging the practical and disciplinary issues that arose. In the conclusion  they propose that PD holds potential as a research approach that might effectively merge computer technology and health-related interventional research.
Otolaryngology,,,Retrospective analysis of use and distribution of resources in otolaryngology wards in Romanian hospitals between 2003 and 2008 to improve provision and financial performance of healthcare services. To analyze use and distribution of resources by otolaryngology (ENT) hospital wards in Romania between 2003 and 2008  in order to plan the improvement of patient access to health care services and health care services' financial performance. Clinical electronic records were searched for all patients discharged from all public hospitals funded on a per-case basis by the government between January 2003 and September 2008. Adult and pediatric ENT wards  as well as ENT wards from different counties  were compared. The number of ENT hospital beds and the number of specialists decreased from 2003 to 2004  the number of specialists declined  and specialists were distributed unevenly among the hospitals and counties. The total number of ENT wards was over 100 for almost the entire study period  but there were only about 15 pediatric ENT wards in all 42 counties. ENT wards recorded more cases and hospitalization days than oral-maxillofacial surgery and neurosurgery wards  but fewer cases than general surgery or obstetrics wards. ENT wards had the lowest mortality rates. Until the second half of 2007  adult ENT wards had a lower surgical index  higher complexity of cases  and longer average length of stay than pediatric ENT wards (P<0.001  t-test). After 2007  pediatric ENT wards treated more complex cases (P=0.004  t -test) that were less surgical in nature; this result was due to the shift from the Health Care Finance Administration classification diagnostic-related group (DRG) system to the Australian Refined DGR system  as well as to improper use of codes. ENT wards in different counties differed in the number of cases  average length of stay  and case mix index. Statistics and case mix clinical data may be a good starting point for informing hospital management to assess ENT service coverage  but they should be supplemented with data on hospitalization costs.
Psychiatry,,,Coercion in psychiatry: the importance of extramural factors. Mechanical restraints and forced procedures in psychiatric wards are of major concern in Denmark and there is a desire to reduce these procedures to a minimum. So far  focus has primarily been on identifying and changing internal (intramural) factors when seeking to reduce coercion. To identify possible external (extramural) factors that may increase the risk of coercion during admission to a closed psychiatric ward. Using a retrospective case-controlled design  235 patients admitted to a closed ward during 2011-2013 were randomly selected. Coercion comprised belt restraint  physical restraint  and forced medication. The data source was the electronic patient records  which include statutory information on all forced measures. Multiple logistic regression analyses were applied to calculate the risk (odds ratio  OR (95% confidence interval)) of forced measures being used. Out of the 235 patients  66 (28%) were subject to coercion. The time of forced procedures was predominately during the first hours after admission. The risk of forced measures being applied was significantly higher if patients were involuntarily admitted (OR = 6.4 (3.4-11.9))  or were acutely intoxicated by substances at the time of admission (OR = 3.7 (1.7-8.2)). Extramural factors should be included when mental health authorities plan efforts to reduce coercion during admission to psychiatric wards. A reduced threshold for admission and improved integrated effort between mental health services and treatment for substance abuse could improve the course of disease for this group of patients and reduce the need for involuntary admissions and subsequently coercion.
Forensic Pathology,Microscopy,,Petechial hemorrhages of the tympanic membrane in attempted suicide by hanging: A case report. It is important to determine whether a person has been strangulated and the diagnosis is not always straightforward since ligature marks are not always present. In forensic medicine the physical examination recommended is careful inspection of the head and neck region  oral cavity  examination of the eyes including the conjunctiva on both the upper and lower eyelids and photo documentation. Petechial hemorrhages of the conjunctiva are considered marker of life threatening hanging or strangulation. Hemorrhage from ears  perforated tympanic membrane and haematotympanum are scarcely described in case reports of strangulated patients. To our knowledge we are the first to report petechial hemorrhages of the tympanic membrane in a patient following attempted suicide by hanging. We believe that the petechial hemorrhages develop from the capillaries located in lamina propria of the epidermal layer above the fibrous layer. This assumption is made on the basis of our assessment of a normal tympanic membrane with light microscopy. Petechial hemorrhages of the tympanic membrane might in fact be the only sign of life threatening pressure applied to the neck. This is a very important finding and prospective studies should be conducted for further clarification on the matter.
Epidemiology,,,Cigarette smoking and the risk of primary Sjögren's syndrome: a nested case control study. Smoking is reported to affect the risk of a number of chronic disorders  including rheumatic diseases. Previous cross-sectional studies have shown a lower frequency of smoking in patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of smoking and socioeconomic status on the risk of subsequent diagnosis of pSS in a nested case-control study. Participants in two large population-based health surveys who were later diagnosed with pSS were identified through linkage with the Malmö Sjögren's Syndrome Register. Matched controls were obtained from the health surveys. Sixty-three patients with pSS with pre-diagnostic data from the health surveys were identified. Current smoking was associated with a significantly lower risk of later being diagnosed with pSS (odds ratio (OR) 0.3; 95% CI 0.1-0.6). Furthermore  former smoking was associated with an increased risk of subsequent pSS diagnosis (OR 4.0; 95% CI 1.8-8.8) compared to never smoking. Similar results were found in a sub-analysis of patients with reported symptom onset after inclusion in the health surveys. Socioeconomic status and levels of formal education had no significant impact on the risk of later being diagnosed with pSS. In this nested case-control study  current smoking was associated with a reduced risk of subsequent diagnosis of pSS. In addition  former smoking was associated with an increased risk. Whether this reflects a biological effect of cigarette smoking or other mechanisms should be further investigated in future studies.
Epidemiology,,,Societal costs and patients' experience of health inequities before and after diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis: a Danish cohort study. To comprehensively study the comorbidities  healthcare and public transfer (allowance) costs in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) before and after diagnosis. Nationwide cohort study  using data from Danish registries from January 1998 through December 2014. A total of 10 525 patients with PsA and 20 777 matched general population comparator (GPC) subjects were included. Societal costs  employment status and occurrence of comorbidities in patients with PsA both before and after diagnosis were compared with GPC subjects. At baseline  patients with PsA had significantly more comorbidities  including cardiovascular disease (OR 1(.)70 95% CI 1(.)55 to 1(.)86)  respiratory diseases (OR 1(.)73 95% CI 1(.)54 to 1(.)96) and infectious diseases (OR 2(.)03 95% CI 1(.)69 to 2(.)42) compared with GPC subjects. At all time points  patients with PsA had higher total healthcare and public transfer costs; they also had lower income (p<0.001) and incurred a net average increased societal cost of €10 641 per patient-year compared with GPC subjects following diagnosis. The relative risk (RR) for being on disability pension 5 years prior to PsA diagnosis was 1(.)36 (95% CI 1(.)24 to 1(.)49) compared with GPC subjects. The RR increased to 1(.)60 (95% CI 1(.)49 to 1(.)72) at the time of diagnosis and was 2(.)69 (95% CI 2(.)40 to 3(.)02) 10 years after diagnosis  where 21(.)8% of the patients with PsA received disability pension. Our findings are suggestive of health inequity for patients with PsA and call for individual preventive measures and societal action.
Nanomedicine,Nanotechnology,,The battle of "nano" paclitaxel. Paclitaxel (PTX) is one of the three most widely used chemotherapeutic agents  together with doxorubicin and cisplatin  and is first or second line treatment for several types of cancers. In 2000  Taxol  the conventional formulation of PTX  became the best-selling cancer drug of all time with annual sales of 1.6 billion. In 2005  the introduction of the albumin-based formulation of PTX  known as Abraxane  ended Taxol's monopoly of the PTX market. Abraxane's ability to push the Taxol innovator and generic formulations aside attracted fierce competition amongst competitors worldwide to develop their own unique  new and improved formulation of PTX. At this time there are at least 18 companies focused on pre-clinical and/or clinical development of nano-formulations of PTX. These pharmaceutical companies are investing substantial capital to capture a share of the lucrative global PTX market. It is hoped that any formulation that dominates the market will result in tangible benefits to patients in terms of both survival and quality of life. Given all of this activity  here we address the question: Who is going to win the battle of "nano" paclitaxel?
Biophysics,Chemistry  Physical,,Arrhenius temperature dependence of in vitro tissue plasminogen activator thrombolysis. Stroke is a devastating disease and a leading cause of death and disability. Currently  the only FDA approved therapy for acute ischemic stroke is the intravenous administration of the thrombolytic medication  recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). However  this treatment has many contraindications and can have dangerous side effects such as intra-cerebral hemorrhage. These treatment limitations have led to much interest in potential adjunctive therapies  such as therapeutic hypothermia (T <or 35 degrees C) and ultrasound enhanced thrombolysis. Such interest may lead to combining these therapies with tPA to treat stroke  however little is known about the effects of temperature on the thrombolytic efficacy of tPA. In this work  we measure the temperature dependence of the fractional clot mass loss Deltam(T) resulting from tPA exposure in an in vitro human clot model. We find that the temperature dependence is well described by an Arrhenius temperature dependence with an effective activation energy E(eff) of 42.0 +/- 0.9 kJ mole(-1). E(eff) approximates the activation energy of the plasminogen-to-plasmin reaction of 48.9 kJ mole(-1). A model to explain this temperature dependence is proposed. These results will be useful in predicting the effects of temperature in future lytic therapies.
Ultrasonics,,,Effect of mild hypothermia on the thrombolytic efficacy of 120 kHz ultrasound enhanced thrombolysis in an in-vitro human clot model. Ischemic stroke causes substantial death and disability. Currently  recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is the only FDA approved therapy. However  there are dangerous side effects and therapy must start within 3 h of onset. Therefore  there is interest in adjunctive therapies such as ultrasound enhanced thrombolysis (UET) and hypothermia. Recently  transcranial ultrasound during rt-PA therapy was shown to improve vessel recanalization. Also hypothermia (32-34 degrees C) was shown to be safe and possibly improve outcome. This suggests combining UET and hypothermia to treat ischemic stroke. Little is known about the effects of hypothermia on UET  and in-vitro rt-PA efficacy is reduced for T<37 degrees C. Here  the effects of hypothermia on UET in in-vitro human clot are presented. It is hypothesized that UET efficacy at 33 degrees C is less than at 37 degrees C. Whole blood was drawn from volunteers. Clots were made  incubated at 37 degrees C and aged for 2 days for maximal lytic resistance. Clots were exposed to human fresh-frozen plasma (control)  hFFP and rt-PA ([rt-PA]=3.2 microg/ml)  hFFP and 120 kHz ultrasound (US)  and hFFP  rt-PA and ultrasound (UET) at 33 degrees C and 37 degrees C. Clot percent mass loss (Deltam) was measured to determine thrombolytic efficacy. Data were analyzed using mixed-model analysis of variance. US and rt-PA independently increased Deltam (3.5+/-1.0% and 5.1+/-0.9% respectively; p<0.01) over control. UET increased Deltam an additional 8.1+/-1.3% (p=0.026) The effect of temperature on Deltam (-1.6+/-0.7%) was not significant (p=0.09). Hypothermia did not reduce UET efficacy in this in-vitro model.
Pediatrics,,,Danish clinical guidelines for examination and treatment of overweight and obese children and adolescents in a pediatric setting. Overweight children are at an increased risk of becoming obese adults  which may lead to shorter life expectancies in the current generation of children as compared to their parents. Furthermore  being an overweight child has a negative psycho-social impact. We consider obesity in children and adolescents a chronic illness  which is in line with the American Medical Society. We summarize the evidence for the efficacy of a combination of diet  physical activity and behavior-focused interventions in a family-based setting. The present guidelines propose a multidisciplinary service implemented as a "chronic care model" based on "best clinical practice" inspired by an American expert committee and the daily practice of The Children's Obesity Clinic at Copenhagen University Hospital Holbaek. Children and adolescents should be referred for examination and treatment in a pediatric setting when BMI corresponds to an isoBMI of minimum 30 or BMI corresponds to an isoBMI of 25 and complex obesity is suspected. Obtaining a thorough medical history is pivotal. We propose a structured interview to ensure collection of all relevant information. We recommend physical examination focused on BMI  waist circumference  growth  pubertal stage  blood pressure  neurology and skin and provide comprehensive paraclinical investigations for obesity and obesity related conditions. Treatment of obesity in children and adolescents is fully dependent on the combined effort of the entire family. This cannot be overemphasized! The main principle of the treatment is developing an individual detailed plan for every patient to reduce caloric intake whilst increasing physical activity  leaving no ambiguity with the recommendations.
Serology,,,Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus in infants study (IRIS) of hospitalized and non-ill infants aged <1 year in four countries: study design and methods. This multi-country prospective study of infants aged <1 year aims to assess the frequency of influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections associated with hospitalizations  to describe clinical features and antibody response to infection  and to examine predictors of very severe disease requiring intensive care. We are enrolling a hospital-based cohort and a sample of non-ill infants in four countries (Albania  Jordan  Nicaragua  and the Philippines) using a common protocol. We are currently starting year 2 of a 2- to 3-year study and will enroll approximately 3 000 infants hospitalized for any acute illness (respiratory or non-respiratory) during periods of local influenza and/or RSV circulation. After informed consent and within 24 h of admission  we collect blood and respiratory specimens and conduct an interview to assess socio-demographic characteristics  medical history  and symptoms of acute illness (onset ≤10 days). Vital signs  interventions  and medications are documented daily through medical record abstraction. A follow-up health assessment and collection of convalescent blood occurs 3-5 weeks after enrollment. Influenza and RSV infection is confirmed by singleplex real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays. Serologic conversion will be assessed comparing acute and convalescent sera using hemagglutination inhibition assay for influenza antibodies and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for RSV. Concurrent with hospital-based enrollment  respiratory specimens are also being collected (and tested by rRT-PCR) from approximately 1 400 non-ill infants aged <1 year during routine medical or preventive care. The Influenza and RSV in Infants Study (IRIS) promises to expand our knowledge of the frequency  clinical features  and antibody profiles of serious influenza and RSV disease among infants aged <1 year  quantify the proportion of infections that may be missed by traditional surveillance  and inform decisions about the potential value of existing and new vaccines and other prevention and treatment strategies.
Psychiatry,,,Increased risk of antidepressant use in childhood cancer survivors: a Danish population-based cohort study. Childhood cancer survivors are at risk of both somatic and mental late effects  but large population-based studies of depression are lacking. Risk of antidepressant use was evaluated in a population-based cohort of 5452 Danish children treated for cancer in 1975-2009 by linkage to the National Prescription Drug Database  which worldwide is the oldest nationwide registry of prescription medication. Hazard ratios (HRs) for antidepressant use were estimated in a Cox proportional hazards model stratified on sex  with population comparisons as referents. Overall  childhood cancer survivors were at increased risk of having antidepressants prescribed (HR  1.4; 95% confidence interval (CI)  1.3-1.5). The excess absolute risk of antidepressant use was 2.5 per 1000 person-years (95% CI  1.7-3.3)  equivalent to an excess of 2.5 survivors for every 100 survivors followed for 10years. Increased HRs of 30-50% were seen for survivors of cancers of all main groups (haematological malignancies  central nervous system (CNS) and solid tumors); the highest risk was among children treated with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HR  1.9; 95% CI  1.2-3.1). Our data suggested that the risk was most pronounced for children treated in the most recent calendar periods (test for interaction between cancer and calendar periods: P<0.001)  especially for survivors of haematological cancers (P=0.007). Interaction analysis of the effect of parental socioeconomic position and psychiatric disease on the association between childhood cancer and antidepressant use indicated no modifying effect. Childhood cancer survivors should be followed-up for depression. Our results indicate an increasing need for follow-up especially in survivors treated by more recent  intensive anticancer treatment.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Expression pattern of clinically relevant markers in paediatric germ cell- and sex-cord stromal tumours is similar to adult testicular tumours. Paediatric germ cell tumours (GCTs) are rare and account for less than 3 % of childhood cancers. Like adult GCTs  they probably originate from primordial germ cells  but the pattern of histopathological types is different  and they occur predominantly in extragonadal sites along the body midline. Because they are rare  histology of paediatric GCTs is poorly documented  and it remains unclear to what extent they differ from adult GCTs. We have analysed 35 paediatric germ cell tumours and 5 gonadal sex-cord stromal tumours from prepubertal patients aged 0-15 years  to gain further knowledge  elaborate on clinical-pathological associations and better understand their developmental divergence. The tumours were screened for expression of stemness-related factors (OCT4  AP-2γ  SOX2)  classical yolk sac tumours (YSTs; AFP  SALL4)  GCTs (HCG  PLAP  PDPN/D2-40)  as well as markers for sex-cord stromal tumour (PDPN  GATA4). All YSTs expressed AFP and SALL4  with GATA4 present in 13/14. The majority of teratomas expressed SOX2 and PDPN  whereas SALL4 was found in 8/13 immature teratomas. Adult seminoma markers AP-2γ  OCT4  SALL4 and PDPN were all expressed in dysgerminoma. We further report a previously unrecognised pathogenetic relationship between AFP and SALL4 in YST in that different populations of YST cells express either SALL4 or AFP  which suggests variable differentiation status. We also show that AP-2γ is expressed in the granulosa layer of ovarian follicles and weakly expressed in immature but not in mature granulosa cell tumours. Our findings indicate that the expression pattern of these antigens is similar between paediatric and adult GCTs  even though they develop along different developmental trajectories.
Internal Medicine,,,[Selected acute admission to a medical department]. The aim of the study was to describe the pattern of admissions to a medical department and to analyse whether acute admissions can be referred to hospitals with limited access to acute medical and surgical assistance and limited access to intensive care. All acute admissions to the medical department during a three-week period were registered. The medical officer in charge of the distribution of patients filled in a questionnaire at the time of telephone contact with the referring physician concerning the feasibility of referral to a medical department with limited access to acute assistance. Out of 113 patients judged suitable for referral to a hospital with limited access to acute assistance  60% had or developed conditions judged to require hospitals with a specialised level of acute services. Contact with a medical officer by telephone seems to be an unsuitable way of selecting which patients do not need highly specialized medical assistance  surgical assistance or intensive care.
Psychophysiology,Research Design,,Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for multiple chemical sensitivity: a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial. Multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) is a condition characterized by recurrent  self-reported symptoms from multiple organ systems  attributable to exposure to a wide range of chemically unrelated substances at low levels. The pathophysiology is unknown  and affected individuals generally favor avoidance of the symptom triggering substances as a coping strategy. The impact of MCS on daily life may thus be severe. An intervention that may effectively reduce the impact of MCS  alleviate the symptoms and the psychological distress associated with the condition is therefore highly needed. In this study we will assess the effects of a mindfulness-based cognitive (MBCT) program on MCS. Using a randomized controlled design (RCT)  we will compare MBCT with treatment as usual (TAU). The MBCT intervention will include 8 weekly 2.5 hour sessions  and 45 minutes of mindfulness home practice 6 days each week. Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires at baseline  post-treatment  and at 6 and 12 months' follow-up. Based on sample size estimation  82 participants will be randomized to either the MBCT intervention or to TAU. The primary outcome will be a measure of the impact of MCS on the participants' lives. The secondary outcome measures are physical symptoms of psychological distress  perceived stress  illness perceptions  QOL  and work ability. Lastly  we will assess whether any effect of MBCT on the primary effect measure is mediated by level of mindfulness  self-compassion  perceived stress  and rumination. This trial will provide important information on the effects of MBCT on MCS. Clinical trials identifier NCT01240395.
Research Design,,,Rationale  design and methodology of a double-blind  randomized  placebo-controlled study of escitalopram in prevention of Depression in Acute Coronary Syndrome (DECARD). The prevalence of depression in patients with acute coronary syndrome  i.e. myocardial infarction and unstable angina  is higher than in the general population. The prevalence of anxiety is higher as well. Both depression and anxiety are associated with poor cardiac outcomes and higher mortality. Comorbid depression in patients with acute coronary syndrome often goes undiagnosed  and it is therefore a challenging task to prevent this risk factor. The study of DEpression in Coronary ARtery Disease (DECARD) is designed to examine if it is possible to prevent depression in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Two hundred forty non-depressed patients with acute coronary syndrome are randomized to treatment with either escitalopram or placebo for 1 year. Psychiatric and cardiac assessment of patients is performed to evaluate the possibility of preventing depression. Diagnosis of depression and Hamilton Depression Scale are the primary outcome measures. This is the first study of prevention of depression in patients after acute coronary syndrome with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov. Identifier: NCT00140257.
Research Design,,,Supervised progressive cross-continuum strength training compared with usual care in older medical patients: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial (the STAND-Cph trial). Hospitalization in older adults is characterized by physical inactivity and a risk of losing function and independence. Systematic strength training can improve muscle strength and functional performance in older adults. Few studies have examined the effect of a program initiated during hospitalization and continued after discharge. We conducted a feasibility study prior to this trial and found a progression model for loaded sit-to-stands feasible in older medical patients. This study aims to determine whether a simple supervised strength training program for the lower extremities (based on the model)  combined with post-training protein supplementation initiated during hospitalization and continued at home for 4 weeks  is superior to usual care on change in mobility 4 weeks after discharge in older medical patients. Eighty older medical patients (65 years or older) acutely admitted from their own homes will be included in this randomized  controlled  parallel-group  investigator-blinded  superiority trial. After baseline assessments patients will be randomized to (1) intervention: progressive strength training during hospitalization and after discharge (home-based)  or (2) control: usual care. Shortly after discharge  4 weeks after discharge (primary end point) and 6 months after discharge patients will be assessed in their own homes. The intervention encompasses strength training consisting of two lower extremity exercises (sit-to-stand and heel raise) daily during hospitalization and three times per week for 4 weeks after discharge. Both exercises follow pre-defined models for progression and will be performed for three sets of 8-12 repetitions maximum in each training session. Thereafter  the patient will be asked to consume a protein supplement given orally containing 18 g milk-based protein. The primary outcome will be change in the de Morton Mobility Index score from baseline to 4 weeks after discharge. Secondary outcomes will be 24-h mobility level  isometric knee extension strength  the 30-sec sit-to-stand test  habitual gait speed  hand-grip strength  and Activities of Daily Living. We chose to investigate the effect of a minimal time-consuming treatment approach  i.e. two well-performed strength training exercises combined with protein supplementation  to facilitate implementation in a busy clinical care setting  given a positive trial outcome. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01964482 .
General Practice,,,Prevalence of sexual desire and satisfaction among patients with screen-detected diabetes and impact of intensive multifactorial treatment: results from the ADDITION-Denmark study. Sexual problems are common in people with diabetes. It is unknown whether early detection of diabetes and subsequent intensive multifactorial treatment (IT) are associated with sexual health. We report the prevalence of low sexual desire and low sexual satisfaction among people with screen-detected diabetes and compare the impact of intensive multifactorial treatment with the impact of routine care (RC) on these measures. A cross-sectional analysis of the ADDITION-Denmark trial cohort six years post-diagnosis. 190 general practices around Denmark. A total of 968 patients with screen-detected type 2 diabetes. Low sexual desire and low sexual satisfaction. Mean (standard deviation  SD) age was 64.9 (6.9) years. The prevalence of low sexual desire was 53% (RC) and 54% (IT) among women  and 24% (RC) and 25% (IT) among men. The prevalence of low sexual satisfaction was 23% (RC) and 18% (IT) among women  and 27% (RC) and 37% (IT) among men. Among men  the prevalence of low sexual satisfaction was significantly higher in the IT group than in the RC group  p = 0.01. Low sexual desire and low satisfaction are frequent among men and women with screen-detected diabetes  and IT may negatively impact men's sexual satisfaction.
Genetics  Microbial,Molecular Biology,,Optimization of ordered plasmid assembly by gap repair in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Combinatorial genetic libraries are powerful tools for diversifying and optimizing biomolecules. The process of library assembly is a major limiting factor for library complexity and quality. Gap repair by homologous recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae can facilitate in vivo assembly of DNA fragments sharing short patches of sequence homology  thereby supporting generation of high-complexity libraries without compromising fidelity. In this study  we have optimized the ordered assembly of three DNA fragments into a gapped vector by in vivo homologous recombination. Assembly is achieved by co-transformation of the DNA fragments and the gapped vector  using a modified lithium acetate protocol. The optimal gap-repair efficiency is found at a 1:80 molar ratio of gapped vector to each of the three fragments. We measured gap-repair efficiency in different genetic backgrounds and observed increased efficiency in mutants carrying a deletion of the SGS1 helicase-encoding gene. Using our experimental conditions  a gap-repair efficiency of > 10(6) plasmid-harbouring colonies/µg gapped vector DNA is obtained in a single transformation  with a recombination fidelity > 90%.
Research Design,,,Transfusion requirements in septic shock (TRISS) trial - comparing the effects and safety of liberal versus restrictive red blood cell transfusion in septic shock patients in the ICU: protocol for a randomised controlled trial. Transfusion of red blood cells (RBC) is recommended in septic shock and the majority of these patients receive RBC transfusion in the intensive care unit (ICU). However  benefit and harm of RBCs have not been established in this group of high-risk patients. The Transfusion Requirements in Septic Shock (TRISS) trial is a multicenter trial with assessor-blinded outcome assessment  randomising 1 000 patients with septic shock in 30 Scandinavian ICUs to receive transfusion with pre-storage leuko-depleted RBC suspended in saline-adenine-glucose and mannitol (SAGM) at haemoglobin level (Hb) of 7 g/dl or 9 g/dl  stratified by the presence of haematological malignancy and centre. The primary outcome measure is 90-day mortality. Secondary outcome measures are organ failure  ischaemic events  severe adverse reactions (SARs: anaphylactic reaction  acute haemolytic reaction and transfusion-related circulatory overload  and acute lung injury) and mortality at 28 days  6 months and 1 year.The sample size will enable us to detect a 9% absolute difference in 90-day mortality assuming a 45% event rate with a type 1 error rate of 5% and power of 80%. An interim analysis will be performed after 500 patients  and the Data Monitoring and Safety Committee will recommend the trial be stopped if a group difference in 90-day mortality with P ≤0.001 is present at this point. The TRISS trial may bridge the gap between clinical practice and the lack of efficacy and safety data on RBC transfusion in septic shock patients. The effect of restrictive versus liberal RBC transfusion strategy on mortality  organ failure  ischaemic events and SARs will be evaluated.
Research Design,,,Comparing the effect of hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 with balanced crystalloid solution on mortality and kidney failure in patients with severe sepsis (6S--Scandinavian Starch for Severe Sepsis/Septic Shock trial): study protocol  design and rationale for a double-blinded  randomised clinical trial. By tradition colloid solutions have been used to obtain fast circulatory stabilisation in shock  but high molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch (HES) may cause acute kidney failure in patients with severe sepsis. Now lower molecular weight HES 130/0.4 is the preferred colloid in Scandinavian intensive care units (ICUs) and 1st choice fluid for patients with severe sepsis. However  HES 130/0.4 is largely unstudied in patients with severe sepsis. The 6S trial will randomize 800 patients with severe sepsis in 30 Scandinavian ICUs to masked fluid resuscitation using either 6% HES 130/0.4 in Ringer's acetate or Ringer's acetate alone. The composite endpoint of 90-day mortality or end-stage kidney failure is the primary outcome measure. The secondary outcome measures are severe bleeding or allergic reactions  organ failure  acute kidney failure  days alive without renal replacement therapy or ventilator support and 28-day and 1/2- and one-year mortality. The sample size will allow the detection of a 10% absolute difference between the two groups in the composite endpoint with a power of 80%. The 6S trial will provide important safety and efficacy data on the use of HES 130/0.4 in patients with severe sepsis. The effects on mortality  dialysis-dependency  time on ventilator  bleeding and markers of resuscitation  metabolism  kidney failure  and coagulation will be assessed. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00962156.
Internal Medicine,,,Repeated measurements of generic indicators: a Danish national program to benchmark and improve quality of care. To measure performance on the basis of generic (non-diagnoses related) standards of care developed in a national Danish quality improvement programme in departments of internal medicine  and to determine the power of repetitive national audits to increase levels of performance. Multifaceted intervention: national audits in 2001 and 2002 based on the standards of the program  combined with direct contact with heads of departments and a national conference to discuss audit results. Seventy-nine and 82 wards in 2001 and 2002  respectively  covering 71% of Danish hospitals receiving medical emergencies. The wards participated on a voluntary basis. In the first audit round  3950 patients were admitted as emergencies  while 4068 patients were admitted as emergencies in the second audit. Patients were included without reference to diagnoses. Correct initial diagnostic assessment  early interdisciplinary action plans  correct drug prescriptions  waiting times for examinations  documented patient information  readmissions  and content and processing time for discharge letters. For the 70 wards participating in both rounds  the general level of performance improved significantly between the two audits: the proportion of patients with correct initial diagnostic assessment increased from 75.9% to 79.4%  the proportion of patients with correct drug prescriptions increased from 83.8% to 85.9%  and the proportion of sufficiently informed patients increased from 32.4% to 36.2% (P < 0.05). The proportion of medical records containing action plans for selected clinical problems (nutritional and functional problems  fever  and treatment of pain) increased from 72.8% to 75.9% (P < 0.05). Length of stay in hospital was significantly related to a correct initial assessment and to waiting time for examinations. Wards with a common medication chart for physicians and nurses had significantly more correct drug prescriptions than wards that did not use a medication chart. Fifty-four (75%) of the participating departments indicated that the result of the first audit round had led to organizational changes in the department. Professional self-regulation guided by a multidisciplinary audit tool developed in cooperation with professionals can improve quality of care. It is possible to conduct and repeat a national audit on a voluntary basis.
Internal Medicine,,,[The Good Medical Department. Results from a national survey of quality in 1998]. This cross-sectional study describes quality related data from 39 medical wards in Denmark. The study is based on a review of 1517 medical records and a short patient interview. The medical departments took part voluntarily in the study  which was initiated by the Danish Society for Internal Medicine. A total of 23 quality-related indicators related to the planning of the treatment  documentation in patient records  and care were registered. The day before the data collection was an inactive inpatient day for 22.8 +/- 1.1% of patients. Allergy was insufficiently documented in the medical record for 18.8 +/- 1.0% of patients. Weight was not documented in 48.8 +/- 1.3% of patients. Considerations about anticoagulation treatment of atrial fibrillation were not documented in 50.1 +/- 3.6% of patients with atrial fibrillation. This study indicates that it is possible on a voluntary basis to collect and distribute quality-related data. The survey has recently been repeated with a modified data registration sheet.
Stroke Rehabilitation,,,Rehabilitation of the hemiparetic gait by nociceptive withdrawal reflex-based functional electrical therapy: a randomized  single-blinded study. Gait deficits are very common after stroke and improved therapeutic interventions are needed. The objective of this study was therefore to investigate the therapeutic use of the nociceptive withdrawal reflex to support gait training in the subacute post-stroke phase. Individuals were randomly allocated to a treatment group that received physiotherapy-based gait training supported by withdrawal reflex stimulation and a control group that received physiotherapy-based gait training alone. Electrical stimuli delivered to the arch of the foot elicited the withdrawal reflex at heel-off with the purpose of facilitating the initiation and execution of the swing phase. Gait was assessed before and immediately after finishing treatment  and one month and six months after finishing treatment. Assessments included the Functional Ambulation Category (FAC) test  the preferred and maximum gait velocities  the duration of the stance phase in the hemiparetic side  the duration of the gait cycle  and the stance time symmetry ratio. The treatment group showed an improved post treatment preferred walking velocity (p < 0.001) and fast walking velocity (p < 0.001) compared to the control group. Furthermore  subjects in the treatment group with severe walking impairment at inclusion time showed the best improvement as assessed by a longer duration of the stance phase in the hemiparetic side (p < 0.002) and a shorter duration of the gait cycle (p < 0.002). The stance time symmetry ratio was significantly better for the treatment than the control group after finishing training (p < 0.02). No differences between groups were detected with the FAC test after finishing training (p = 0.09). Withdrawal reflex-based functional electrical therapy was useful in the rehabilitation of the hemiparetic gait of severely impaired patients.
Research Design,,,Effect of adding gefitinib to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in estrogen receptor negative early breast cancer in a randomized phase II trial. Gefitinib  an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor  has shown both anti-proliferative and anti-tumoral activity in breast cancer. This study was designed to determine the effect of adding gefitinib to neoadjuvant epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (EC) on tumor response rates. Women with unilateral  primary operable  estrogen receptor negative invasive breast cancer ≥ 2 cm were eligible for inclusion. Randomized patients were to receive four cycles of neoadjuvant EC plus 12 weeks of either gefitinib (250 mg daily) or placebo. Primary endpoint was pathologic complete response (pCR)  and secondary endpoints were complete response (CR) and overall objective response (OR). 181 patients were randomized. A pCR was observed in 17% (12/71) of patients treated with gefitinib and in 12% (9/73) of patients treated with placebo (4.57% difference  95% CI -7.19 to 6.33; P = 0.44). CR was observed in 10% of patients in both the gefitinib (7/71) and the placebo group (7/73) (0.27% difference  95% CI -9.6 to 10.2; P = 0.96). There was no significant difference in OR (5.96%; 95% CI -9.9 to 21.9; P = 0.45) between the two groups. Post hoc subgroup analysis showed a significant difference in pCR between triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and non-TNBC tumors (P = 0.03). More patients in the gefitinib arm had hematological toxicity (P = 0.15) and discontinued treatment (9/94 vs. 2/86) because of adverse events (AE). Tumor response rates were similar in the two groups. A significantly higher pCR rate was observed post hoc in TNBC versus non-TNBC independent of treatment. More patients in the gefitinib group discontinued treatment because of AE.
Epidemiology,Reproductive Medicine,,In utero exposure to alcohol and puberty in boys: a pregnancy cohort study. Epidemiological studies have raised concerns about the reproductive consequences of in utero exposure to alcohol. Maternal lifestyle factors have been associated with altered pubertal development  but the impact of prenatal alcohol exposure on male puberty is unknown. Thus  the objective was to explore whether prenatal alcohol exposure alters pubertal development in boys. Follow-up of a Danish pregnancy cohort. Sons (N=2522) of women who were enrolled in a Danish pregnancy cohort between 1984 and 1987. Indicators of pubertal development  assessed by age at first nocturnal emission  voice break  acne and regular shaving. We found a tendency towards a later age at first nocturnal emission and voice break following in utero exposure to binge drinking. Boys exposed to ≥5 binge drinking episodes during pregnancy experienced their first nocturnal emission 7.3 months (95% CI -2.8 to 17.4) later and voice break 4.9 months (95% CI -0.6 to 10.4) later than the unexposed boys. Results for average weekly alcohol consumption were in the same direction  but differences were smaller and not statistically significant. We found no strong support for the hypothesis that in utero exposure to weekly alcohol consumption is a risk factor for altered pubertal development  but a tendency towards delayed pubertal development among boys exposed to binge drinking during fetal life was observed. Longitudinal studies  with data collected as children go through puberty  are needed to explore this further.
Geriatric Nursing,,,Differences between day and nonday workers in exposure to physical and psychosocial work factors in the Danish eldercare sector. The possible interaction between individual and occupational risk factors  the need for meaningful intervention  and the demand for valid shift work research make the accumulation of adverse exposures at certain times of the day of special relevance with respect to occupational health. The aim of the present study was therefore to examine whether there was a clustering of detrimental work factors among female eldercare workers in fixed evening or fixed night shifts when they are compared with workers in fixed day shifts. This cross-sectional  questionnaire-based study was conducted among 4590 female health care workers in the Danish eldercare sector. The participants worked in nursing homes  in home care  or in both. They answered questions on job demands  job control  and social support  together with questions on physical and psychological violence  physical workload  and passive smoking. We found that-compared with day workers-fixed nonday workers were more exposed to low job control  low support from leaders  physical and psychological violence  and high physical demands. Nonday workers were  however  less exposed to high demands. These differences remained after control for age  job title  and workplace. Exposures in the work environment of Danish eldercare workers varied between shifts. In a research perspective these findings stress the importance of adequate adjustment for work factors when the health effects of shift work are studied. Moreover  the results underscore the need for an increased awareness of work factors of special importance among nonday workers when interventions against shiftwork-related occupational disorders are designed.
Genetics,,,Familial idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus. Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a late-onset surgically alleviated  progressive disease. We characterize a potential familial subgroup of iNPH in a nation-wide Finnish cohort of 375 shunt-operated iNPH-patients. The patients were questionnaired and phone-interviewed  whether they have relatives with either diagnosed iNPH or disease-related symptomatology. Then pedigrees of all families with more than one iNPH-case were drawn. Eighteen patients (4.8%) from 12 separate pedigrees had at least one shunt-operated relative whereas 42 patients (11%) had relatives with two or more triad symptoms. According to multivariate logistic regression analysis  familial iNPH-patients had up to 3-fold risk of clinical dementia compared to sporadic iNPH patients. This risk was independent from diagnosed Alzheimer's disease and APOE ε4 genotype. This study describes a familial entity of iNPH offering a novel approach to discover the potential genetic characteristics of iNPH. Discovered pedigrees offer an intriguing opportunity to conduct longitudinal studies targeting potential preclinical signs of iNPH.
Immunohistochemistry,,,The Expression of Transthyretin and Amyloid-β Protein Precursor is Altered in the Brain of Idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus Patients. Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a dementing condition in which Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques are frequently observed in the neocortex. iNPH patients with prominent Aβ pathology show AD-related alterations in amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) processing resulting from increased γ-secretase activity. Our goal was to assess potential alterations in the global gene expression profile in the brain of iNPH patients as compared to non-demented controls and to evaluate the levels of the identified targets in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of iNPH patients. The genome-wide expression profile of ~35 000 probes was assessed in the RNA samples obtained from 22 iNPH patients and eight non-demented control subjects using a microarray chip. The soluble levels of sAβPPα  sAβPPβ  and transthyretin (TTR) were measured from the CSF of 102 iNPH patients using ELISA. After correcting the results for multiple testing  significant differences in the expression of TTR and A βPP were observed between iNPH and control subjects. The mRNA levels of TTR were on average 17-fold lower in iNPH samples compared to control samples. Conversely  the expression level of A βPP was on average three times higher in iNPH samples as compared to control samples. Interestingly  the expression of α-secretase (ADAM10) was also increased in iNPH patients. In the lumbar CSF samples  soluble TTR levels showed a significant positive correlation with sAβPPα and sAβPPβ  but TTR levels did not predict the brain pathology or the shunt response. These findings suggest differences in the expression profile of key factors involved in AD-related cellular events in the brain of iNPH patients.
Immunohistochemistry,,,COX-2 is associated with proliferation and apoptosis markers and serves as an independent prognostic factor in gastric cancer. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an important factor in gastric carcinogenesis  and COX-2 expression in gastric cancer patients correlates with prognosis. We have now studied the impact of COX-2 in comparison to six other tissue tumor markers  DNA index  and S-phase fraction (SPF) in a large series of gastric cancer specimens. From 342 consecutive patients  337 archival tissue specimens were available for immunohistochemistry of COX-2  HuR  cyclin A  MMP-2  p53  p21  and Ki-67 and 313 for analysis of DNA index and S-phase fraction by flow cytometry. Associations between factors were assessed by chi-square test and survival analysis by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox model. A significant association emerged between of COX-2 and p53 (p < 0.0001)  Ki-67 (p = 0.013)  DNA ploidy (p < 0.0001)  and SPF (p < 0.0001). In an extended multivariate analysis  COX-2 and p53 expression were independent prognostic factors for poor survival  in addition to high stage and non-curative surgery. In gastric cancer  COX-2 expression associated with markers for apoptosis and proliferation  and furthermore  it was confirmed that COX-2 and p53 are strong prognostic indicators.
Immunohistochemistry,,,MYC-dependent regulation and prognostic role of CIP2A in gastric cancer. Cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) is a recently identified human oncoprotein that stabilizes the c-Myc (MYC) protein. However  the clinical relevance of CIP2A to human cancers had not been demonstrated  but the mechanism of its regulation and its clinical role in cancer were completely unknown. Tissue microarrays consisting of 223 gastric adenocarcinoma specimens were evaluated for the presence of CIP2A using immunohistochemistry  and the association of CIP2A expression with survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. The effects of MYC and CIP2A on each other's expression and on cell proliferation were investigated in several gastric cancer cell lines using small interfering RNAs to CIP2A and MYC and immunoblotting. To further evaluate the role of MYC in CIP2A regulation  an inhibitor of MYC dimerization  10058-F4  and an inducible MycER model were used. Expression of CIP2A protein was associated with reduced overall survival for gastric cancer patients with tumors 5 cm or smaller  with a 10-year overall survival in the CIP2A-immunopositive group of 8.1% as compared with 37.6% in the CIP2A-negative group (difference = 29.5%  95% confidence interval = 12.5% to 46.5%  P = .001). In gastric cancer cell lines  CIP2A depletion led to decreased proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of the cells  as well as to reduced stability and expression of MYC protein. Interestingly  MYC depletion led to reduced expression of CIP2A mRNA and protein. Moreover  experiments with an MYC inhibitor and activator suggested that MYC directly promotes CIP2A gene expression. Finally  CIP2A and MYC immunopositivities were associated in gastric cancer specimens (P = .021). CIP2A immunopositivity is a predictor of survival for some subgroups of gastric cancer patients. CIP2A and MYC appear to be regulated in a positive feedback loop  wherein they promote each other's expression and gastric cancer cell proliferation.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Comparison of the prognostic value of a panel of tissue tumor markers and established clinicopathological factors in patients with gastric cancer. The purpose of this study was to assess if the addition of a panel of tumor markers to established clinicopathological factors could improve the accuracy of 5-year outcome prediction in gastric cancer. The studied markers were chosen to represent different aspects of tumor biology. The expression of syndecan-1  tenascin-C  tumor-associated trypsin inhibitor (TATI)  p53  p21 and bcl-2 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry informalin-fixed  paraffin-embedded specimens from 337 patients with gastric cancer. In addition  the DNA ploidy and S-phase fraction (SPF) were assessed by flow cytometry. The loss of epithelial syndecan-1  strong stromal syndecan-1  the loss of stromal tenascin-C  the loss of tumor tissue TATI  high p53 and high p21 expression  aneuploidy and high (> or =7.6%) SPF were all associated with an unfavorable prognosis in univariate survival analysis. In multivariate survival analysis  p53 (hazard ratio (HR) 1.58; confidence interval (CI) 95% 1.16-2.16)  p21 (HR 1.67; CI 95% 1.09-2.56) and DNA ploidy (HR 1.50; CI 95% 1.10-2.05) were independent prognostic factors  in addition to penetration depth (pT)  lymph node status (pN)  age at diagnosis and estimated radicality of surgery. The difference in prognostic accuracy between a base model with pT  pN  age and radicality of surgery (area under the curve (AUC) 0.898; CI 95% 0.86-0.94) and an extended model including p53  p21 and DNA ploidy (AUC 0.900; CI 95% 0.86-0.94) was not statistically significant (p=0.85). In gastric cancer  p53 and p21 expression  as well as DNA ploidy  are independent prognostic factors in addition to standard clinicopathological factors. However  the established indicators of the extent of disease show an impressively high accuracy in 5-year outcome prediction and adding the examined tumor markers to the base model does not significantly improve the prognostic accuracy.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Prognostic significance of cyclin A in gastric cancer. High level of cyclin A promotes carcinogenesis  and overexpression of cyclin A has been associated with poor prognosis of cancer patients. We validated the prognostic role of cyclin A in gastric cancer and evaluated its correlation with expression of an mRNA stability factor HuR. From 342 consecutive histologically confirmed gastric cancer patients were obtained 325 representative tissue specimens for cyclin A and 316 for HuR immunohistochemistry. Specimens were stained by cyclin A and HuR specific monoclonal antibodies. Nuclear immunostaining detected in > or =5% of the tumor cells was considered the cut-off for cyclin A positivity. Positive HuR immunoreactivity was scored as nuclear or cytoplasmic. Associations between scores  clinicopathological factors and survival were calculated by the chi2-test  Fisher's exact test  Kaplan-Meier test and Cox model. Cyclin A detected in the nuclei of cancer cells was positive in 55% (179 of 325) of the specimens; 40% (127 of 316) of the specimens had cytoplasmic and 88% (279 of 316) nuclear immunoreactivity of HuR. Cyclin A expression was an independent prognostic factor for poor survival. Cyclin A immunoreactivity was associated with old age  high stage  proximal location of the tumor  intestinal type  noncurative resection  advanced penetration depth and with nodal metastases but not distant metastases. Furthermore  cyclin A expression was associated with cytoplasmic HuR expression  whereas no association with nuclear HuR was evident. Cyclin A is an independent prognostic factor in gastric cancer  and one mechanism for its overexpression may depend on cytoplasmic localization of HuR.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Cyclooxygenase-2 is an independent prognostic factor in gastric cancer and its expression is regulated by the messenger RNA stability factor HuR. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) promotes carcinogenesis and its expression associates with clinicopathologic characteristics in gastric cancer. HuR is an mRNA binding protein that controls the stability of certain transcripts including COX-2. We evaluated the prognostic significance of COX-2 and HuR expressions in gastric cancer and whether there exists a link between HuR and COX-2 expressions. The study included 342 consecutive patients with histologically confirmed gastric adenocarcinoma  of whom 321 patients had tissue specimens available for COX-2 and 316 for HuR immunohistochemistry. Specimens were stained by COX-2- and HuR-specific monoclonal antibodies and scored by two independent observers. Correlation to clinical data and survival was assessed. TMK-1 gastric adenocarcinoma cells were treated with small interfering RNA against HuR and expressions of HuR and COX-2 were detected by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. Patients with low COX-2 expression had a cumulative 5-year survival of 53% and those with high COX-2 expression had 16% (P < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis  COX-2 was an independent prognostic factor (P = 0.003). Cytoplasmic HuR expression was associated with high COX-2 expression (P < 0.0001) and with reduced survival (P = 0.004) whereas nuclear positivity for HuR was not. When TMK-1 cells were treated with HuR small interfering RNA  expressions of HuR and COX-2 were reduced. High COX-2 is an independent prognostic factor in gastric cancer. Cytoplasmic expression of HuR associates with high COX-2 expression and with reduced survival  and tissue culture experiments show that HuR can regulate expression of COX-2 in gastric cancer cells.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Tenascin-C expression correlates with prognosis in gastric cancer. Tenascin-C is a hexameric extracellular matrix glycoprotein that is expressed during embryonic development and re-expressed in proliferative processes such as wound healing and tumorigenesis. Stromal tenascin-C may block tumor invasion and thus have a significant influence on tumor spread and prognosis. In the present study  tissue expression of stromal tenascin-C was studied by immunohistochemistry in a series of 314 patients with gastric cancer. Strong tenascin-C positivity was seen in the stroma of the tumor in 122 (39%) cases. There was a correlation between strong tenascin-C expression and low stage (p = 0.002)  superficial tumor penetration (p = 0.02)  location of tumor at the distal third of the stomach (p = 0.03)  and potentially curative surgery (p = 0.008). No significant correlation was found between tenascin-C positivity and nodal status  distant metastases  age  Laurén classification  gender  tumor size  or Borrmann classification. The cumulative 5-year survival in patients with strong tenascin-C expression was 42% compared to 26% in those with negative-to-moderate expression (p = 0.0053). In multivariate survival analysis stratified for estimated cure of surgery  stage of disease was the only independent prognostic factor. In conclusion  tenascin-C expression seems to correlate with cancer related survival in patients with gastric cancer  but may not add significant prognostic information to that provided by TNM stage.
Patient Education as Topic,,,Impact of an ABCDE team triage process combined with public guidance on the division of work in an emergency department. To study the effects of applying an emergency department (ED) triage system  combined with extensive publicity in local media about the "right" use of emergency services  on the division of work between ED nurses and general practitioners (GPs). An observational and quasi-experimental study based on before-after comparisons. Implementation of the ABCDE triage system in a Finnish combined ED where secondary care is adjacent  and in a traditional primary care ED where secondary care is located elsewhere. GPs and nurses from two different primary care EDs. Numbers of monthly visits to different professional groups before and after intervention in the studied primary care EDs and numbers of monthly visits to doctors in the local secondary care ED. The beginning of the triage process increased temporarily the number of independent consultations and patient record entries by ED nurses in both types of studied primary care EDs and reduced the number of patient visits to a doctor compared with previous years but had no effect on doctor visits in the adjacent secondary care ED. No further decrease in the number of nurse or GP visits was observed by inhibiting the entrance of non-urgent patients. The ABCDE triage system combined with public guidance may reduce non-urgent patient visits to doctors in different kinds of primary care EDs without increasing visits in the secondary care ED. However  the additional work to implement the ABCDE system is mainly directed to nurses  which may pose a challenge for staffing.
Health Education,,,Use of email in communication between the Finnish primary healthcare system and general practitioners. The volume of emails is rising rapidly everywhere. However  there is no data available concerning how primary healthcare physicians feel about the use of email communication between themselves  with their managers and with other people contacting them. The objective of this study was to find out what the attitudes of primary care physicians are towards email at work. The use of email was studied among a convenience sample of primary healthcare physicians. Physicians thought that email was a good instrument for delivering information but not as an instrument for leadership. Physicians in lead positions thought more often than ordinary general practitioners (GPs) that email is good for information. The leaders used email more actively than other GPs. The contents of the emails received by the GPs differed depending on the site of work. The total number of emails was higher in urban areas than in rural areas. Emails relating to administration  educational information and meeting materials were more often sent in rural than in urban primary healthcare settings. Information about daily work arrangements and about social events were more frequently emailed in urban than in rural surroundings. Email was considered important for information inside the system but a somewhat difficult tool for discussing complicated subjects. Generally  it was agreed that there was some unimportant information filtering through this medium to the target GPs. GPs were uncertain whether important data reached everybody who needed it or not. Still  almost everybody used the email system regularly and the use of it was considered relatively easy. GPs were generally prone to adopt advice and instructions given via email and implemented those in their working routines. The use of the email system was related to technical ability to use the system. The easier the GP thought that the email system was the more he used it. Rural GPs were more critical in applying advice shared via email than their counterparts in urban areas. In general  physicians thought that email was a good method for reaching many people at the same time. However  the main points of the messages may be missed and the whole email may sometimes not be read. Especially during periods of change in the workplace  it is very important that management is conducted personally. Care must be taken so that disinformation does not spoil the informative value of email in the administration of primary health care. The needed technical assistance should be given to everyone in order to get the best advantage from the use of the email system.
Computer User Training,Education  Nursing  Continuing,Needs Assessment,Data warehouse approach to nursing management. This article describes a data warehouse approach when designing an information system to meet nursing management needs in acute hospital setting. The rapidly changing health care environment has created new challenges for nursing leaders and requires appropriate  accurate and timely data for decision-making. Key aspects of current information needs were identified by a nursing expert group. A data warehouse-based Nursing Management Information System was produced and piloted in nine wards. A survey and interviews were conducted to evaluate the piloting. Data from the patient administrative system together with nursing rostering data and measures for nursing care intensity brought new opportunities for nursing management. A Nursing Management Information System is suggested to be built using data warehouse model. Successful implementation of a Nursing Management Information System requires systematic data quality checks. An information analyst is essential for interpreting and communicating nursing data to multi-professional management groups.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Human beta-defensin-3 producing cells in septic implant loosening. Human β-defensin-3 (hBD-3) has been found in synovial fluid and later in periprosthetic tissues in septic joint implant loosening. The aim of the present study was to identify its cellular sources. Tissue samples from 12 patients were analyzed. A fully automatic Leica BOND MAX staining robot was used. Affinity-purified rabbit anti-human hBD-3 IgG was applied in a two-layer horse radish peroxidase/anti-rabbit-labeled polymer method. Double immunofluorescence of hBD3 together with CD68  CD31  heat shock protein 47 (HSP47) and mast cell tryptase (MCT) staining was done. Human BD-3 was found in monocyte/macrophage-like cells  vascular endothelial cells and fibroblasts-like cells  but was weakly expressed in foreign body giant cells and negative in neutrophils. Human BD-3 was found in CD68 and CD31 immunoreactive cells  whereas HSP47 and MCT positive cells were hBD-3 negative. Immunostaining of hBD-3 was strong in some tissue areas but weak or absent in others. Monocyte/macrophages and endothelial cells were established in this study as the major cellular sources of hBD-3 in septic loosening  but fibroblasts and foreign body giant cells can also contribute to its production. The heterogeneous topological staining of hBD-3 suggests local regulation  possibly by bacterial products  damage-associated molecular patterns and cytokines. The results explain the increased synovial fluid/tissue concentrations of hBD-3 in septic loosening.
Electrochemistry,,,Formation and retention of staphylococcal biofilms on DLC and its hybrids compared to metals used as biomaterials. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus cause most of the implant-related infections. Antibiotic treatment often fails and cure requires surgical intervention. It was hypothesized that biomaterial coatings resistant to biofilms offer a preventive option. Physical vapour deposited diamond-like carbon (DLC) and its polytetrafluoroethylene (DLC-PTFE-h) and polydimethylsiloxane (DLC-PDMS-h) hybrids were compared to titanium (Ti)  tantalum (Ta) and chromium (Cr) thin films on silicon wafers for their resistance against formation and/or retention of biofilms produced by S. epidermidis and S. aureus in vitro. Sample surfaces were characterized for surface topography  contact angle and zeta-potential  because such properties might affect the biofilm. Biofilm was stained using calcofluor white and analysed in fluorescence microscopy using morphometry. Sixteen hour incubation was selected in pilot tests; at this checkpoint Ti  Ta  Cr and DLC-PDMS-h were almost fully covered by biofilm  but DLC and DLC-PTFE-h were only partially biofilm coated by S. epidermidis (88±26%  p<0.001 and 56±39%  p<0.001  respectively) or S. aureus (81±24%  p<0.001 and 51±26%  p<0.001  respectively). DLC and its PTFE hybrid offer a potential biofilm hostile surface coating for implants and medical devices. This ability to resist biofilm formation and attachment could not be explained by only one factor  but it seems to be related to a combination of various properties  with electrokinetic streaming potential and protein coating being particularly important for its outcome.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Distribution of prolyl oligopeptidase in human peripheral tissues and in ovarian and colorectal tumors. Prolyl oligopeptidase (PREP) is a serine protease that hydrolyzes peptides shorter than 30-mer  and it has been connected with multiple physiological and pathological conditions. PREP has been mostly studied in the brain  but significant PREP activities have been measured in peripheral tissues. Moreover  increased PREP activities have been found in tumors. In this study  the authors studied the immunohistochemical distribution of PREP protein in human peripheral tissues and in ovarian and colorectal tumors. PREP was found to be widely distributed in human peripheral tissues and specifically in certain cells. The most intense PREP expression was seen in the testis  ovaries  liver  and some parts of the skin. At the cellular level  high PREP levels were seen as a rule in secreting epithelial cells and cells involved in reproduction. Increased PREP expression was seen in most of the tumors studied. PREP expression was higher in malignant than benign tumors  and in ovarian epithelial cancers  there was a trend for increased PREP staining with increased malignancy grade. Results suggest that PREP may be associated with secretory processes as well as in reproduction. A more abundant expression of PREP in malignant than benign tumors suggests that PREP may be associated with expansion and metastasis of tumors.
Immunohistochemistry,,,OSBP-related protein 11 (ORP11) dimerizes with ORP9 and localizes at the Golgi-late endosome interface. We characterize here ORP11  a member of the oxysterol-binding protein family. ORP11 is present at highest levels in human ovary  testis  kidney  liver  stomach  brain  and adipose tissue. Immunohistochemistry demonstrates abundant ORP11 in the epithelial cells of kidney tubules  testicular tubules  caecum  and skin. ORP11 in HEK293 cells resides on Golgi complex and LE  co-localizing with GFP-Rab9  TGN46  GFP-Rab7  and a fluorescent medial-trans-Golgi marker. Under electron microscopic observation  cells overexpressing ORP11 displayed lamellar lipid bodies associated with vacuolar structures or the Golgi complex  indicating a disturbance of lipid trafficking. N-terminal fragment of ORP11 (aa 1-292) localized partially to Golgi  but displayed enhanced localization on Rab7- and Rab9-positive LE  while the C-terminal ligand-binding domain (aa 273-747) was cytosolic  demonstrating that the membrane targeting determinants are N-terminal. Yeast two-hybrid screen revealed interaction of ORP11 with the related ORP9. The interacting region was delineated within aa 98-372 of ORP9 and aa 154-292 of ORP11. Overexpressed ORP9 was able to recruit EGFP-ORP11 to membranes  and ORP9 silencing inhibited ORP11 Golgi association. The results identify ORP11 as an OSBP homologue distributing at the Golgi-LE interface and define the ORP9-ORP11 dimer as a functional unit that may act as an intracellular lipid sensor or transporter.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Peptidylglycine-alpha-amidating monooxygenase and pro-atrial natriuretic peptide constitute the major membrane-associated proteins of rat atrial secretory granules. Peptidylglycine-alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) is a bi-functional enzyme known to catalyze the post-translational bioactivation of signaling peptides. Although PAM is highly concentrated within the cardiac atrium  this tissue does not produce appreciable amounts of alpha-amidated peptides and thus  the function of PAM in atrium remains largely unknown. In this study  we demonstrate that PAM co-localizes in atrial secretory granules with the storage form of atrial natriuretic peptide (pro-ANP  amino acids 1-126)  a hormone involved in the maintenance of blood pressure and fluid homeostasis. ANP is not amidated by PAM  but rather is processed to its active form (amino acids 99-126) by the proteolytic cleavage of pro-ANP. We demonstrate here by subcellular fractionation and biochemical analyses that PAM co-localizes with pro-ANP in secretory granules  where together they constitute the two most abundant membrane-associated proteins  accounting for approximately 95% of the total granular membrane protein. Respectively  light and electron microscopic immunohistochemistry show intense staining for PAM in atrial cardiomyocyctes and subcellular localization of PAM to secretory granules. Additionally  we demonstrate that while pro-ANP is readily found in the soluble contents of the granule lumen  significant amounts remain tightly associated with the membranes even after vigorous washing and estimate the molar ratio of pro-ANP to PAM to be approximately 30:1 in the membrane fraction. We postulate here that the primary function of PAM in the atrium is structural rather than enzymatic. In this regard  PAM may contribute to the packaging of pro-ANP within the secretory granule and possibly function in the presentation of pro-ANP for proteolytic processing.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Prediction of Recurrence and Survival for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) by a Protein Signature in Tissue Samples. To date  there is no available targeted therapy for patients who are diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC). The aim of this study was to identify a new specific target for specific treatments. Frozen primary tumors were collected from 83 adjuvant therapy-naive TNBC patients. These samples were used for global proteome profiling by iTRAQ-OFFGEL-LC-MS/MS approach in two series: a training cohort (n = 42) and a test set (n = 41). Patients who remains free of local or distant metastasis for a minimum of 5 years after surgery were classified in the no-relapse group; the others were in the relapse group. OPLS and Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed to select candidate markers  which were validated by immunohistochemistry. Three proteins were identified in the training set and validated in the test set by Kaplan-Meier method and immunohistochemistry (IHC): TrpRS as a good prognostic markers and DP and TSP1 as bad prognostic markers. We propose the establishment of an IHC test to calculate the score of TrpRS  DP  and TSP1 in TNBC tumors to evaluate the degree of aggressiveness of the tumors. Finally  we propose that DP and TSP1 could provide therapeutic targets for specific treatments.
Computational Biology,Immunohistochemistry,,Gene-expression molecular subtyping of triple-negative breast cancer tumours: importance of immune response. Triple-negative breast cancers need to be refined in order to identify therapeutic subgroups of patients. We conducted an unsupervised analysis of microarray gene-expression profiles of 107 triple-negative breast cancer patients and undertook robust functional annotation of the molecular entities found by means of numerous approaches including immunohistochemistry and gene-expression signatures. A triple-negative external cohort (n=87) was used for validation. Fuzzy clustering separated triple-negative tumours into three clusters: C1 (22.4%)  C2 (44.9%) and C3 (32.7%). C1 patients were older (mean=64.6 years) than C2 (mean=56.8 years; P=0.03) and C3 patients (mean=51.9 years; P=0.0004). Histological grade and Nottingham prognostic index were higher in C2 and C3 than in C1 (P<0.0001 for both comparisons). Significant event-free survival (P=0.03) was found according to cluster membership: patients belonging to C3 had a better outcome than patients in C1 (P=0.01) and C2 (P=0.02). Event-free survival analysis results were confirmed when our cohort was pooled with the external cohort (n=194; P=0.01). Functional annotation showed that 22% of triple-negative patients were not basal-like (C1). C1 was enriched in luminal subtypes and positive androgen receptor (luminal androgen receptor). C2 could be considered as an almost pure basal-like cluster. C3  enriched in basal-like subtypes but to a lesser extent  included 26% of claudin-low subtypes. Dissection of immune response showed that high immune response and low M2-like macrophages were a hallmark of C3  and that these patients had a better event-free survival than C2 patients  characterized by low immune response and high M2-like macrophages: P=0.02 for our cohort  and P=0.03 for pooled cohorts. We identified three subtypes of triple-negative patients: luminal androgen receptor (22%)  basal-like with low immune response and high M2-like macrophages (45%)  and basal-enriched with high immune response and low M2-like macrophages (33%). We noted out that macrophages and other immune effectors offer a variety of therapeutic targets in breast cancer  and particularly in triple-negative basal-like tumours. Furthermore  we showed that CK5 antibody was better suited than CK5/6 antibody to subtype triple-negative patients.
Proteomics,,,Inherited cancer predisposition sensitizes colonic mucosa to address Western diet effects and putative cancer-predisposing changes on mouse proteome. Human epidemiological evidence and previous studies on mice have shown that Western-style diet (WD) may predispose gut mucosa to colorectal cancer (CRC). The mechanisms that mediate the effects of diet on tumorigenesis are largely unknown. To address putative cancer-predisposing events available for early detection  we quantitatively analyzed the proteome of histologically normal colon of a wild-type (Mlh1(+/+)) and an Mlh1(+/-) mouse after a long-term feeding experiment with WD and AIN-93G control diet. The Mlh1(+/-) mouse carries susceptibility to colon cancer analogous to a human CRC syndrome (Lynch syndrome). Remarkably  WD induced expression changes reflecting metabolic disturbances especially in the cancer-predisposed colon  while similar changes were not significant in the wild-type proteome. Overall  the detected changes constitute a complex interaction network of proteins involved in ATP synthesis coupled proton transport  oxidoreduction coenzyme and nicotinamide nucleotide metabolic processes  important in cell protection against reactive oxygen species toxicity. Of these proteins  selenium binding protein 1 and galectin-4  which directly interact with MutL homolog 1  are underlined in neoplastic processes  suggesting that sensitivity to WD is increased by an Mlh1 mutation. The significance of WD on CRC risk is highlighted by the fact that five out of six mice with neoplasias were fed with WD.
Immunohistochemistry,,,A de novo germline MLH1 mutation in a Lynch syndrome patient with discordant immunohistochemical and molecular biology test results. We describe a patient with a Homo sapiens mutL homolog 1 (MLH1)-associated Lynch syndrome with previous diagnoses of two distinct primary cancers: a sigmoid colon cancer at the age of 39 years  and a right colon cancer at the age of 50 years. The mutation identified in his blood and buccal cells  c.1771delG  p.Asp591Ilefs*25  appears to be a de novo event  as it was not transmitted by either of his parents. This type of de novo event is rare in MLH1 as only three cases have been reported in the literature so far. Furthermore  the discordant results observed between replication error phenotyping and immunohistochemistry highlight the importance of the systematic use of both pre-screening tests in the molecular diagnosis of Lynch syndrome.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Immunoglobulin G4-positive ascending thoracic aortitis may be prone to dissection. Immunoglobulin (Ig) G4-positive aortitis may determine outcome after surgery for ascending aorta. We evaluated IgG4 expression of dilated ascending aortic wall. The study consisted of 91 patients who underwent ascending aortic surgery. For histology  hematoxylin-eosin  elastase-van Gieson  and periodic acid-Schiff stainings were performed. The amount of T and B lymphocytes  plasma cells  macrophages  cell proliferation  and IgG4 positivity were determined by immunohistochemistry. The aortic wall in 12 patients had IgG4 positivity that was always confined to the adventitia. Adventitial plasma cells were numerous in all but 2 of these patients (P < .0001). Aortitis was revealed in 2 patients (17%) with IgG4-positive staining of the aorta and in 6 patients (8%) with IgG4 negativity. IgG4 staining was significantly associated with total aortic wall inflammation (area under the curve  0.865; standard error  0.043; P = .000; 95% confidence interval  0.779-0.950). The mean diameter of the ascending aorta was 69 ± 4.7 mm and 56 ± 1.1 mm in patients with IgG4 positivity and negativity  respectively (P < .004). Approximately half of the patients with IgG4 positivity had dissection (42%)  compared with only 15 of 79 (19%) of the remaining patients (P = not significant). Two patients with IgG4 positivity had to undergo reoperation because of immediate postoperative dissection. Seven patients died  including 4 patients (33%) with IgG4 positivity; the remaining 3 patients (4%) were IgG4 negative (P < .005). IgG4-positive ascending aortic wall was frequent in our study cohort (13%) and revealed aortic inflammation associated with dilatation.
Family Practice,Patient Education as Topic,,[Allergy in general practice in Arhus County. Quality assessment of diagnosis  treatment and instructions to patients. III. Allergy testing]. The aim of this study was to compare the allergy test with the skin prick test and the specific IgE by Phadiatop test to a purely clinical allergy diagnosis by an allergy specialist in adult patients previously tested in general practice. A total of 103 patients suspected of having asthma and/or rhinitis were re-evaluated with a clinical diagnosis and the two allergy tests. Both the patient and the individual general practitioner were asked about existing allergy diagnosis. The two test systems showed large differences in a semiquantitative linear system with an explained variation (r2) of only 8%. In comparison to a purely clinical diagnosis  they were diagnostically equal with both tests  with an additional 15% positive reactions of which 25% were judged clinically active. Both tests resulted in about 33% false-positive tests classified as clinically inactive. In the case of a positive Phadiatop test and clinically active allergy  both the patient and the general practitioner reported identical specialist diagnoses in about 75% of cases  while in 20-50% of the cases an identical diagnosis was reported when the clinical diagnosis was qualitatively different from the result of Phadiatop. The results of the two test systems often differ  and they both detect extra positive tests  in which case they should be used in a serial manner. Both tests often result in a false-positive diagnosis  and identification of clinically relevant positive tests often requires an experienced medical evaluation.
Family Practice,Patient Education as Topic,,[Allergy in general practice in Arhus County. Quality assessment of diagnosis  treatment and instructions to patients: II. Rhinitis]. The aim of this study was to evaluate adult patients in general practice suspected of having rhinitis. A total of 72 patients suspected of having rhinitis underwent a secondary specialist investigation  resulting in 55 final specialist diagnoses of rhinitis. Through interviews of patients and a questionnaire mailed to the primary physician  information on diagnostic strategy  final diagnosis  suggested treatments and patients' knowledge about rhinitis were determined. One third of the 72 patients examined for possible rhinitis would have benefited from a supplementary specialist examination  where one group was made up of patients with negative allergy tests and chronic symptoms of either non-rhinitis disease or vasomotoric rhinitis and the other group was made up of patients with severe seasonal allergic rhinitis  who would benefit from immunotherapy. The suggested medical treatments followed modern treatment principles. Of the patients with a final diagnosis of rhinitis  only one third were informed about treatment principles with inhalation steroids  while half of the patients knew about the basic principles of antihistamine treatment. Of 53 patients with rhinitis  6 were prepared to change medical treatment without first contacting their physician. Patients with chronic or recurrent symptoms should be referred to specialists more often  and patients who might benefit from allergen-specific treatment  such as immunotherapy or allergen prevention  should be evaluated by an allergy specialist. Patients with rhinitis should be given more information on disease mechanisms and treatment principles.
Family Practice,Patient Education as Topic,,[Allergy in general practice in Arhus County. Quality assessment of diagnosis  treatment and instructions to patients: I. Asthma]. The aim of this study was to evaluate adult patients examined in general practice on suspicion of having asthma. A total of 46 patients suspected of having asthma underwent a second specialist investigation  which demonstrated that 28 of them had asthma. Through interviews of patients and a questionnaire completed by the primary physician  information on diagnostic strategy  general practice diagnosis  suggested treatments and patients' knowledge about asthma was determined. In 65% of the patients investigated for possible asthma in general practice  the specialist examination did not provide any major suggestions for changes  while one in every three patients would have benefited from a secondary specialist examination. The largest group was 7 of 18 patients who did not have asthma but who suffered from chronic or recurrent symptoms. Also  one in four of the patients with a final diagnosis of asthma would have benefited from a specialist examination because of uncertain diagnosis  disease severity and/or the possibility of allergen-specific treatment. The medical treatments suggested by the general practitioners followed modern treatment principles. Just over half of the patients with a final specialist diagnosis of asthma were familiar with the basic disease mechanisms  but only 7% of them would change their therapy in relation to disease severity without first contacting their physicians. Patients with chronic or recurrent symptoms should be referred to specialists more often  and patients who could potentially benefit from allergen-specific treatment  such as allergen prevention  should be evaluated by an allergy specialist. There is a need for increased patient education.
Genetic Counseling,,,[Head and neck paragangliomas]. Head and neck paragangliomas (HNPGs) are rare tumours of neural crest origin that are benign in the majority of cases. In this article HNPGs are outlined with emphasis on genetic predisposition  diagnostics and counselling. The literature on HNPGs identified using PubMed is reviewed. Several susceptibility genes have been identified and hereditary mutations are detectable in 30% of the patients with HNPGs. Genetic analyses  guided by the family history and clinical findings  should be offered to all patients with HNPGs and at risk relatives.
Epidemiology,,,Readmission and mortality in patients discharged with a diagnosis of medical observation and evaluation (Z03*-codes) from an acute admission unit in Denmark: a prospective cohort study. We assessed the 30-day risk of readmission and mortality among patients receiving an International Classification of Diseases 10th edition diagnosis of medical observation and evaluation (Z03*) following admission to an acute medical admission unit (AMAU)  stratified on any further specification of diagnosis during hospital stay. We used Central Denmark's (Midt)-Electronic Patient Journal to identify patients with a Z03*-diagnosis among patients admitted to the AMAU  Aarhus University Hospital Nørrebrogade from April 2012 to March 2013  and noted any specification of diagnosis. Patients were followed from hospital discharge until death  emigration  or completion of 30 days follow-up. Of 409 patients with an initial Z03* diagnosis at the AMAU  55% (n = 226) received a more specific discharge diagnosis after transferral to other departments. Among patients discharged to home with a Z03*-diagnosis  30% were readmitted within 30 days  while the corresponding figure was 23% for patients receiving a specific diagnosis (p = 0.06). In contrast  corresponding figures for 30-day mortality were 3% for Z03*-diagnosed patients and 10% for those who obtained a specific diagnosis (p = 0.003). Patients diagnosed with Z03* at hospital discharge have a substantially lower 30-day mortality  but a higher readmission-rate  compared to patients who obtain a specific diagnosis during the entire hospital stay.
Research Design,,,Time-differentiated target temperature management after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a multicentre  randomised  parallel-group  assessor-blinded clinical trial (the TTH48 trial): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial. The application of therapeutic hypothermia (TH) for 12 to 24 hours following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) has been associated with decreased mortality and improved neurological function. However  the optimal duration of cooling is not known. We aimed to investigate whether targeted temperature management (TTM) at 33 ± 1 °C for 48 hours compared to 24 hours results in a better long-term neurological outcome. The TTH48 trial is an investigator-initiated pragmatic international trial in which patients resuscitated from OHCA are randomised to TTM at 33 ± 1 °C for either 24 or 48 hours. Inclusion criteria are: age older than 17 and below 80 years; presumed cardiac origin of arrest; and Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) <8  on admission. The primary outcome is neurological outcome at 6 months using the Cerebral Performance Category score (CPC) by an assessor blinded to treatment allocation and dichotomised to good (CPC 1-2) or poor (CPC 3-5) outcome. Secondary outcomes are: 6-month mortality  incidence of infection  bleeding and organ failure and CPC at hospital discharge  at day 28 and at day 90 following OHCA. Assuming that 50 % of the patients treated for 24 hours will have a poor outcome at 6 months  a study including 350 patients (175/arm) will have 80 % power (with a significance level of 5 %) to detect an absolute 15 % difference in primary outcome between treatment groups. A safety interim analysis was performed after the inclusion of 175 patients. This is the first randomised trial to investigate the effect of the duration of TTM at 33 ± 1 °C in adult OHCA patients. We anticipate that the results of this trial will add significant knowledge regarding the management of cooling procedures in OHCA patients. NCT01689077.
Qualitative Research,Telemedicine,,Geographic information system data from ambulances applied in the emergency department: effects on patient reception. Emergency departments (ED) recognize crowding and handover from prehospital to in-hospital settings to be major challenges. Prehospital Geographical Information Systems (GIS) may be a promising tool to address such issues. In this study  the use of prehospital GIS data was implemented in an ED in order to investigate its effect on 1) wait time and unprepared activations of Trauma Teams (TT) and Medical Emergency Teams (MET) and 2) nurses' perceptions regarding patient reception  workflow and resource utilization.  From May 1st 2014 to October 31th 2014  GIS data was displayed in the ED. Data included real-time estimated time of arrival  distance to ED  dispatch criteria  patient data and ambulance contact information. Data was used by coordinating nurses for time activation of TT and MET involved in the initial treatment of severely-injured or critically-ill patients. In addition  it was used as a logistics tool for handling all other patients transported by ambulance to the ED. The study followed a mixed-methods design  consisting of a quantitative study (before and after intervention) and a qualitative study (survey and interviews). Participants included all patients received by TT or MET and coordinating nurses in the ED. 1.) Quantitative: 599 patients were included. The median wait time for TT and MET was 5 min both before and after the GIS intervention  showing no difference (p = 0.18). A significant reduction in the subgroup of waits >10 min was found (p < 0.05). No difference was found in unprepared TT and MET activations. 2.) Qualitative: Nurses perceived GIS data as a tool to optimize resource utilization and quality of all patients' reception  critically or non-critically ill. No substantial disadvantages were reported. The contradiction of measured median wait time and nurses perceived improved timing of team activation may result from having both RT- ETA and supplemental patient information not only for seriously-injured or critically-ill patients received by the TT and MET  but for all patients transported by ambulance. The reduction in waits > 10 minutes may have contributed to the overall perception of reduced wait time  as avoidance of long waits is clinically more important than reduction in the median wait time. A comparison of the use of prehospital GIS data in the ED with the control period showed no effect on median wait time for TT and MET  however  the number of waits of >10 min was reduced. On the other hand  nurses perceived implementation of GIS data as improving workflow  resource utilization and quality of all patients' reception  critically as well as non-critically ill. There were no substantial disadvantages to the GIS application. ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02188966).
Epidemiology,,,Completeness and validity in a national clinical thyroid cancer database: DATHYRCA. Although a prospective national clinical thyroid cancer database (DATHYRCA) has been active in Denmark since January 1  1996  no assessment of data quality has been performed. The purpose of the study was to evaluate completeness and data validity in the Danish national clinical thyroid cancer database: DATHYRCA. National prospective cohort. Denmark; population 5.5 million. Completeness of case ascertainment was estimated by the independent case ascertainment method using three governmental registries as a reference. The reabstracted record method was used to appraise the validity. For validity assessment 100 cases were randomly selected from the DATHYRCA database; medical records were used as a reference. The database held 1934 cases of thyroid carcinoma and completeness of case ascertainment was estimated to 90.9%. Completeness of registration was around or above 90% in most instances. Perfect agreement on the diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma was found  both inter- and intra-observer  and κ values of selected variables showed overall good to excellent agreement. In a setup with public health insurance  personal identity numbers and extended governmental databases  it is possible to establish national clinical cancer databases with a satisfactory completeness and validity. The DATHYRCA database is considered reliable in terms of describing thyroid carcinoma at a national level.

Clinical Competence,General Practice,Medical Oncology,Shared care is a model for patients with stable prostate cancer. Patients with prostate cancer (PC) have so far been followed in specialised hospital departments after diagnosis and initiation of treatment. The main obstacles associated with the transfer of this activity to general practice include lack of experience and uncertainty as to whether general practitioners (GPs) can handle follow-up. A Steering Committee was established in collaboration with health-care professionals to devise a strategy for a shared care model. An action plan was designed that included 1) the development of a shared care model for follow-up and treatment  2) implementation of the shared care model in cooperation between the parties involved  3) design of procedures for re-referral  and 4) evaluation of effect  change processes and contextual factors. A total of 2 585 patients with PC were included in the study: 1 172 had disseminated disease  754 had no recurrence after curative treatment  244 who had been treated with a curative intent were being treated for relapse  186 underwent watchful waiting  135 underwent active surveillance  while other scenarios applied in the remaining 94 cases. A total of 530 patients were transferred to follow-up with a GP and 2 055 were not transferred to their GP. The main reason why patients were considered not suitable for transfer to primary health care was the patients' own desire (33%)  followed by clinical or biochemical disease progression (33%). The evaluation found that 96% of the patients were very comfortable with the permanent or temporary closure of the hospital course. The project focused on factors that are essential for the successful transfer of responsibility for long-term follow-up of patients with prostate cancer. Patient transfer succeeded with high initial patient satisfaction. not relevant. not relevant.
Clinical Competence,,,[Radical prostatectomies for localized prostate cancer performed in center satellite collaboration--is it possible?]. In an effort to comply with the increasing demand for surgery for localized prostate cancer a center satellite collaboration was established between a university department and two local urological departments. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate open radical prostatectomies performed by this collaboration. The centre satellite collaboration included preoperative evaluation and treatment at local hospitals and evaluation of operative results by audit every 6 months. 104 patients were operated during the study period. 4 patients were excluded due to findings of carcinoma in lymph nodes examined by frozen section. This study describes the first 100 radical prostatectomies. Median operating time was 85 minutes (60-175) and median hospitalization was 6 days (5-23). 18 patients received blood transfusions in relation to surgery. Perioperative mortality was 0. Histological examination of prostatectomy specimens revealed that 70 patients had a localised prostate cancer (organ confined tumour) and were considered cured for their cancer. Few patients had full urinary control (no pads) at 6 weeks control  and at 12 months control 49 of 50 controlled patients were considered continent. Potency was a major problem. 22% of the 50 patients evaluated after 12 months had PSA recurrence and almost all were given adjuvant hormonal treatment. Radical prostatectomy performed in collaboration between a university department and local urological departments as described is beneficial to both patients and the departments involved. Postoperative results matching larger departments can be achieved.
Medical Laboratory Science,,,[Development of an Internet search strategy to identify new medical technologies in prostate cancer]. Technological change is rapid in medicine. The Internet is becoming more and more important as a source of keeping abreast of technological change  but tools to aid clinicians in finding relevant information on the Internet are lacking. The objective of this project was to develop an Internet search strategy to identify new technologies for the treatment of localised prostate cancer. Web sites were found by means of a literature search and by searching specific Internet sources. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were developed based on literature and applied to a variety of potentially relevant sites. An initial strategy was developed  technologies identified  and the novelty and relevance were assessed by urologists in the team. This information was used to adjust the strategy. 6 general urologists assessed the efficiency of the strategy. Their input was used to define a final listing of sites. The strategy consists of 10 sites which should be visited in the following order: YahooHealth  DoctorsGuide  The National Electronic Library for Medicines  CancerPage  Medscape  MedlinePlus  HealthAndAge  CancerConsultants  EurekAlert  Oncolink. Links to the exact sites are provided at www.ugeskriftet.dk. This study resulted in an Internet search strategy to identify new medical technologies for a well-defined indication. The methods used may be useful in order to develop similar strategies in other clinical areas in urology or other specialties.
Clinical Competence,,,[Outcome of open and laparoscopic nephrectomies in a county hospital--centralization]. The results of conventional open and laparoscopic nephrectomy in a six-year period from a county hospital are presented. In the period June 1st 1995 to June 2nd 2005  a total of 123 nephrectomies were performed. One hundred and five patients had cancer of whom 85 were operated (46 by laparoscopy and 39 by open surgery). Thirty-eight patients were operated due to a benign disease e.g. non-functional kidney  stone disease etc. There were 105 patients (54 men  51 women) with cancer and 85 were operated. The hospital stay was seven days (2-29) for open surgery. The need for transfusion was 0 units (0-8 units). In 55% of the cases the operation was performed by a senior registrar. Crude survival was 60%. Overall mortality was 1.6% (2 patients). It is concluded that nephrectomy  both conventional open and laparoscopical  can safely be performed at a county hospital in terms of surgery  hospital stay  morbidity and mortality. If it is technically feasible one should offer the patient laparoscopic treatment. The operation has a high educational value for surgeons in urological training.
Clinical Competence,Needs Assessment,,Prostate-specific antigen testing in general practice: a survey among 325 general practitioners in Denmark. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a well-known and -utilized tumor marker for prostate cancer. Elevated PSA values are not specific for prostate cancer as they may be caused by other benign conditions. PSA testing is widely used by urologists and non-urologists. Interpretation of test results is difficult but important. Referral of patients for further work-up on suspicion of prostate diseases is mainly done by general practitioners (GPs). As the GP remains the gatekeeper between the patient and the urologist in terms of diagnosing prostate diseases  basic knowledge of PSA testing is crucial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the basic use and knowledge of PSA testing and to give an estimate of the need for further education in PSA testing amongst GPs in our area. A questionnaire regarding PSA testing and associated needs for education was mailed to all GPs in the Northern County of Denmark. Non-respondents were contacted by mail. Of the contacted GPs  90% responded. Only 28% of GPs measured PSA in all males complaining of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Of patients seen as part of a general health check-up  PSA testing was done in 10%. The median PSA value for referral to urologists for further work-up was 5 ng/ml  but the decision was influenced by PSA value (79%)  age (65%) and findings on digital rectal examination (DRE) (87%). Opportunistic screening for prostate cancer was done by 14% of GPs. Of the GPs who responded  24% stated that they did not need any further education regarding PSA testing. The results of this study demonstrate that PSA testing is not standardized in our area. GPs do not test patients on the basis of recommendations provided by national or international societies. PSA testing is not used as a standard test in men with LUTS  and patients are not referred to urologists at a sufficiently low PSA level to improve the early diagnosis and work-up of patients with suspected prostate cancer. However  the decision of many GPs to refer patients to urologists for further work-up is influenced by the findings of a DRE  the age of the patient and the PSA value itself. Further education regarding PSA testing amongst GPs in our area would seem to be appropriate.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Dietary carbohydrate restriction as the first approach in diabetes management: critical review and evidence base. The inability of current recommendations to control the epidemic of diabetes  the specific failure of the prevailing low-fat diets to improve obesity  cardiovascular risk  or general health and the persistent reports of some serious side effects of commonly prescribed diabetic medications  in combination with the continued success of low-carbohydrate diets in the treatment of diabetes and metabolic syndrome without significant side effects  point to the need for a reappraisal of dietary guidelines. The benefits of carbohydrate restriction in diabetes are immediate and well documented. Concerns about the efficacy and safety are long term and conjectural rather than data driven. Dietary carbohydrate restriction reliably reduces high blood glucose  does not require weight loss (although is still best for weight loss)  and leads to the reduction or elimination of medication. It has never shown side effects comparable with those seen in many drugs. Here we present 12 points of evidence supporting the use of low-carbohydrate diets as the first approach to treating type 2 diabetes and as the most effective adjunct to pharmacology in type 1. They represent the best-documented  least controversial results. The insistence on long-term randomized controlled trials as the only kind of data that will be accepted is without precedent in science. The seriousness of diabetes requires that we evaluate all of the evidence that is available. The 12 points are sufficiently compelling that we feel that the burden of proof rests with those who are opposed.
Health Education,,,Need for more clear parental recommendations regarding foreign body aspiration in children. Foreign body (FB) aspiration is a common cause of respiratory emergency in early childhood and is associated with a high rate of airway distress. FB aspiration peaks at the age of 1-2 years. Factors placing children at higher risk include incomplete dentition  immature swallowing coordination and the tendency to be easily distracted while eating. Symptoms may vary from an un-affected child to impending airway failure. Mucosal cough receptors often accommodate and the child may be asymptomatic when evaluated. Files of children (0-15 years) admitted with suspected FB aspiration were reviewed. Patients were included if the FB was confirmed by bronchoscopy. Among 136 children undergoing bronchoscopy  a FB was confirmed in 59 patients. The median age was one year. All children had a history of aspiration and in 48% a persistent cough was present at the initial examination. Eleven children (19%) had a normal physical examination at admission. Nuts were identified in 34% and carrots in 20%. Of the FBs removed  86% were organic and 14% were inorganic. Organic FBs were more common in patients younger than three years (p < 0.001). Parental suspicion of FB aspiration indicates acute bronchoscopy in children  even in case of no abnormal findings. The completion of the bronchoscopy within 24 hours facilitates the examination and reduces the risk of complications. We recommend increased awareness of the hazards associated with small crunchy organic food items  especially nuts and carrots  given to children under three years of age. not relevant. not relevant.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Optimizing 131I uptake after rhTSH stimulation in patients with nontoxic multinodular goiter: evidence from a prospective  randomized  double-blind study. Prestimulation with recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone (rhTSH) augments radioiodine (131)I therapy for benign nontoxic multinodular goiter. The purpose of this study was to determine the optimal time interval between rhTSH and (131)I administration to enhance thyroid radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU). Patients were randomized  in a 2-factorial design  to receive either a 0.1-mg dose of rhTSH (n = 60) or placebo (n = 30) and to a time interval of 24  48  or 72 h before (131)I administration. The rhTSH- or placebo-stimulated RAIU study was performed at 4 wk after a baseline RAIU assessment in a tertiary referral center at a university hospital. A total of 90 patients (78 women; median age  52 y; range  22-83 y) referred to (131)I therapy for symptomatic nontoxic goiter (median goiter volume  63 mL; range  25-464 mL) were included in the study. Change in thyroid RAIU was determined at 24 and 96 h after (131)I tracer administration. In the placebo subgroups  RAIU did not change significantly from baseline. The mean (+/-SE) 24-h RAIU increased from 33.8% +/- 2.3% to 66.0% +/- 1.8% (111.2% increase) with a 24-h interval  from 36.8% +/- 2.1% to 64.6% +/- 2.7% (83.3% increase) with a 48-h interval  and from 33.0% +/- 2.7% to 49.6% +/- 2.5% (62.4% increase) with a 72-h interval. All within-group changes were highly significant (P < 0.001). The effect was negatively correlated with initial RAIU (r = -0.703  P < 0.001). The increase in 24- and 96-h RAIU was significantly higher in the rhTSH/24-h group than it was in the rhTSH/72-h group (P = 0.023 and 0.012  respectively) and insignificantly higher than in the rhTSH/48-h group (P = 0.37 and 0.26  respectively). The effect of rhTSH on thyroid RAIU is most pronounced when administered 24 h before (131)I administration and declines with longer time intervals. Whether there is a similar time dependency for goiter reduction after rhTSH-stimulated (131)I-therapy remains to be clarified.
Outcome Assessment (Health Care),,,Impact of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography staging in newly diagnosed classical Hodgkin lymphoma: fewer cases with stage I disease and more with skeletal involvement. (18)F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/ computed tomography (PET/CT) is a highly accurate staging method in classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). We retrospectively compared the staging results obtained in two large cohorts of patients with cHL diagnosed before (n = 324) and after (n = 406) the introduction of PET/CT staging in a retrospective study. In PET/CT staged patients  stage I disease was less frequent (16% vs. 27%  p < 0.001) while stage IV disease was more frequent (17% vs. 10%  p = 0.02). Imaging-detected skeletal involvement was recognized more often in PET/CT staged patients (17% vs. 2%  p < 0.001)  and the presence of focal skeletal PET/CT lesions was associated with higher risk of progression (hazard ratio [HR] 1.96  95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14-3.36). The German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) risk classification (early  intermediate  advanced disease) predicted outcome in PET/CT staged patients. In conclusion  PET/CT led to higher disease stages  and the more frequently diagnosed skeletal lesions may be an adverse prognostic factor.
Epidemiology,,,Negative affect is associated with development and persistence of chemical intolerance: a prospective population-based study. Chemical intolerance (CI) is characterised by negative health effects attributed to a heightened responsiveness to common airborne chemicals. This longitudinal study explored the hypothesised role of negative affect in the development and persistence of CI in a general population. A general population sample aged 19 to 72 years was examined in 2006-2008 and again in 2011-2012. Longitudinal data on CI were analysed with the purpose of examining baseline negative affect as a risk factor for having developed CI at 5-year follow-up and for reporting persistent CI. Participants were classified as reporting no signs of CI  having symptoms of CI and as being a likely CI case based on self-reported reactions to 11 common chemical exposures  symptoms related to chemical exposures and daily life adjustments attributed to reactions when exposed to chemicals. A total of 69.4% of the participants who had reported CI at baseline also reported CI at follow-up. In participants with no baseline CI  15.5% reported CI at follow-up and 18.1% reported symptoms related to chemicals but no daily life adjustments. Baseline negative affect was positively and statistically significantly associated with both development and persistence of CI. Initial reports of CI were found to be persistent over time  and a considerable proportion of the participants with no CI at baseline reported having developed CI after 5 years. The positive association between negative affect and CI at the 5-year follow-up supports negative affect as a possible risk factor for CI.
Research Design,,,Transcranial pulsed electromagnetic fields for multiple chemical sensitivity: study protocol for a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial. Multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) is a chronic condition of unknown etiology. MCS is characterized by recurrent nonspecific symptoms from multiple organ systems in response to chemical exposures in concentrations that are normally tolerated by the majority of the population. The symptoms may have severe impact on patients' lives  but an evidence-based treatment for the condition is nonexisting. The pathophysiology is unclarified  but several indicators point towards abnormal processing of sensory signals in the central nervous system. Pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) offer a promising new treatment for refractory depression and can be targeted at the brain  thereby activating biochemical cell processes. In a parallel  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial conducted at the Danish Research Centre for Chemical Sensitivities  the effects of PEMF in MCS patients will be assessed using the Re5 Independent System. Based on sample size estimation  40 participants will be randomized to either PEMF therapy or placebo. The allocation sequence will be generated by computer. All involved parties (that is  participants  investigators  the research nurse  and the statistician) will be blinded to group allocation. The participants will receive PEMF therapy or placebo applied transcranially 30 minutes twice a day for 7 days a week over 6 consecutive weeks. Outcomes will be measured at baseline  once weekly during treatment  post treatment  and at 2.5-month and 4.5-month follow-up according to a predefined timetable. The primary outcome will be a measurement of the impact of MCS on everyday life. The secondary outcomes will be measurements of MCS symptoms  psychological distress (stress  anxiety or depressive symptoms)  capsaicin-induced secondary punctate hyperalgesia  immunological markers in serum  and quality of life. This trial will assess the effects of PEMF therapy for MCS. Currently  there is no treatment with a documented effect on MCS  and in terms of healthcare there is very little to offer these patients. There is thus a great need for well-conducted randomized trials aimed at assessing possible treatment effects. A positive outcome will pave the way for improved healthcare and understanding of this very disabling and overlooked condition. ClinicalTrials.gov  NCT01834781.
Patient Education as Topic,,,[Treatment of whiplash-associated disorders]. Treatment of whiplash-associated disorders starts with a thorough clinical examination  which may be repeated after 1-3 weeks. For optimal results it is essential that the patient receives clear information about the condition and that any pain is treated effectively with analgesics. Risk factors for persistent symptoms can often be identified early and should be addressed adequately. If symptoms persist and conservative treatments are chosen  these should be active and they should focus on sustaining or regaining usual activities.
Statistics as Topic,,,Functional and structural nerve fiber findings in heterozygote patients with Fabry disease. Fabry disease is an X-linked inherited lysosomal disorder with dysfunction of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-galactosidase A causing accumulation of glycolipids in multiple organs including the nervous system. Pain and somatosensory disturbances are prominent manifestations of this disease. Until recently disease manifestations in female carriers of Fabry disease have been questioned. To explore the frequency of symptoms and the functional and structural involvement of the nervous system in female patients we examined the presence of pain  manifestations of peripheral neuropathy and nerve density in skin biopsies in 19 female patients with Fabry disease and 19 sex- and age-matched controls. Diaries  quantitative sensory testing  neurophysiologic tests and skin biopsies were performed. Daily pain was present in 63% of patients  with a median VAS score of 4.0. Tactile detection threshold and pressure pain threshold were lower and cold detection thresholds increased in patients. Sensory nerve action potential amplitude and maximal sensory conduction velocity were not different  whereas there was a highly significant reduction in intraepidermal nerve fiber density. We found no correlation between pain VAS score  quantitative sensory testing and intraepidermal nerve fiber density. Our study demonstrates that careful evaluation of symptoms in female Fabry patients is important as small fiber disease manifestations are present  which in some cases is only detected by skin biopsy.
Patient Education as Topic,,,Education of patients after whiplash injury: is oral advice any better than a pamphlet? Randomized parallel-group trial with 1-year follow-up. To evaluate whether education of patients communicated orally by a specially trained nurse is superior to giving patients a pamphlet after a whiplash injury. Long-lasting pain and physical disability after whiplash injuries are related to both serious personal suffering and huge socio-economic costs. Pure educational interventions after such injuries seem generally as effective as more costly interventions  but it is unknown if the way advice is communicated is of any importance. Participants with relatively mild complaints after car collisions were recruited from emergency departments and GPs. A total of 182 participants were randomized to either: (1) a 1 hour-educational session with a specially trained nurse  or (2) an educational pamphlet. Outcome parameters were neck pain  headache  disability  and return to work. Recovery was defined as scoring pain 0 or 1 (0-10 point scale) and not being off sick at the time of the follow-ups. After 3  6  and 12 months 60%  58%  and 66%  respectively of the participants had recovered. Group differences were nonsignificant on all outcome parameters  even though the outcome tended to be better for the group receiving personal advice. Prognosis did not differ between patients who received personal education and those who got a pamphlet. However  a systematic tendency toward better outcome with personal communicated information was observed and the question how patients should be educated to reduce the risk of chronicity after whiplash is worth further investigation  since no treatment have been proven to prevent long-lasting symptoms  and all forms of advice or educational therapy are so cheap that even a modest effect justifies its use.
Research Design,,,Danish multicenter randomized study on fibrinolytic therapy versus acute coronary angioplasty in acute myocardial infarction: rationale and design of the DANish trial in Acute Myocardial Infarction-2 (DANAMI-2). Randomized trials have indicated that primary coronary angioplasty performed in patients admitted directly to highly-experienced angioplasty centers offers certain advantages over intravenous fibrinolytic therapy. However  the large majority of patients with acute myocardial infarction are submitted to hospitals without a catheterization laboratory. This means that additional transportation will be necessary for many patients if a strategy of acute coronary angioplasty is to be introduced as routine treatment. The delay of treatment caused by transportation might negate (part of) the benefits of primary angioplasty compared to fibrinolytic therapy given immediately at the local hospital. The DANish trial in Acute Myocardial Infarction-2 (DANAMI-2) is the first large-scale study to clarify  in a whole community  which of the 2 treatment strategies is best. A total of 1900 patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction are to be randomized: 800 patients will be admitted to invasive hospitals and 1100 patients will be admitted to referral hospitals. Half of the 1100 patients admitted to referral hospitals will immediately be transferred to an invasive center to be treated with primary angioplasty. If acute transfer from a local hospital to an angioplasty center is the superior strategy  primary angioplasty should be offered to all patients as routine treatment on a community basis.
Clinical Competence,Educational Measurement,,A new possibility in thoracoscopic virtual reality simulation training: development and testing of a novel virtual reality simulator for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery lobectomy. The aims of this study were to develop virtual reality simulation software for video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) lobectomy  to explore the opinions of thoracic surgeons concerning the VATS lobectomy simulator and to test the validity of the simulator metrics. Experienced VATS surgeons worked with computer specialists to develop a VATS lobectomy software for a virtual reality simulator. Thoracic surgeons with different degrees of experience in VATS were enrolled at the 22nd meeting of the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons (ESTS) held in Copenhagen in June 2014. The surgeons were divided according to the number of performed VATS lobectomies: novices (0 VATS lobectomies)  intermediates (1-49 VATS lobectomies) and experienced (>50 VATS lobectomies). The participants all performed a lobectomy of a right upper lobe on the simulator and answered a questionnaire regarding content validity. Metrics were compared between the three groups. We succeeded in developing the first version of a virtual reality VATS lobectomy simulator. A total of 103 thoracic surgeons completed the simulated lobectomy and were distributed as follows: novices n = 32  intermediates n = 45 and experienced n = 26. All groups rated the overall user realism of the VATS lobectomy scenario to a median of 5 on a scale 1-7  with 7 being the best score. The experienced surgeons found the graphics and movements realistic and rated the scenario high in terms of usefulness as a training tool for novice and intermediate experienced thoracic surgeons  but not very useful as a training tool for experienced surgeons. The metric scores were not statistically significant between groups. This is the first study to describe a commercially available virtual reality simulator for a VATS lobectomy. More than 100 thoracic surgeons found the simulator realistic  and hence it showed good content validity. However  none of the built-in simulator metrics could significantly distinguish between novice  intermediate experienced and experienced surgeons  and further development of the simulator software is necessary to develop valid metrics.
Outcome Assessment (Health Care),,,Coronary artery calcification detected in lung cancer screening predicts cardiovascular death. It remains unknown whether non-electrocardiogram-gated coronary artery calcium (CAC) score in lung cancer screening provides incremental prognostic value. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of CAC in the Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial (DLCST)  in addition to conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis including previously published studies regarding CAC in lung cancer screening. In DLCST  we measured Agatston CAC scores in 1 945 current and former smokers. Causes of death were extracted from the Danish National Death Registry. We used Cox proportional hazards model to determine hazard ratios (HRs) of CAC scores. A weighted fixed-effects model was used for the meta-analysis. Median follow-up in DLCST was 7.1 years  and 55% were men. Overall survival rates associated with CAC scores of 0  1-400  and > 400 were 98%  96%  and 92% (p < 0.001)  respectively. Adjusted HR of cardiovascular death associated with CAC >400 was 3.8 (1.0-15) (p < 0.05). The meta-analysis included 28 045 asymptomatic participants. A high non-gated CAC score was associated with fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular events (p < 0.0001). Assessment of non-electrocardiogram-gated CAC in lung cancer screening programs is a robust prognostic measure of fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular events in current and former smokers independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors.
Computational Biology,Proteomics,,Large-scale proteomics differentiates cholesteatoma from surrounding tissues and identifies novel proteins related to the pathogenesis. Cholesteatoma is the growth of keratinizing squamous epithelium in the middle ear. It is associated with severe complications and has a poorly understood etiopathogenesis. Here  we present the results from extensive bioinformatics analyses of the first large-scale proteomic investigation of cholesteatoma. The purpose of this study was to take an unbiased approach to identifying alterations in protein expression and in biological processes  in order to explain the characteristic phenotype of this skin-derived tumor. Five different human tissue types (cholesteatoma  neck of cholesteatoma  tympanic membrane  external auditory canal skin  and middle ear mucosa) were analyzed. More than 2 400 unique proteins were identified using nanoLC-MS/MS based proteomics (data deposited to the ProteomeXchange)  and 295 proteins were found to be differentially regulated in cholesteatoma. Validation analyses were performed by SRM mass spectrometry. Proteins found to be up- or down-regulated in cholesteatoma were analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and clustered into functional groups  for which activation state and associations to disease processes were predicted. Cholesteatoma contained high levels of pro-inflammatory S100 proteins  such as S100A7A and S100A7. Several proteases  such as ELANE  were up-regulated  whereas extracellular matrix proteins  such as COL18A1 and NID2  were under-represented. This may lead to alterations in integrity and differentiation of the tissue (as suggested by the up-regulation of KRT4 in the cholesteatoma). The presented data on the differential protein composition in cholesteatoma corroborate previous studies  highlight novel protein functionalities involved in the pathogenesis  and identify new areas for targeted research that hold therapeutic potential for the disease.
Pediatrics,,,The impact of legislation on drug substances used off-label in paediatric wards--a nationwide study. This nationwide study is aimed at describing to what extent the European Paediatric Regulation has met therapeutic needs in children. Data for each drug substance in defined daily doses (DDD) were extracted from the national Danish data base. We evaluated if drug substances were used off-label and whether they had a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). This study did not include drug prescriptions for individual paediatric patients; thus  it was not possible to make use of all off-label categories previously used. Additionally  paediatric standard assortments (SA) were compared to the European survey on paediatric medicinal products. Thirteen percent of the 100 most used drug substances were determined as being used off-label  four of which had a PIP and one had a full waiver. Only one of the three drug substances used off-label most often  accounting for 85 % of such use  had a PIP. Neonates were included in one-third of PIPs and adolescents in 15. Nineteen out of 21 PIPs had a waiver and 14 PIPs were deferred. In line with the European survey  carbapenems  corticosteroids and proton pump inhibitors were frequent found in SAs. PIPs only cover a small proportion of the drugs found to be used off-label in this study. Despite waivers granted  drug substances were used nonetheless. Unmet regulatory needs are still considerable in some therapeutic areas in neonates as well as in children.
Clinical Competence,,,[Medication problems in connection with transferral between sectors]. Prescribing involves careful considerations of outcome  duration of treatment and follow-up  and such considerations should be communicated to everyone involved in the medication process. Hospital admission and discharge involve a high risk of medication errors caused by unclear division of responsibilities  lack of communication  frequent exchanges between synonymous and analogous drugs  polypharmacy  compliance issues and insufficient education and training of staff. There is an obvious need for a joint internet-based online prescription system covering all physicians.
Patient Education as Topic,,,[Compliance to drug prescriptions]. Non-adherence or incomplete adherence to drug prescriptions is common. In long-term therapy for chronic disease  it has been estimated that only half of all drug doses are taken as prescribed. In this article we discuss poor adherence in terms of prevalence  clinical significance  treatment opportunities and ethical aspects.
Clinical Competence,,,[Optimization of use of prehospital emergency physicians after new dispatch and guidance instructions]. Correct use of prehospital medical competence requires optimal dispatch. Based on the severity gauge Severity of Injury/Illness Index (SIII) which grades injury/illness into eight levels  we examined the effect of implementing new dispatch and guidance instructions in the emergency call centre. From the local Prehospital Database we have withdrawn data from 1st August 2000 to 31st December 2005. On 1st August 2003 new dispatch and guidance instructions were implemented with a graded allocation of prehospital resources. It is hereby possible to dispatch 1) an ambulance + prehospital emergency physician (PEP); 2) an ambulance; or refer to 3) self care or alternative transportation. During the study 10 585 patients were attended by a PEP. After implementing the new dispatch and guidance instructions we experienced a total increase of five per cent in the four most severe SIII-groups. A total of 189 patients were transferred to the relevant groups. These changes are significant with p < 0 001 (chi2-test). By implementing more graded dispatch and guidance instructions in the emergency call centre it is possible to optimise the use of the PEP.
Clinical Medicine,,,Pyogenic brain abscess  a 15 year survey. Brain abscess is a potentially fatal disease. This study assesses clinical aspects of brain abscess in a large hospital cohort. Retrospective review of adult patients with pyogenic brain abscess at Rigshospitalet University Hospital  Denmark between 1994 and 2009. Prognostic factors associated with Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) (death  severe disability or vegetative state) were assessed by logistic regression. 102 patients were included. On admission  only 20% of patients had a triad of fever  headache and nausea  39% had no fever  26% had normal CRP and 49% had no leucocytosis. Median delay from symptom onset to antibiotic treatment was 7 days (range 0-97 days). Source of infection was contiguous in 36%  haematogenous in 28%  surgical or traumatic in 9% and unknown in 27% of cases. Abscess location did not accurately predict the portal of entry. 67% were treated by burr hole aspiration  20% by craniotomy and 13% by antibiotics alone. Median duration of antibiotic treatment was 62 days. No cases of recurrent abscess were observed. At discharge 23% had GOS ≤3. The 1-  3- and 12-month mortality was 11%  17% and 19%. Adverse outcome was associated with a low GCS at admission  presence of comorbidities and intraventricular rupture of abscess. The clinical signs of brain abscess are unspecific  many patients presented without clear signs of infection and diagnosis and treatment were often delayed. Decreased GCS  presence of comorbidities and intraventricular rupture of brain abscess were associated with poor outcome. Brain abscess remains associated with considerable morbidity and mortality.
Pharmacoepidemiology,,,Antiepileptic drugs and risk of suicide: a nationwide study. Patients with epilepsy or psychiatric diseases have increased risk of suicide  but whether the risk is influenced by antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment is unclear. Studies have suggested that AEDs in general increase the risk of suicidal behaviour shortly after initiation. This study investigated possible differences in suicide risk associated with different AEDs. The use of AEDs in the Danish population from 1997 to 2006 was determined by prescription claims. The risk of suicide associated with use of AEDs was estimated by case-crossover analyses  where each case serves at its own control during different periods. For sensitivity  the risk of suicide was estimated by a time-dependent Cox proportional-hazard analysis in AED treatment-naïve patients. There were 6780 cases committing suicide in the 10-year study period  of which 422 received AED treatment at the time of suicide. The case-crossover analysis estimated AED treatment initiation to increase the risk of suicide (odds ratio (OR): 1.84  95% confidence interval (CI): 1.36-2.49). Clonazepam (OR: 2.01  CI: 1.25-3.25)  valproate (OR: 2.08  CI: 1.04-4.16)  lamotrigine (OR: 3.15  CI: 1.35-7.34) and phenobarbital (OR: 1.96  CI: 1.02-3.75) were associated with a significant increased risk  while the remaining examined AEDs did not significantly influence the risk. In the cohort comprising of 169 725 AED treatment-naïve patients  the Cox proportional-hazard analysis yielded similar results. This study suggests that clonazepam  valproate  lamotrigine and phenobarbital relatively shortly after treatment initiation may increase the risk of suicide. The increased risk of suicide associated with these AEDs appears to be a consistent finding.
Clinical Competence,Education,Rheumatology,Feasibility of a standardized ultrasound examination in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: a quality improvement among rheumatologists cohort. Quality improvement is important to facilitate valid patient outcomes. Standardized examination procedures may improve the validity of US.The aim of this study was to investigate the learning progress for rheumatologists during training of US examination of the hand in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Rheumatologists with varying degrees of experience in US were instructed by skilled tutors. The program consisted of two days with hands-on training followed by personal US examinations performed in their individual clinics. Examinations were sent to the tutors for quality control. The US examinations were evaluated according to a scoring sheet containing 144 items. An acceptable examination was defined as > 80% correct scores. Thirteen rheumatologists participated in the study. They included a total of 104 patients with RA. Only few of the initial examinations were scored below 80%  and as experience increased  the scores improved (p = 0.0004). A few participants displayed decreasing scores.The mean time spent performing the standardized examination procedure decreased from 34 min to less than 10 minutes (p = 0.0001). With systematic hands-on training  a rheumatologist can achieve a high level of proficiency in the conduction of US examinations of the joints of the hand in patients with RA. With experience  examination time decreases  while the level of correctness is maintained. The results indicate that US may be applied as a valid measurement tool suitable for clinical practice and in both single- and multi-centre trials.
Internship and Residency,Orthopedics,,The use of computer-assisted surgery as an educational tool for the training of orthopedic surgery residents in pedicle screw placement: a pilot study and survey among orthopedic residents. The training of orthopedic residents in adequate pedicle screw placement is very important. We sought to investigate orthopedic residents' perspectives on the use of computer-assisted surgery (CAS) in a training trial. Orthopedic residents were randomly assigned to independently place a screw using the free-hand technique and the CAS technique on 1 of 3 cadavers (Cobb angles 5º  15º and 67º) at randomly selected thoracolumbar vertebral levels. All residents were blinded to their colleagues' pedicle screw placements and were asked to complete a short questionnaire at the end of the session to evaluate their experience with CAS. We obtained CT images for each cadaver to assess pedicle screw placement accuracy and classified placement as A) screw completely in pedicle  B) screw < 2 mm outside pedicle  C) screw 2-4 mm outside pedicle  or D) screw > 4 mm outside pedicle. Twenty-four orthopedic residents participated in this trial study. In total  65% preferred using the free-hand technique in an educational setting even though most (60%) said that CAS is safer. The main reason for free-hand technique preference was the difficult technical aspects encountered with CAS. In addition  accuracy of pedicle screw placement in this trial showed that 5 screws were classified as A or B (safe zone) and 19 as grade C or D (unsafe zone) using the free-hand technique compared with 15 and 9  respectively  using CAS (p = 0.008). Orthopedic residents perceived CAS as safe and demonstrated improved accuracy in pedicle screw placement in a single setting. However  the residents preferred the free-hand technique in an educational stetting owing to the difficult technical aspects of CAS. Il est très important d’apprendre aux médecins résidents en chirurgie orthopédique comment positionner adéquatement une vis pédiculaire. Notre objectif était d’obtenir l’opinion des médecins résidents sur le recours à la chirurgie assistée par ordinateur (CAO) dans un essai sur la formation. Des médecins résidents en chirurgie orthopédique répartis aléatoirement ont placé indépendamment une vis à l’aide d’une technique à main libre basée sur les repères topographiques et la palpation  et de la CAO dans 1 de 3 cadavres (angles de Cobb de 5°  15° et 67°) dans une vertèbre dorsolombaire sélectionnée aléatoirement. Aucun des médecins résidents n’a pu observer le positionnement de la vis de ses collègues  et les participants ont rempli un court questionnaire à la fin de la séance pour évaluer leur expérience de la CAO. Nous avons obtenu un tomodensitogramme pour chaque cadavre afin d’évaluer la précision du positionnement de la vis pédiculaire  classée selon 4 catégories : A) vis entièrement dans le pédicule  B) vis < 2 mm hors du pédicule  C) vis de 2–4 mm hors du pédicule  ou D) vis > 4 mm hors du pédicule. Vingt-quatre médecins résidents en chirurgie orthopédique ont participé à l’étude clinique. Au total  65 % d’entre eux ont préféré utiliser la technique à main libre dans un contexte de formation  même si la plupart (60 %) considéraient que la CAO était plus sécuritaire. La principale raison justifiant cette préférence était le degré de difficulté technique associé à la CAO. De plus  une évaluation de la précision du positionnement a montré qu’avec la technique à main libre  5 des vis posées se classaient dans les catégories A ou B (sécuritaire) et 19 dans les catégories C ou D (non sécuritaire)  alors que la CAO a permis de positionner 15 vis dans les catégories A ou B et 9 dans les catégories C ou D (p = 0 008). Chez un sous-groupe de patients souffrant de traumatismes abdominaux pénétrants  le traitement conservateur est sécuritaire et se traduit par une durée de séjour inférieure de 1 9 jour. La présence de fluide détectée par tomodensitographie est un indicateur de l'échec du traitement.
Epidemiology,,,Parkinson's disease and risk of prostate cancer: A Danish population-based case-control study  1995-2010. Prostate cancer growth and progression may be linked to neurogenesis and to medical anti- Parkinson treatment  but results are inconclusive. Therefore  we examined the association between Parkinson's disease and risk of prostate cancer in a population based case-control study. We identified 45 429 patients diagnosed with incident prostate cancer during 1997-2010 from the National Cancer Registry. Five age-matched population controls (n=227 145) were selected for each case. Odds ratios (ORs) adjusted for age and comorbidity for prostate cancer associated with Parkinson's disease were computed using conditional logistic regression. Analyses were stratified by duration of Parkinson's disease and stage of prostate cancer (localized and advanced). In total  245 patients (0 5%) and 1656 controls (0 7%) had Parkinson's disease. Overall  patients with Parkinson's disease had a 27% lower risk of prostate cancer compared with patients without Parkinson's disease (adjusted OR (ORa) 0.73; 95% confidence interval (CI)  0.63-0.83). Risk of prostate cancer decreased with increasing duration of Parkinson's disease. The odds ratios were slightly lower for advanced prostate cancer (ORa  0.68; 95% CI  0.52-0.88) than for localized prostate cancer (ORa 0.76; 95% CI  0.61-0.93). Parkinson's disease was associated with a risk reduction overall (27%)  which decreased with increasing duration of Parkinson's disease.
Epidemiology,,,Low-dose aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and prostate cancer risk: a nationwide study. Increasing evidence suggests that aspirin use may protect against prostate cancer. In a nationwide case-control study  using Danish high-quality registry data  we evaluated the association between the use of low-dose aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the risk of prostate cancer. We identified 35 600 patients (cases) with histologically verified prostate cancer during 2000-2012. Cases were matched to 177 992 population controls on age and residence by risk-set sampling. Aspirin and nonaspirin NSAID exposure was defined by type  estimated dose  duration  and consistency of use. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs)  with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs)  for prostate cancer associated with low-dose aspirin (75-150 mg) or nonaspirin NSAID use  adjusted for potential confounders. Use of low-dose aspirin was associated with an OR for prostate cancer of 0.94 (95 % CI 0.91-0.97). Slightly lower ORs were seen with increasing cumulative amount  duration  and consistency of low-dose aspirin use (continuous use  ≥5 years: OR 0.89; 95 % CI 0.82-0.97; ≥10 years: OR 0.86; 95 % CI 0.70-1.06). Nonaspirin NSAID use was associated with a slightly increased OR for prostate cancer (1.13; 95 % CI 1.10-1.15); however  this association was confined to localized disease and did not vary materially with amount  duration  or consistency of nonaspirin NSAID use. Our study indicates that long-term  consistent low-dose aspirin use may provide modest protection against prostate cancer. The slightly increased risk of only localized prostate cancer with nonaspirin NSAID use suggests a noncausal explanation of the observed association.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Treatment of psychotic depression]. Psychotic depression is frequent among hospitalized patients diagnosed with major depression. Patients diagnosed with this type of depression display a number of specific characteristics. They have a higher risk of suicidal behaviour  they have a prolonged and more severe clinical picture and subsequently they have an increased risk of relapse. Studies show that monotherapy with antidepressants is more effective than antipsychotic monotherapy. Electroconvulsive therapy remains the most effective treatment  while tricyclic antidepressants in monotherapy are also effective. An antipsychotic drug can be added if no effect of monotherapeutic antidepressant treatment is observed within two to four weeks.
Pharmacoepidemiology,,,Risk factors for venous thromboembolism during pregnancy. Pregnant women are at an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Risk factors for VTE among pregnant women are not sufficiently investigated. To examine pharmacological and non-pharmacological VTE risk factors during pregnancy (antepartum). The population comprised all pregnant women in Denmark aged 15-50 giving birth 2003-2010. Pregnancies were linked on an individual level with national registers for hospital admissions and drug dispenses from pharmacies. Risk of first occurring VTE antepartum was examined with Cox regression models. Out of 299 810 pregnancies  337 experienced a VTE  incidence rate 1.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-1.3) per 1000 pregnancies. Being underweight (body mass index [BMI] < 18.5 kg/m(2) ) was associated with a decreased risk of VTE (hazard ratio [HR] 0.53 [CI 0.29-0.98]) compared to normal weight (18.5 ≤ BMI < 25 kg/m(2) ). Overweight (25 ≤ BMI < 30 kg/m(2) ) increased VTE risk (HR 1.30 [CI 1.01-1.67]) but obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2) ) was insignificant (HR 1.14 [CI 0.82-1.58]). A history of VTE was highly significant (HR 72.65 [CI 51.17-103.15]). The youngest (<20 years) and oldest (≥35 years) had insignificantly increased risks (HR 1.45 [CI 0.80-2.62] and HR 1.31 [CI 0.98-1.75]  respectively) compared to those aged 20-30 years. Sixteen groups of medications  including anti-infectious medications  hormones  aminosalicylic acid  insulin  and benzodiazepine derivatives  were associated with VTE. The risk of antepartum VTE was increased in women with prior VTE. Compared to normal weight women  being underweight decreased the risk of VTE whereas being overweight increased the risk. Also  the use of several medications was associated with increased risk of VTE.
Epidemiology,,,Obesity is a risk factor for atrial fibrillation among fertile young women: a nationwide cohort study. Obesity has been associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF)  but whether this risk is also prevalent in younger individuals is unknown. We therefore investigated the risk of AF in relation to body mass index (BMI) among young fertile women. By cross-linkage of nationwide registers of childbirth and hospitalization  we identified 271 203 women without prior AF who gave birth in Denmark between 2004 and 2009. Body mass index (kg/m(2)) was examined as a risk factor for AF using proportional hazard models. Mean age was 30.6 years (4.7 SD) and median follow-up was 4.6 years (interquartile range 2.9-5.8). During the follow-up  110 women were hospitalized with first-time AF; very few individuals had known risk factors for AF. Overall incidence rate of AF was 9.3 [95% confidence interval (CI): 7.7-11.2] per 100 000 person-years. According to BMI  the incidence rate of AF per 100 000 person-years was 7.4 (5.6-9.7) in normal weight (BMI: 18.5-24.9)  8.5 (5.5-13.1) in overweight (BMI: 25-29.9)  15.8 (9.3-26.7) in obese (BMI: 30-35)  and 27.3 (15.5-48.1) in very obese (BMI >35) individuals. Multivariable regression analyses adjusted for age  hyperthyroidism  and previous use of beta-blockers revealed a hazard ratio of 2.04 (95% CI: 1.13-3.69) in the obese and 3.50 (1.86-6.58) in the very obese individuals compared with normal weight. Obesity is a risk factor for AF among young and essentially healthy fertile women despite the low incidence of AF. These results may have implications for prevention of AF.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Proliferation assessment in breast carcinomas using digital image analysis based on virtual Ki67/cytokeratin double staining. Manual estimation of Ki67 Proliferation Index (PI) in breast carcinoma classification is labor intensive and prone to intra- and interobserver variation. Standard Digital Image Analysis (DIA) has limitations due to issues with tumor cell identification. Recently  a computer algorithm  DIA based on Virtual Double Staining (VDS)  segmenting Ki67-positive and -negative tumor cells using digitally fused parallel cytokeratin (CK) and Ki67-stained slides has been introduced. In this study  we compare VDS with manual stereological counting of Ki67-positive and -negative cells and examine the impact of the physical distance of the parallel slides on the alignment of slides. TMAs  containing 140 cores of consecutively obtained breast carcinomas  were stained for CK and Ki67 using optimized staining protocols. By means of stereological principles  Ki67-positive and -negative cell profiles were counted in sampled areas and used for the estimation of PIs of the whole tissue core. The VDS principle was applied to both the same sampled areas and the whole tissue core. Additionally  five neighboring slides were stained for CK in order to examine the alignment algorithm. Correlation between manual counting and VDS in both sampled areas and whole core was almost perfect (correlation coefficients above 0.97). Bland-Altman plots did not reveal any skewness in any data ranges. There was a good agreement in alignment (>85 %) in neighboring slides  whereas agreement decreased in non-neighboring slides. VDS gave similar results compared with manual counting using stereological principles. Introduction of this method in clinical and research practice may improve accuracy and reproducibility of Ki67 PI.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Automated quantification of proliferation with automated hot-spot selection in phosphohistone H3/MART1 dual-stained stage I/II melanoma. Staging of melanoma includes quantification of a proliferation index  i.e.  presumed melanocytic mitoses of H&E stains are counted manually in hot spots. Yet  its reproducibility and prognostic impact increases by immunohistochemical dual staining for phosphohistone H3 (PHH3) and MART1  which also may enable fully automated quantification by image analysis. To ensure manageable workloads and repeatable measurements in modern pathology  the study aimed to present an automated quantification of proliferation with automated hot-spot selection in PHH3/MART1-stained melanomas. Formalin-fixed  paraffin-embedded tissue from 153 consecutive stage I/II melanoma patients was immunohistochemically dual-stained for PHH3 and MART1. Whole slide images were captured  and the number of PHH3/MART1-positive cells was manually and automatically counted in the global tumor area and in a manually and automatically selected hot spot  i.e.  a fixed 1-mm(2) square. Bland-Altman plots and hypothesis tests compared manual and automated procedures  and the Cox proportional hazards model established their prognostic impact. The mean difference between manual and automated global counts was 2.9 cells/mm(2) (P = 0.0071) and 0.23 cells per hot spot (P = 0.96) for automated counts in manually and automatically selected hot spots. In 77 % of cases  manual and automated hot spots overlapped. Fully manual hot-spot counts yielded the highest prognostic performance with an adjusted hazard ratio of 5.5 (95 % CI  1.3-24  P = 0.024) as opposed to 1.3 (95 % CI  0.61-2.9  P = 0.47) for automated counts with automated hot spots. The automated index and automated hot-spot selection were highly correlated to their manual counterpart  but altogether their prognostic impact was noticeably reduced. Because correct recognition of only one PHH3/MART1-positive cell seems important  extremely high sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm is required for prognostic purposes. Thus  automated analysis may still aid and improve the pathologists' detection of mitoses in melanoma and possibly other malignancies.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Tumour-associated mast cells in classical Hodgkin's lymphoma: correlation with histological subtype  other tumour-infiltrating inflammatory cell subsets and outcome. The tumour microenvironment in classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (cHL) is characterised by a minor population of neoplastic Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells within a heterogeneous background of non-neoplastic bystanders cells  including mast cells. The number of infiltrating mast cells in cHL has been reported to correlate with poor prognosis. We used immunohistochemistry to assess the degree of tumour-infiltrating mast cells in cHL tissue microarrays and correlated this with clinico-pathological features and prognosis in a cohort of homogeneously treated patients with Hodgkin's disease. A high degree of tumour mast cells was associated with nodular sclerosis (NS) subtype histology (P = 0.0002). Moreover  the number of mast cells was inversely correlated with the numbers of CD68+ and CD163+ macrophages (P = 0.0001 and P = 0.003  respectively) and with the number of granzyme+ cytotoxic cells (P = 0.004). The degree of mast cell infiltration was not a prognostic factor in cHL of nodular sclerosis subtype. In contrast  in mixed cellularity cHL a high number of intratumoral mast cells correlated with significantly poorer outcome both in terms of overall (P = 0.03) and event-free survival (P = 0.01). Further studies are warranted into the biological mechanisms underlying this adverse outcome and their possible therapeutic implications.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Automated quantification of MART1-verified Ki-67 indices: useful diagnostic aid in melanocytic lesions. The MART1-verified Ki-67 proliferation index is a valuable aid to distinguish melanomas from nevi. Because such indices are quantifiable by image analysis  they may provide a novel automated diagnostic aid. This study aimed to validate the diagnostic performance of automated dermal Ki-67 indices and to explore the diagnostic capability of epidermal Ki-67 in lesions both with and without a dermal component. In addition  we investigated the automated indices' ability to predict sentinel lymph node (SLN) status. Paraffin-embedded tissues from 84 primary cutaneous melanomas (35 with SLN biopsy)  22 melanoma in situ  and 270 nevi were included consecutively. Whole slide images were captured from Ki-67/MART1 double stains  and image analysis computed Ki-67 indices for epidermis and dermis. In lesions with a dermal component  the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI]  0.72-0.86) for dermal indices. By excluding lesions with few melanocytic cells  this area increased to 0.93 (95% CI  0.88-0.98). A simultaneous analysis of epidermis and dermis yielded an ROC area of 0.94 (95% CI  0.91-0.96) for lesions with a dermal component and 0.98 (95% CI  0.97-1.0) for lesions with a considerable dermal component. For all lesions  the ROC area of the simultaneous analysis was 0.89 (95% CI  0.85-0.92). SLN-positive patients generally had a higher index than SLN-negative patients (P ≤ .003). Conclusively  an automated diagnostic aid seems feasible in melanocytic pathology. The dermal Ki-67 index was inferior to a combined epidermal and dermal index in diagnosis but valuable for predicting the SLN status of our melanoma patients.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Immunohistochemical analysis of molecular drivers in melanoma identifies p16 as an independent prognostic biomarker. To perform immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of molecular drivers related to the development and maintenance of melanoma and to assess their value as diagnostic and prognostic melanoma biomarkers in routine clinical practice. Tissue microarrays constructed from a cohort of primary melanomas (n=355)  benign naevi (n=37) and melanoma metastases (n=14) were evaluated for IHC expression of c-KIT  BRAF(V600E)  MITF  p16  p53 and PTEN  as well as for pERK  a surrogate marker for mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation. The results were correlated with clinicopathological parameters and clinical outcome. Absent p16 expression and reduced MITF expression were both associated with the adverse prognostic markers ulceration (p=0.009 and p<0.0001  respectively)  advanced tumour stage (p<0.0001 and p=0.001  respectively) and higher Breslow thickness (both p<0.0001)  as well as with an adverse overall relapse-free survival (p<0.0001 and p=0.003  respectively). Absence of p16 expression predicted overall relapse-free (p=0.02) and distant metastasis-free (p=0.04) survival  independently of Breslow thickness  ulceration and tumour stage. IHC determined p16 expression is an independent prognostic biomarker of potential value in routine melanoma diagnostic practice.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Proliferation indices of phosphohistone H3 and Ki67: strong prognostic markers in a consecutive cohort with stage I/II melanoma. Cellular proliferation is correlated with the progression of melanoma. Accordingly  the proliferation index of H&E-stained thin melanomas was recently included in the staging system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Yet  the immunohistochemical markers of proliferation phosphohistone H3 and Ki67 may improve such indices. To accurately quantify these markers  they should be combined with a melanocytic marker  for example  MART1 in an immunohistochemical double stain; also enabling automated quantification by image analysis. The aim of the study was to compare the prognostic impact of phosphohistone H3/MART1  Ki67/MART1  and H&E stains in primary cutaneous melanoma  and to determine the difference between indices established in hot spots and the global tumor areas. The study included 153 consecutive stage I/II melanoma-patients. The follow-up time was 8-14 years for event-free melanoma. Recurrent disease occurred in 43 patients; 37 died of melanoma. Both events occurred in only three thin melanomas. Their paraffin-embedded tissue was stained for phosphohistone H3/MART1  Ki67/MART1  and with H&E. And proliferation indices were established in 1-mm(2) hot spots and in the global tumor areas. In multivariate Cox analyses  only hot spot indices of phosphohistone H3/MART1 and Ki67/MART1 were independent prognostic markers. Phosphohistone H3/MART1 tended to be better than Ki67/MART1 with adjusted hazard ratios of 3.66 (95% CI  1.40-9.55; P=0.008) for progression-free survival and 3.42 (95% CI  1.29-9.04; P=0.013) for melanoma-specific death. In all stains  prognostic performance was substantially improved by using hot spots instead of the global tumor areas. In conclusion  phosphohistone H3/MART1 and Ki67/MART1 were superior to H&E stains  and hot spots superior to the global tumor areas. Given the potential for automated analysis  these double stains seem to be robust alternatives to conventional mitotic detection by H&E in stage I/II melanomas in general. This was particularly true for thick melanomas whereas no specific analyses for thin melanomas only could be performed.
Immunohistochemistry,,,Automated quantification of MART1-verified Ki67 indices by digital image analysis in melanocytic lesions. The proliferation marker Ki67 is an important diagnostic and prognostic aid in surgical pathology. However  manual quantification in a counting frame to accurately establish the proliferation rate (Ki67 index) is cumbersome and time-consuming. Instead  digital image analysis of Ki67/MART1 double stains may provide fast and novel index computations for entire tumor sections. To design and compare image analysis protocols that compute Ki67 indices of Ki67/MART1 double stains  to compare automated indices with previously published manual indices  and to compare the total number of proliferating cells (mimicking a Ki67 single stain) with the number of MART1-verified proliferating cells. Whole slide images were captured from 48 melanomas and 77 nevi stained with an immunohistochemical cocktail against Ki67 and MART1. Ki67 indices were determined by digital image analysis and different equations based on number or area. The differences between mean indices of melanomas and nevi were significant (P < .001) in all index computations. Number-based image analysis of lesions with more than 250 melanocytic cells misclassified 1 of 42 melanomas and 4 of 53 nevi  numbers comparable with manual counting. Automated indices were significantly higher than manual indices  as were indices of mimicked Ki67 single stains compared with MART1-verified Ki67 indices (P < .001). Ki67 indices established by digital image analysis of Ki67/MART1 double stains demonstrated excellent abilities to discriminate melanomas from nevi with diagnostic performances equal to manually performed indices. Testing different definitions of the automated MART1-verified Ki67 index  no single definition stood out; thus  a variety of definitions may be used.
Microscopy,,,Digital image analysis: a review of reproducibility  stability and basic requirements for optimal results. Digital image analysis (DIA) is increasingly implemented in histopathological research to facilitate truly quantitative measurements  decrease inter-observer variation and reduce hands-on time. Originally  efforts were made to enable DIA to reproduce manually obtained results on histological slides optimized for light microscopy and the human eye. With improved technical methods and the acknowledgement that computerized readings are different from analysis by human eye  recognition has been achieved that to really empower DIA  histological slides must be optimized for the digital 'eye'  with reproducible results correlating with clinical findings. In this review  we focus on the basic expectations and requirements for DIA to gain wider use in histopathological research and diagnostics. With a reference to studies that specifically compare DIA with conventional methods  this review discusses reproducibility  application of stereology-based quantitative measurements  time consumption  optimization of histological slides  regions of interest selection and recent developments in staining and imaging techniques.
Rehabilitation,,,Predictors of improvement in observed functional ability in patients with fibromyalgia as an outcome of rehabilitation. To investigate predictors of improvement in observed ability to manage activities of daily living as an outcome of rehabilitation in fibromyalgia. Exploratory analyses used data from the Interdisciplinary Rehabilitation and Evaluation Programme for Patients with Chronic Widespread Pain (the IMPROvE study); a randomized controlled trial including 191 females with fibromyalgia randomized (1:1) to rehabilitation or a waiting list. The primary outcome was observed activities of daily living ability evaluated with the Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS) 6 months post-intervention. Overall  38.7% of subjects were AMPS responders  i.e. having a clinically meaningful improvement in AMPS activities of daily living ability measures at 6 months post-intervention. In the exploratory analysis  only 4 baseline variables out of the 52 analysed showed a statistically significant interaction with treatment allocation (at the 0.05 level) indicating possible predictive value. Statistical analyses that used continuous variables dichotomized at the median suggested a predictive value of a low intake of weak and strong analgesics  and a high score of current pain and total score on the Pain Detect Questionnaire. The results of this exploratory study suggest that several subgroups of patients  specifically those with a low baseline intake of weak and strong analgesics  and more pronounced clinical signs of central sensitization  may gain most clinical benefit from specialized rehabilitation when the outcome of interest is improvement in observed activity of daily living ability.
Research Design,,,Most Trial Eligibility Criteria and Patient Baseline Characteristics Do Not Modify Treatment Effect in Trials Using Targeted Therapies for Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Meta-Epidemiological Study. To determine if variations in trial eligibility criteria and patient baseline characteristics could be considered effect modifiers of the treatment response when testing targeted therapies (biological agents and targeted synthetic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)) for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We conducted a meta-epidemiological study of all trials evaluating a targeted therapy approved by regulatory authorities for treating RA. The database search was completed on December 11th 2013. Eligible trials reported ACR20 data at months 3-6 and used an add-on design. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated from the response rates and compared among the trial eligibility criteria/patient baseline characteristics of interest. Comparisons are presented as the Ratio of Odds Ratios (ROR). Sixty-two trials (19 923 RA patients) were included in the primary analyses using ACR20 response. Overall  targeted therapies constituted an effective treatment (OR 3.96 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.41 to 4.60). The majority of the trial eligibility criteria and patient baseline characteristics did not modify treatment effect. The added benefit of targeted therapies was lower in trials including "DMARD-naïve" patients compared with trials including "DMARD inadequate responders" (ROR = 0.45  95%CI 0.31 to 0.66) and trials including "targeted therapy inadequate responders" (0.50  95%CI 0.29 to 0.87)  test for interaction: p = 0.0002. Longer mean disease duration was associated with a higher likelihood of responding to treatment (β = 1.05  95%CI 1.00 to 1.11 OR's per year; p = 0.03). Analyses conducted using DAS28-remission as the outcome supported the above-mentioned findings. Our results suggest that a highly selective inclusion is not associated with greater treatment effect  as might otherwise be expected. The added benefit of a targeted therapy was lower in trials including patients who were DMARD-naïve and trials including patients with shorter disease durations.
Rehabilitation,,,Association of Physical Fitness With Fibromyalgia Severity in Women: The al-Ándalus Project. To assess the association between physical fitness and fibromyalgia (FM) severity in women with FM as well as to assess whether different fitness components present an independent relation with FM severity. Population-based cross-sectional study. University facilities and FM associations. Women with FM (N=444). Not applicable. FM severity was assessed with the Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQR). Aerobic fitness (6-min walk test)  muscle strength (handgrip  chair stand  and arm curl tests)  flexibility (chair sit and reach and back scratch tests)  and motor agility (8 foot Up and Go test) were measured with the Senior Fitness Test battery and digital dynamometry. A standardized composite score (hereafter "global fitness profile") was calculated and divided into quintiles. Overall  physical fitness was significantly associated with the FIQR total and subscale scores  regardless of the fitness test used (all P<.05). The 6-minute walk and back-scratch tests were independently associated with the FIQR total score (R(2)=.88; both P<.005). The group with the highest global fitness profile had 16% lower FM severity than did the group with the lowest global fitness profile (P<.001). Our results suggest that higher physical fitness is consistently associated with lower FM severity in women with FM. Aerobic fitness and flexibility present independent associations with FM severity. However  the FIQR variability explained by these fitness tests was rather low (<10%)  and further research on the potential disagreement between performance-based physical fitness and different self-reported outcomes in women with FM is warranted.
Education,,,Determinants of vitamin D status in young adults: influence of lifestyle  sociodemographic and anthropometric factors. Very few studies have investigated the determinants of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) in young adults (18-25 years old) using a set of variables that include lifestyle  sociodemographic  and anthropometric data. Our aim was to investigate the association between these variables and vitamin D status in a sample of untreated young adults. A total of 738 young adults were enrolled in a (June cross-sectional study 2012 to May 2014) and were recruited from educational institutions in the Copenhagen area. For multivariate logistic regression subjects was categorized based on 25[OH]D in serum into; vitamin D sufficiency (S-25[OH]D > 50 nmol/L)  vitamin D insufficiency (25 nmol/L ≤ S-25[OH]D ≤ 50 nmol/L)  vitamin D deficiency (S-25[OH]D < 25 nmol/L). Information on lifestyle factors and education was obtained by self-reported questionnaires. 700 subjects with a valid measurement of S-25[OH]D and a completed questionnaire was analysed. 238 had vitamin D insufficiency  135 had vitamin D deficiency of which 13 had severe vitamin D deficiency (S-25[OH]D < 12.5 nmol/L). The relative risk (RR) for vitamin D deficiency was highest for men 2.09 (1.52  2.87); obese subjects 2.00 (1.27  3.15); smokers 1.33 (1.02  1.73); subjects who exercised 0-½ hours a week 1.88 (1.21  2.94); and subjects who consumed fast food once a week 1.59 (1.05  2.43). The relative risk was significantly lower for subjects who were studying for a Bachelor's degree (0.40 (0.23  0.68). For vitamin D insufficiency  the highest RR was again for men 1.31 (1.06  1.61); obese subjects 1.57 (1.17  2.11); and subjects who exercised 0-½ hours a week 1.51 (1.11  2.06). In this study of young adults  vitamin D deficiency was highly prevalent. Modifiable factors such as smoking  maintenance of normal BMI  and physical activity are all potential targets for interventional trials to determine the causal order; such knowledge would be useful in improving S-25[OH]D in young adults. The small group with severe vitamin D deficiency warrants increased attention.
Proteomics,,,Urinary proteomics for early diagnosis in diabetic nephropathy. Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a progressive kidney disease  a well-known complication of long-standing diabetes. DN is the most frequent reason for dialysis in many Western countries. Early detection may enable development of specific drugs and early initiation of therapy  thereby postponing/preventing the need for renal replacement therapy. We evaluated urinary proteome analysis as a tool for prediction of DN. Capillary electrophoresis-coupled mass spectrometry was used to profile the low-molecular weight proteome in urine. We examined urine samples from a longitudinal cohort of type 1 and 2 diabetic patients (n = 35) using a previously generated chronic kidney disease (CKD) biomarker classifier to assess peptides of collected urines for signs of DN. The application of this classifier to samples of normoalbuminuric subjects up to 5 years prior to development of macroalbuminuria enabled early detection of subsequent progression to macroalbuminuria (area under the curve [AUC] 0.93) compared with urinary albumin routinely used to determine the diagnosis (AUC 0.67). Statistical analysis of each urinary CKD biomarker depicted its regulation with respect to diagnosis of DN over time. Collagen fragments were prominent biomarkers 3-5 years before onset of macroalbuminuria. Before albumin excretion starts to increase  there is a decrease in collagen fragments. Urinary proteomics enables noninvasive assessment of DN risk at an early stage via determination of specific collagen fragments.
Occupational Therapy,,,Describing patients with a duration of sick leave over and under one year in Norway. This study aimed to describe the somatic  social  psychological  and work-related factors that characterize participants with a duration of sick leave over and under one year. During 2012  181 patients on long-term sick leave were consecutively recruited and asked to answer an extensive survey. Several outcomes were reported  addressing work-related factors and somatic  psychological  and social symptoms. In cross-sectional analyses  sick leave duration was dichotomized as > or < one year  based on Norwegian legislation. Linear and logistic regressions were used to estimate population probabilities and means. The estimated prevalence of pain  fatigue  anxiety  and depression was overall high. There was a tendency towards a higher prevalence of fatigue  anxiety  and depression in those with sick leave duration less than one year  with the exception of sleep problems  which was more frequent in the population with longer duration. Relationship with friends  family  co-workers  and the last workplace were worse in the population with longer duration. Cross-sectional analyses indicated that social and work-related problems are more adverse in patients with longer duration of sick leave  while psychological and somatic symptoms appear less adverse. This is one of the first studies quantitatively demonstrating these differences through comprehensive  simultaneously measured self-report questionnaires.
Clinical Competence,,,[The effect of fasting on the surgical skills of surgeons]. There have been worries of a potential negative effect of the fasting practice on surgeon's skills. We set out to examine the effect of fasting for a single surgeon during the fast and after the fast was broken. We examined the skills of the surgeon in a previously developed model for training in laparoscopic surgery. Foetor ex ore was also examined during and after the fast. Fasting did not affect the surgical skills  but resulted in increased foetor ex ore. Abstaining from eating and drinking during the daytime does probably not negatively affect surgical skills  but increases foetor ex ore.
