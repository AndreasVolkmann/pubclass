Epidemiology,,,Epidemiological study of paediatric germ cell tumours revealed the incidence and distribution that was expected  but a low mortality rate. Germ cell tumours (GCTs) are a rare heterogeneous tumour group derived from primordial germ cells  which can be benign or malignant and occur in the gonads or extragonadally. This study mapped the paediatric GCTs in Denmark from 1984 to 2013 to study the incidence and outcome. We identified paediatric GCTs from the Danish Childhood Cancer and National Pathology Registries and reviewed the case records for patient characteristics  tumour characteristics and clinical outcome. We identified 403 (71% female) paediatric GCTs and the crude incidence was 1.43 per 100 000. Of these  79 (20%) were malignant  39 (10%) were potentially malignant and 285 (70%) were benign. Extragonadal GCTs (39%) were mainly observed in early childhood and were predominately sacrococcygeal teratomas. Gonadal GCTs (61%) in late childhood were most frequently mature teratomas in the ovaries. Nearly all patients underwent surgery. Of the malignant tumours  62% were treated with chemotherapy. Radiotherapy was only administered to intracranial GCTs. In the cohort  12 patients died (3%). Paediatric GCTs in Denmark were mainly benign and mortality was low  even for malignant tumours. We identified a peak of extragonadal GCTs in early childhood and a peak of gonadal GCTs in late childhood  which was comparable to previous reports.
Pediatrics,,,Symptoms and time to diagnosis in children with brain tumours. Clinical symptoms in brain tumours in children are variable at onset and diagnosis is often delayed. Symptoms were investigated with regard to brain tumour localisation  prediagnostic symptomatic intervals and malignancy. Clinical data from children aged 0-17 years from Southern Denmark were analysed retrospectively and the results were correlated with data on prehospital symptoms obtained from interviews with parents and general practitioners. A total of 55 children diagnosed during a period of five years were indentified and 31 interviews were obtained. A total of 19 (41%) of the tumours were supratentorial hemispheric and midline and 27 (59%) were infratentorial. At supratentorial localisations  42% experienced vomiting as their first symptom followed by seizures in 37% and headache in 31%. At infratentorial localisations  headache occurred in 62%  vomiting in 55% and ataxia in 48% of the cases. The prediagnostic symptomatic interval had a median duration of 30 days with vomiting (range 3-330 days)  a median of 75 days with headache (5-730 days) and a median of 75 days with ataxia (1-730 days). Diagnosis is often late in relation to the presenting symptoms. An earlier diagnosis may be achieved if a brain tumour is considered as soon as any child presents with the relevant symptoms.

Pathology  Molecular,,,Cystic and necrotic papillary renal cell carcinoma: prognosis  morphology  immunohistochemical  and molecular-genetic profile of 10 cases. Conflicting data have been published on the prognostic significance of tumor necrosis in papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC). Although the presence of necrosis is generally considered an adverse prognostic feature in PRCC  we report a cohort of 10 morphologically distinct cystic and extensively necrotic PRCC with favorable biological behavior. Ten cases of type 1 PRCC with a uniform morphologic pattern were selected from the 19 500 renal tumors  of which 1311 were PRCCs in our registry. We focused on precise morphologic diagnosis supported by immunohistochemical and molecular-genetic analysis. Patients included 8 men and 2 women with an age range of 32-85 years (mean  62.6 years). Tumor size ranged from 6 to 14 cm (mean  9.4 cm). Follow-up data were available in 7 patients  ranging from 0.5 to 14 years (mean  4 years). All tumors were spherical  cystic  and circumscribed by a thick fibrous capsule  filled with hemorrhagic/necrotic contents. Limited viable neoplastic tissue was present only as a thin rim in the inner surface of the cyst wall  consistent with type 1 PRCC. All cases were positive for AMACR  OSCAR  CAM 5.2  HIF-2  and vimentin. Chromosome 7 and 17 polysomy was found in 5 of 9 analyzable cases  2 cases demonstrated chromosome 7 and 17 disomy  and 1 case showed only chromosome 17 polysomy. Loss of chromosome Y was found in 5 cases  including 1 case with disomic chromosomes 7 and 17. No VHL gene abnormalities were found. Papillary renal cell carcinoma type 1 can present as a large hemorrhagic/necrotic unicystic lesion with a thick fibroleiomyomatous capsule. Most cases showed a chromosomal numerical aberration pattern characteristic of PRCC. All tumors followed a nonaggressive clinical course. Large liquefactive necrosis should not necessarily be considered an adverse prognostic feature  particularly in a subset of type 1 PRCC with unilocular cysts filled with necrotic/hemorrhagic material.
Pharmacology  Clinical,Specialization,,Characteristics and apprehensions of clinical pharmacologists in Swedish healthcare--a questionnaire study. To describe the discipline clinical pharmacology of today in the Swedish healthcare system from the performers' point of view. A questionnaire was administered in December 2012 to physicians working within the specialty clinical pharmacology in the Swedish healthcare system (7 sites; 1-26 physicians per site). The questionnaire included questions pertaining to the characteristics of the responder and statements to which the responder indicated his/her level of agreement using a score ranging from 1 (total disagreement) to 5 (total agreement). A total of 61 completed questionnaires were returned (response rate: 97 %; 55 % male; 74 % specialists and/or consultants). In the preceding month  79 % of the responders had performed educational activities  74 % had functioned as an "expert"  and 75 % had performed research. The academic merits of the responders were high  with 72 % having at least a PhD degree and 23 % being professors. Among those performing research  the focus of 83 % was related to the field of clinical pharmacology  with the main sub-areas being pharmacoepidemiology (59 %) and/or pharmacogenetics (41 %). Regarding the apprehension questions  the responders strongly agreed that the specialty clinical pharmacology meets a need in the healthcare system (4.5 ± 0.7)  that they wanted to continue to work within the specialty (4.5 ± 0.7)  that their personal professional prospects were good (3.9 ± 1.0)  and that they would recommend a colleague to specialize within the field (3.9 ± 1.1). The responders from the largest and first established site (Karolinska University Hospital) agreed with these points to a significantly greater extent than responders from other sites. The majority of the performers of clinical pharmacology in Swedish healthcare consider this specialty to be important to the medical community. By carrying out educational activities  providing expertise  and performing research  the performers seem to be content with their work and future prospects. Performers within the largest and oldest site in Sweden  generally held the most positive view of the specialty.
Allergy and Immunology,,,Direct and competitive kinetic analysis of the interaction between human IgG1 and a one domain analogue of protein A. Direct and competitive kinetic analysis of the binding between a one domain analogue of protein A  and mutants thereof  to immobilised hIgG1 was compared using a biosensor system based on surface plasmon resonance detection. Rate constants determined from both assays were almost identical. The experiments demonstrate that competitive kinetic analysis can be used in combination with biosensor technology  and indicate that competitive kinetic analysis may extend the use of the technology to include low molecular weight analytes.
Ecotoxicology,,,Limited recovery of soil microbial activity after transient exposure to gasoline vapors. During gasoline spills complex mixtures of toxic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are released to terrestrial environments. Gasoline VOCs exert baseline toxicity (narcosis) and may thus broadly affect soil biota. We assessed the functional resilience (i.e. resistance and recovery of microbial functions) in soil microbial communities transiently exposed to gasoline vapors by passive dosing via headspace for 40 days followed by a recovery phase of 84 days. Chemical exposure was characterized with GC-MS  whereas microbial activity was monitored as soil respiration (CO2 release) and soil bacterial growth ([(3)H]leucine incorporation). Microbial activity was strongly stimulated and inhibited at low and high exposure levels  respectively. Microbial growth efficiency decreased with increasing exposure  but rebounded during the recovery phase for low-dose treatments. Although benzene  toluene  ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) concentrations decreased by 83-97% during the recovery phase  microbial activity in high-dose treatments did not recover and numbers of viable bacteria were 3-4 orders of magnitude lower than in control soil. Re-inoculation with active soil microorganisms failed to restore microbial activity indicating residual soil toxicity  which could not be attributed to BTEX  but rather to mixture toxicity of more persistent gasoline constituents or degradation products. Our results indicate a limited potential for functional recovery of soil microbial communities after transient exposure to high  but environmentally relevant  levels of gasoline VOCs which therefore may compromise ecosystem services provided by microorganisms even after extensive soil VOC dissipation.
Epidemiology,,,Varicella in Europe-A review of the epidemiology and experience with vaccination. There is no consensus as regards the European varicella immunisation policy; some countries have introduced varicella vaccination in their routine childhood immunisation programs whereas others have decided against or are debating. With the aim of providing an overview of the epidemiology of varicella in Europe and addressing the different strategies and the experiences so far  we performed a review of epidemiological studies done in Europe from 2004 to 2014. Varicella is mainly a disease of childhood  but sero-epidemiological studies show regional differences in the proportion of susceptible adults. Hospitalisation due to varicella is not common  but complications and hospitalisation mainly affect previously healthy children  which underlines the importance of not dismissing varicella as a disease of little importance. The experience with universal vaccination in Europe shows that vaccination leads to a rapid reduction of disease incidence. Vaccine effectiveness is high and a protective herd effect is obtained. Experience with vaccination in Europe has not been long enough  though  to draw conclusions on benefits and drawbacks with vaccination as well as the capacity for national programs in Europe to maintain a sufficiently high coverage to prevent a change in age group distribution to older children and young adults or on the impact that varicella immunisation may have on the epidemiology of shingles.
Pediatrics,,,Implementing video cases in clinical paediatric teaching increases medical students' self-assessed confidence. Use of video cases in clinical education is rarely used systematically. Medical students (n = 127) reported by questionnaire whether they had or had not seen a bedside case of each of 22 specific clinical conditions during their five-week clinical course in paediatrics in seven centres. A video case library showing children with common clinical conditions was established  and a short video was added to the oral examination. We evaluated students' and internal and external examiners' perceptions by questionnaires. A total of 81% of the students reported having seen a child with asthma in the daily clinic. In contrast  respiratory syncytial virus infection was only seen by 20%. Students' self-reported confidence in the assessment of paediatric patients increased after the video case library was made available: Before the intervention  41% (57/138) of the students reported confidence at a score of 5-7 on a seven-point Likert scale. This increased to 64% (186/289) (p < 0.0001) after the introduction of the video case library. Before  84% (116/138) of the students judged the impact of video cases to be high (score 5-7 on a seven-point Likert scale) and after the intervention  this share was 75% (218/289) (p = 0.06). Furthermore  internal as well as external examiners found video cases valuable  but the use of videos did not change the average examination grade. A video case supplement to teaching in clinical paediatrics was considered to be of value for teaching. We were successful in establishing an educational resource that students considered useful. Internal and external examiners found that a short video case was a valuable supplementary tool during the oral examination. The University of Copenhagen funded the study. not relevant.
Telemedicine,,,E-health empowers patients with ulcerative colitis: a randomised controlled trial of the web-guided 'Constant-care' approach. The natural history of ulcerative colitis requires continuous monitoring of medical treatment via frequent outpatient visits. The European health authorities' focus on e-health is increasing. Lack of easy access to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) clinics  patients' education and understanding of the importance of early treatment at relapse is leading to poor compliance. To overcome these limitations a randomised control trial 'Constant-care' was undertaken in Denmark and Ireland. 333 patients with mild/moderate ulcerative colitis and 5-aminosalicylate acid treatment were randomised to either a web-group receiving disease specific education and self-treatment via http://www.constant-care.dk or a control group continuing the usual care for 12 months. A historical control group was included to test the comparability with the control group. We investigated: feasibility of the approach  its influence on patients' compliance  knowledge  quality of life (QoL)  disease outcomes  safety and health care costs. 88% of the web patients preferred using the new approach. Adherence to 4 weeks of acute treatment was increased by 31% in Denmark and 44% in Ireland compared to the control groups. In Denmark IBD knowledge and QoL were significantly improved in web patients. Median relapse duration was 18 days (95% CI 10 to 21) in the web versus 77 days (95% CI 46 to 108) in the control group. The number of acute and routine visits to the outpatient clinic was lower in the web than in the control group  resulting in a saving of 189 euro/patient/year. No difference in the relapse frequency  hospitalisation  surgery or adverse events was observed. The historical control group was comparable with the control group. The new web-guided approach on http://www.constant-care.dk is feasible  safe and cost effective. It empowers patients with ulcerative colitis without increasing their morbidity and depression. It has yet to be shown whether this strategy can change the natural disease course of ulcerative colitis in the long term.
Evidence-Based Dentistry,,,Treatment of adult patients with partial edentulism: a systematic review. The purpose of this systematic review was to identify and critically appraise published studies of treatment methods used in general practice to rehabilitate adult patients with single tooth loss or partial edentulism  with special emphasis on outcomes reported after at least 5 years of follow-up. Three databases were searched using specified indexing terms. Publications were included if the study design  research questions  and sample size satisfied pre-established criteria. Reference lists of relevant publications and systematic reviews were also searched. The quality of evidence was classified according to the GRADE system as high  moderate  low  or very low. The search yielded 7 675 titles  of which 1 130 were read in full text. A final total of 15 publications were deemed eligible for inclusion: 5 of moderate quality and 10 of low quality. The five studies of moderate quality were all related to implant-based treatment. The 5-year survival rates for implant-supported single crowns and prostheses were 91% and 94.7%  respectively (implant survival rates: 98.5% and 94.9%  respectively). The underlying scientific evidence was low in quality. No relevant publications were identified regarding the economic aspects of treatment. Due to the low scientific evidence of the included studies  it was not possible to compare various treatment methods used for rehabilitation of single tooth loss or partial edentulism.
Evidence-Based Dentistry,,,Treatment of adult patients with edentulous arches: a systematic review. This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of treatment methods used to rehabilitate adult patients with maxillary and/or mandibular edentulism after at least 5 years of follow-up. The risks  adverse effects  and cost effectiveness of these methods were also evaluated. Three databases as well as the reference lists of included publications were searched using specified indexing terms. Publications that met the inclusion criteria were read and interpreted using pre-established protocols. Quality of evidence was classified according to the GRADE system (high  moderate  low  or very low). The search yielded 2 130 titles and abstracts. Of these  the full-text versions of 488 publications were obtained. After data extraction and interpretation  10 studies with moderate study quality of evidence and 1 study with low quality of evidence regarding outcomes  risks  and adverse effects remained. Three studies on the economic aspects of treatment were also included (1 with moderate quality and 2 with low quality). Low-quality evidence showed that the survival rate of implant-supported fixed prostheses is 95% after 5 years in patients with maxillary edentulism and 97% after 10 years in patients with mandibular edentulism. The survival rate of implant-supported overdentures is 93% after 5 years (low-quality evidence). In implant-supported fixed prostheses  70 of every 1 000 implants are at risk of failing in the maxilla after 5 years and 17 of every 1 000 implants in the mandible are at risk after 10 years. Regarding economic aspects  the evidence was insufficient to provide reliable results. Due to the low quality of evidence found in the included studies  further research with a higher quality of evidence is recommended to better understand the outcomes of treatment for patients with maxillary and/or mandibular edentulism.
Dental Research,,,A study on variances in multivariate analyses of oral implant outcome. Elaborate studies have shown that interdependency exists between implants being placed in the same patient/jaw. Therefore  interdependency ought to be an important aspect to address  whenever performing statistical analyses of oral implant outcomes. A Jackknife method could be an option when conducting statistical evaluations of oral implant failure prognoses. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a statistical difference can be detected by using the Jackknife method in conjunction with life table analyses and/or a log rank test of four different combinations of jaw density and quantity. Four multicenter studies were pooled and adjusted in order to create a research database consisting of 486 patients and 1 737 implants in preparation for the Jackknife resampling method. Combinations of jaw shapes and bone qualities were constructed to select at-risk patients. Life tables with confidence intervals were calculated and a log rank test was used to determine whether a statistical difference between the combinations could be established. Both statistical analyses  after the Jackknife resampling method  showed that patients with poor bone quality and resorbed jaws (combination IV) had a statistically higher risk of implant failure. By rearranging data using the Jackknife method  standardized statistical tests seem to work well even when the study population tested was affected by interdependency.
Epidemiology,,,Weight change and risk of hyperglycaemia in elderly women. Hyperglycaemia increases the risk of type 2 diabetes  heart disease and stroke  and is influenced by weight. However  the impact of preceding weight change on blood glycemia levels in late-life is less well understood. We studied the interplay between weight change and risk of hyperglycaemia in a prospective cohort of elderly women. Elderly Caucasian women (age: 67.1 years at baseline  n = 1173) enrolled in the Prospective Epidemiological Risk Factor study with baseline and 13-year follow-up measurements of BMI and fasting glucose levels (FPG) and no previous history of diabetes or impaired fasting glucose. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine risk of hyperglycaemia (FPG ≥ 5.6 mmol/L or HbA1c ≥ 42 mmol/mol) in normalweight (BMI ≤ 25 kg/m(2))  overweight (BMI = 25-29.9 kg/m(2)) and obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2)) women who either lost weight  were weight-stable or had gained weight at follow-up. Overweight and obese elderly women who had gained weight at follow-up presented an increased risk of hyperglycaemia  OR = 2.7 (1.6-4.6) and OR = 3.2 (1.5-6.8)  compared to weight-stable normalweight women. Overweight and obese women who lost weight decreased their risk of hyperglycaemia to a level comparable to weight-stable normalweight women. Overweight and obese women with stable weight presented a two-fold increased risk of hyperglycaemia compared to normalweight weight-stable women. Losing weight in late life had a positive effect on the risk of hyperglycaemia in overweight and obese women  while further  weight gain increased the risk of hyperglycaemia. The study highlights that strategies to reduce weight in obese and overweight elderly women could have a positive influence on disease burden in late-life.
Family Practice,,,A cluster randomized trial in general practice with referral to a group-based or an Internet-based smoking cessation programme. Reviews state that there is a room for improvements of smoking cessation (SC) intervention in general practice. In 2005  all 61 general practitioners (GPs) in four municipalities in Copenhagen  Denmark  were invited to participate. Twenty-four GPs accepted and were cluster randomized to one of three groups: Group A  referral to group-based SC counselling (national model)  n = 10; Group B  referral to internet-based SC programme (newly developed)  n = 8; or Group C  no referral ('do as usual')  n = 6. A total of 1518/1914 smokers were included  and 760 returned a questionnaire at 1-year follow-up. The participating GPs reported significantly more SC counselling than GPs who refused participation (P = 0.04). Self-reported point abstinence was 6.7% (40/600)  5.9% (28/476) and 5.7% (25/442) in Groups A  B and C  respectively. Only 40 smokers attended group-based SC counselling  and 75 logged in at the internet-based SC programme. In cluster analyses  we found no significant additional effect of referral to group-based (OR: 1.05; 95% CI: 0.6-1.8) or internet-based SC programmes (OR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.6-1.4). We found no additional effect on cessation rates of GPs' referring to group-based SC counselling or internet-based SC programme. This finding might  to some degree  be explained by the short time used by the GPs on SC counselling and the selection of the participating doctors.
Anesthesiology,,,Anaesthetist-provided pre-hospital advanced airway management in children: a descriptive study. Pre-hospital advanced airway management has been named one of the top-five research priorities in physician-provided pre-hospital critical care. Few studies have been made on paediatric pre-hospital advanced airway management. The aim of this study was to investigate pre-hospital endotracheal intubation success rate in children  first-pass success rates and complications related to pre-hospital advanced airway management in patients younger than 16 years of age treated by pre-hospital critical care teams in the Central Denmark Region (1.3 million inhabitants). A prospective descriptive study based on data collected from eight anaesthetist-staffed pre-hospital critical care teams between February 1st 2011 and November 1st 2012. Primary endpoints were 1) pre-hospital endotracheal intubation success rate in children 2) pre-hospital endotracheal intubation first-pass success rate in children and 3) complications related to prehospital advanced airway management in children. The pre-hospital critical care anaesthetists attempted endotracheal intubation in 25 children  13 of which were less than 2 years old. In one patient  a neonate (600 g birth weight)  endotracheal intubation failed. The patient was managed by uneventful bag-mask ventilation. All other 24 children had their tracheas successfully intubated by the pre-hospital critical care anaesthetists resulting in a pre-hospital endotracheal intubation success rate of 96 %. Overall first pass success-rate was 75 %. In the group of patients younger than 2 years old  first pass success-rate was 54 %. The total rate of airway management related complications such as vomiting  aspiration  accidental intubation of the oesophagus or right main stem bronchus  hypoxia (oxygen saturation < 90 %) or bradycardia (according to age) was 20 % in children younger than 16 years of age and 38 % in children younger than 2 years of age. No deaths  cardiac arrests or severe bradycardia (heart rate <60) occurred in relation to pre-hospital advanced airway management. Compared with the total population of patients receiving pre-hospital advanced airway management in our system  the overall success rate following pre-hospital endotracheal intubations in children is acceptable but the first-pass success rate is low. The complication rates in the paediatric population are higher than in our pre-hospital advanced airway management patient population as a whole. This illustrates that young children may represent a substantial pre-hospital airway management challenge even for experienced pre-hospital critical care anaesthetists. This may influence future training and quality insurance initiatives in paediatric pre-hospital advanced airway management.
Epidemiology,Neonatology,,Morbidity and mortality in preterm neonates with patent ductus arteriosus on day 3. To assess the association between a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) on day 3 of life and severe morbidity and mortality. Cohort study. Neonatal Intensive Care Unit  Aarhus University Hospital  Denmark. All neonates with a gestational age less than 32 weeks admitted from 2010 to 2012. All neonates (n=183) were routinely screened with echocardiography for PDA on day 3 of life. Information on baseline characteristics and outcome was collected by structured coding sheets and medical records. The association among PDA diameter and pulmonary haemorrhage  intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH)  necrotising enterocolitis  bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)  death  and the composite outcome of death or severe morbidity was assessed. In neonates  born prior to 28 gestational weeks  a PDA on day 3 of life was associated with a threefold increase in odds of death or severe morbidity compared with neonates without PDA (OR=3.4; CI 1.1 to 11). The odds were highest in neonates with a large PDA (diameter ≥1.5 mm). Neonates with a large PDA were also found to have increased odds of IVH (OR 4.2; CI 1.3 to 14) and BPD (OR 3.7; CI 1.0 to 14) compared with neonates with no PDA. In neonates born with a gestational age below 28 weeks the presence of a PDA on day 3 of life was associated with adverse outcome; this association was even more pronounced with a large PDA. Thus  early echocardiography may facilitate the identification of neonates suitable for a targeted approach to intervention in future randomised controlled trials.
Rehabilitation,,,Distribution-based estimates of minimum clinically important difference in cognition  arm function and lower body function after slow release-fampridine treatment of patients with multiple sclerosis. To provide distribution-based estimates of the minimal clinical important difference (MCID) after slow release fampridine treatment on cognition and functional capacity in people with MS (PwMS). MCID values were determined after SR-Fampridine treatment in 105 PwMS. Testing included the Timed 25 Foot Walk (T25FW)  the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT)  the Six Spot Step Test (SSST)  the 9-Hole-Peg-Test (9-HPT)  and the 5-Time-Sit-To-Stand test (5-STS). MCID values: T25FW 17.8% (9.1-17.8)  SDMT 17.1% (9.2-17.1)  SSST 16.7% (8.5-16.7)  9-HPT 15.3% (0-15.3)  and 5-STS 34.6% (16.9-34.6). This study presents distribution-based estimates of MCID values for the SSST  the 9-HPT  and the 5-STS and confirms MCID estimates for the T25FW and the SDMT.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Aminopyridines for symptomatic treatment of multiple sclerosis]. 3 4-diaminopyridine (DAP) and 4-aminopyridine (AP) block potassium channels and can improve action potentials in demyelinated nerve fibres. We identified ten randomised placebo-controlled trials investigating AP/DAP as symptomatic treatment in multiple sclerosis. There is evidence that AP and DAP improve muscle strength in the lower extremities and that AP increases walking speed  and it might improve Expanded Disability Status Scale scores  spasticity and fatigue. There is a lack of evidence-based guidelines of treatment and studies investigating the effect on participation/activity and quality of life.
Sanitation,,,Locally produced natural conditioners for dewatering of faecal sludge. In urban areas of low-income countries  treatment of faecal sludge (FS) is insufficient or non-existent. This results in large amounts of FS being dumped into the environment. Existing treatment technologies for FS  such as settling-thickening tanks and drying beds  are land intensive which is limiting in urban areas. Enhanced settling and dewatering by conditioning was evaluated in order to reduce the treatment footprint (or increase treatment capacity). Conventional wastewater conditioners  such as commercially available lime and polymers  are expensive  and commonly rely on complex supply chains for use in low-income countries. Therefore  the treatment performance of five conditioners which could be produced locally was evaluated: Moringa oleifera seeds and press cake  Jatropha curcas seeds  Jatropha Calotropis leaves and chitosan. M. oleifera seeds and press cake  and chitosan improved settling and dewatering and had a similar performance compared to lime and polymers. Optimal dosages were 400-500 kg M. oleifera/t TS  300-800 kg lime/t TS and 25-50 kg polymer solution/t TS. In comparison  chitosan required 1.5-3.75 kg/t TS. These dosages are comparable to those recommended for wastewater (sludge). The results indicate that conditioning of FS can reduce total suspended solids (TSS) in the effluent of settling-thickening tanks by 22-81% and reduce dewatering time with drying beds by 59-97%. This means that the area of drying beds could be reduced by 59-97% with end-use as soil conditioner  or 9-26% as solid fuel. Least expensive options and availability will depend on the local context. In Dakar  Senegal  chitosan produced from shrimp waste appears to be most promising.
Hematology,Pediatrics,,Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Adolescents and Young Adults Treated in Pediatric and Adult Departments in the Nordic Countries. Studies on adolescents and young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia suggest better results when using pediatric protocols for adult patients  while corresponding data for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are limited. We investigated disease characteristics and outcome for de novo AML patients 10-30 years old treated in pediatric or adult departments. We included 166 patients 10-18 years of age with AML treated according to the pediatric NOPHO-protocols (1993-2009) compared with 253 patients aged 15-30 years treated in hematology departments (1996-2009) in the Nordic countries. The incidence of AML was 4.9/million/year for the age group 10-14 years  6.5 for 15-18 years  and 6.9 for 19-30 years. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) was more frequent in adults and in females of all ages. Pediatric patients with APL had similar overall survival as pediatric patients without APL. Overall survival at 5 years was 60% (52-68%) for pediatric patients compared to 65% (58-70%) for adult patients. Cytogenetics and presenting white blood cell count were the only independent prognostic factors for overall survival. Age was not an independent prognostic factor. No difference was found in outcome for AML patients age 10-30 years treated according to pediatric as compared to adult protocols.
Serology,,,Elimination of interfering activity in serum samples in the Chinese hamster ovary pertussis serology assay. An interfering substance in various frozen serum samples was observed to inhibit the adhesion of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells to microplate surfaces during a CHO pertussis neutralization test  resulting in wells that lacked cells or wells with dead cells after 2 days of incubation. The interfering activity in the serum could be eliminated by (i) transferring cells to other wells after their initial incubation  (ii) adding fetal calf serum (FCS) to the sample dilution buffer  (iii) precoating microplates with FCS  or (iv) preincubating the samples at 4 degrees C for 5 days. Preincubating the samples at 4 degrees C for 5 days reduced the interfering activity in only some of the samples. Adding serum to the sample dilution buffer or precoating the microplates with serum did not influence the antibody titers in the serum samples. The method described may be used for routine applications.
Neurology,,,Progressive disgregation of brain networking from normal aging to Alzheimer's Disease. Independent Component Analysis on FDG-PET data. Brain connectivity has been assessed in several neurodegenerative disorders investigating the mutual correlations between pre-determined regions or nodes. The selective breakdown of brain networks during the progression from the normal aging (NA) to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) has also been observed. We implemented Independent Component Analysis (ICA) on 18F-FDG-PET data in five groups of subjects with cognitive state ranging from NA to AD dementia  including mild cognitive impairment patients not converting (ncMCI) and converting (MCI) to mild AD dementia  in order to disclose the spatial distribution of the independent components (ICs) in each cognitive state  and their accuracy in discriminating the groups. We could identify spatially distinct ICs in each group with an increasing generation of new local circuits proportional to the severity of the disease. AD-specific ICs appeared from the late MCI stage and could discriminate MCI and AD dementia from ncMCI with an accuracy of 83.5%. There was a progressive disgregation of the intrinsic networks from NA to MCI and AD dementia  in an inversely proportional fashion to conversion time. Functional brain connectivity on FDG-PET has been shown by ICA to be gradually disrupted across progressive states of cognitive severity in AD  which might be implemented at individual level  especially for prognostic purposes  and as a surrogate biomarker in intervention trials.
Epidemiology,,,Ejaculatory frequency and the risk of aggressive prostate cancer: Findings from a case-control study. Recent literature reports inverse associations with ejaculator frequency and prostate cancer (PC). We sought to explore the relationship between ejaculatory frequency from ages 20 to 50 and subsequent development of aggressive PC. We conducted a case-control study sampling 2 141 men from private urology practices in Victoria  Australia. Cases were defined as men with high grade or high stage PC and controls being biopsy negative men. Ejaculation frequency recalled at age decades 20  30  and 40 second was assessed by questionnaire. Unconditional multivariable logistic regression models were used to generate odds ratios (ORs). An inverse association with ejaculatory frequency at age 30 to 39 was observed (OR per 5-unit increase per week = 0.83  95% CI: 0.72-0.96) but not at ages 20 to 29 (OR = 1.01  95% CI: 0.89-1.14) or ages 40 to 49 (OR = 0.95  95% CI: 0.81-1.12). This result differed between men with new sexual partners after age 30 (OR = 0.77  P = 0.009) and those with no new partners (OR = 0.97  P = 0.8) though the test for a difference between these estimates was not significant (P = 0.11). We found only weak evidence of an inverse association between ejaculatory frequency in the fourth decade of life and advanced PC  which was not significantly modified by number of new sexual partners. No relationship was found for ejaculatory frequency in the third and fifth decades of life.
Epidemiology,,,Host immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis and risk of tuberculosis: A longitudinal study among Greenlanders. Human immune responses to latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection (LTBI) may enable individuals to control Mtb infection and halt progression to tuberculosis (TB)  a hypothesis applied in several novel TB vaccines. We aimed to evaluate whether immune responses to selected LTBI antigens were associated with subsequent reduced risk of progression to TB. We conducted a population-based cohort study in East Greenland (2012-2014) including individuals aged 5-31years. A personal identifier allowed follow-up in national registers including the TB notification register. Mtb infection was defined by a positive Quantiferon test. Immune responses to LTBI antigens were assessed by whole blood antigen stimulation and interferon gamma measurement. Among 978 participants  67 previously had TB. LTBI antigen (Rv1284  Rv2659  Rv2660c) immune response prevalence was 18%  50%  2% among Mtb-infected and 7%  40%  4% among non-infected (Quantiferon negative) participants. Among 911 participants without prior notified TB  31 were notified with TB during study follow-up. Immune responses to LTBI antigens were not associated with reduced risk of subsequent TB; Rv1284 HR 0.92 (95%CI 0.28-3.04)  Rv2659 HR 1.05 (95%CI 0.51-2.13)  Rv2660c HR 3.06 (95%CI 0.70-13.37). In this large population-based study  human immune responses to selected LTBI antigens were not found to be strongly associated with reduced risk of subsequent TB.
Epidemiology,,,The risk of hearing loss in a population with a high prevalence of chronic suppurative otitis media. Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) affects 65-330 million people in the developing part of the world and develops in early childhood. Knowledge of the long-term effects on hearing is scarce. Hearing loss (HL) can cause reduced ability to communicate  impair language development and academic skills. To estimate the prevalence of HL in a population with a high-risk of CSOM and to identify the risk of permanent hearing loss from CSOM. Ten and 15 years follow-up of two Greenlandic population-based children cohorts. Participants underwent otologic examination and audiometric evaluation. HL was defined using both the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association's (ASHA) and the World Health Organizations's (WHO) definition. Risk factors for HL were analyzed  using binomial logistic regression analysis. A total of 438 individuals aged 11-24 years participated. Using the ASHA definition of HL the prevalence was 50% (95% CI 45.3-54.7). Using the WHO definition of HL the prevalence was 2.5% (95% CI 1.1-3.98). CSOM was the main cause of HL. Co-existing CSOM (OR 16.7  95% CI 8.29-33.65)  spontaneous healing from CSOM (OR 3.75  95% CI 1.62-8.67)  and male gender (OR 2.2  95% CI 1.28-3.78) were associated with HL. Ninety-one percent of children with CSOM developed a permanent hearing loss >15dBHL. CSOM was strongly associated with permanent hearing loss. CSOM was the main reason for HL in this population. The WHO definition of hearing loss is likely to underestimate the burden of hearing loss among children and adolescents in developing countries with a high prevalence of CSOM.
General Practice,,,Action research led to a feasible lifestyle intervention in general practice for people with prediabetes. To develop and pilot a feasible lifestyle intervention for people with prediabetes tailored for general practice. The study was designed to explore (i) what resources and competencies would be required and (ii) which intervention components should be included. In the first of two action research cycles various interventions were explored in general practice. The second cycle tested the intervention described by the end of the first cycle. In total  64 patients  8 GPs and 10 nurses participated. An intervention comprising six consultations to be delivered during the first year after identified prediabetes was found feasible by the general practice staff in terms of resources. Practice nurses possessed the adequate competences to undertake the core part of the intervention. The intervention comprised fixed elements according to structure  time consumption and educational principles  and flexible elements according to educational material and focus points for behaviour change. Clinical relevant reductions in patients' BMI and HbA1c were found. A prediabetes lifestyle intervention for Danish general practice with potential for diabetes prevention was developed based on action research. The transferability of the developed intervention to other general practices depends on the GPs priorities  availability of practice nurses to deliver the core part  and the remuneration system for general practice. The long-term feasibility in larger patient populations is unknown.
Public Health,,,Population movement: a key factor in the epidemiology of neglected tropical diseases. This review provides an overview of the complex ways in which population movements are linked to spread and control of neglected tropical diseases – often exacerbated by insufficient medical services and sanitary infrastructure. A new typology of population movements is suggested which builds on previous work but offers a more comprehensive typology based on the variables of 'onset'  'cause'  'direction' and 'motivation'. Schistosomiasis and leishmaniasis provide examples of the intricate ways in which population movements may play a role. A thorough and context-specific understanding of these patterns combined with the ability and will to launch targeted public health interventions is needed to achieve adequate control of neglected tropical diseases as well as other infectious diseases.
Environmental Health,Public Health,,A comprehensive approach to risk assessment and surveillance guiding public health interventions. Tools are required to identify 'multi-endemic' population segments - in order to benefit the most vulnerable people and to make public health interventions cost-effective. The article suggests a comprehensive risk assessment and surveillance system approach based on a combination of epidemiological  environmental and social determinants. Such a cross-disciplinary approach will combine the advantages of forecasting upcoming disease 'hot spots' with provision of evidence for long-term planning under more stable conditions  and it may in principle apply to any combination of public health problems depending on the local context.
Herbal Medicine,,,Traditional Bhutanese medicine (gSo-BA Rig-PA): an integrated part of the formal health care services. Traditional medicine in Bhutan is known as gSo-ba Rig-pa and is one of the oldest surviving medical traditions in the world. Other medical systems  such as Chinese medicine  Indian Ayurvedic medicine  Unani medicine  Greco-Roman medicine and the country's rich cultures and traditions have greatly influenced the way traditional Bhutanese medicine evolved. However  Buddhist philosophy remains the mainstream of this medical system. gSo-ba Rig-pa's principles are based on the perception the human body is composed of three main elements: rLung ('Air')  mKhris-pa ('Bile') and Bad-kan ('Phlegm'). When these three elements are balanced in the body a person is said to be healthy. The pathophysiology is also different from other medical systems  and the close link to Buddhism is reflected in the spiritual dimensions and the perception that all suffering is caused by ignorance. The treatment of diseases includes behavioral modification  physiotherapy  herbal medicines  minor surgery and spiritual healing. This makes the traditional Bhutanese medicine a unique and holistic health care system. The traditional medicine is an integrated and recognized part of the formal health care services in Bhutan under the auspices of the Ministry of Health. The article highlights three main points which can be learned from the Bhutanese experience: (1) the strong tradition of herbal medicines within gSo-ba Rig-pa forms a unique opportunity to prospect for new leads for development of pharmaceuticals  (2) the availability of the traditional medicine along with biomedicine broadens the health care choices for patients  and (3) the experiences of integrating two conceptually very different health care systems within one ministry contains important managerial lessons to be learned.
Anesthesiology,,,[Implementation of a national training assessment programme in anaesthesiology]. In 2004  outcome-based education and in-training assessment was introduced by a reform of postgraduate medical education in Denmark. An assessment programme covering the introductory year of anaesthesiology was constructed. The purpose of this study was to explore to which degree this programme was implemented in daily practice in the clinical departments and whether the recommended assessment protocol was followed. A questionnaire was distributed to 26 departments and 38 trainees. The response rate for both groups exceeded 90%. Individual learning plans were prepared by (2/3) of the trainees according to both trainees and departments. The various methods in the assessment programme were implemented to a high degree. The use of structured clinical observations was reported by more than 70% of both groups. Global assessments were applied in more than 70% according to both groups. Fifty percent of the trainees and 70% of the departments reported that these were used in accordance with recommendations. The trainees profited from preparing the written assignments  but only half of them found that they were used in accordance with recommendations. In contrast  more than 90% of the departments reported that the assignments were implemented according to recommendations. Practical completion of in-training assessment was considered difficult by 67% of the departments and 30% of trainees. The workload was the primary difficulty reported. In conclusion  the in-training assessment programme of the introductory year of anaesthesia has been implemented to a high degree and the assessment protocol is used according to recommendations.
Global Health,,,Acetabular cup position and risk of dislocation in primary total hip arthroplasty. Background and purpose - Hip dislocation is one of the most common complications following total hip arthroplasty (THA). Several factors that affect dislocation have been identified  including acetabular cup positioning. Optimal values for cup inclination and anteversion are debatable. We performed a systematic review to describe the different methods for measuring cup placement  target zones for cup positioning  and the association between cup positioning and dislocation following primary THA. Methods - A systematic search of literature in the PubMed database was performed (January and February 2016) to identify articles that compared acetabular cup positioning and the risk of dislocation. Surgical approach and methods for measurement of cup angles were also considered. Results - 28 articles were determined to be relevant to our research question. Some articles demonstrated that cup positioning influenced postoperative dislocation whereas others did not. The majority of articles could not identify a statistically significant difference between dislocating and non-dislocating THA with regard to mean angles of cup anteversion and inclination. Most of the articles that assessed cup placement within the Lewinnek safe zone did not show a statistically significant reduction in dislocation rate. Alternative target ranges have been proposed by several authors. Interpretation - The Lewinnek safe zone could not be justified. It is difficult to draw broad conclusions regarding a definitive target zone for cup positioning in THA  due to variability between studies and the likely multifactorial nature of THA dislocation. Future studies comparing cup positioning and dislocation rate should investigate surgical approach separately. Standardized tools for measurement of cup positioning should be implemented to allow comparison between studies.
Nursing,,,Feasibility and Efficacy of Nurse-Driven Acute Stroke Care. Acute stroke care requires rapid assessment and intervention. Replacing traditional sequential algorithms in stroke care with parallel processing using telestroke consultation could be useful in the management of acute stroke patients. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of a nurse-driven acute stroke protocol using a parallel processing model. This is a prospective  nonrandomized  feasibility study of a quality improvement initiative. Stroke team members had a 1-month training phase  and then the protocol was implemented for 6 months and data were collected on a "run-sheet." The primary outcome of this study was to determine if a nurse-driven acute stroke protocol is feasible and assists in decreasing door to needle (intravenous tissue plasminogen activator [IV-tPA]) times. Of the 153 stroke patients seen during the protocol implementation phase  57 were designated as "level 1" (symptom onset <4.5 hours) strokes requiring acute stroke management. Among these strokes  78% were nurse-driven  and 75% of the telestroke encounters were also nurse-driven. The average door to computerized tomography time was significantly reduced in nurse-driven codes (38.9 minutes versus 24.4 minutes; P < .04). The use of a nurse-driven protocol is feasible and effective. When used in conjunction with a telestroke specialist  it may be of value in improving patient outcomes by decreasing the time for door to decision for IV-tPA.
Telemedicine,,,Providing rehabilitation online - invisible work and diagnostic agents. Telecare promises to deliver healthcare services more efficiently while  at the same time  improving the quality of care. The purpose of this paper is to challenge these promises by analysing the implications of introducing telecare in the rehabilitation of patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Empirically  the paper is based on interviews with and observations of rehabilitation therapists and patients taking part in a Danish telerehabilitation programme. Theoretically  the paper draws on Science and Technology Studies. The introduction of telecare alters rehabilitation practices in multiple ways. First  several new time-consuming work routines  carried out in collaboration between therapists  patients and technical professions  emerge. Although crucial in establishing and maintaining telerehabilitation infrastructures  this work remains invisible in evaluations of the programme. Second  rather than simply increasing patient agency  responsibilities are redistributed and negotiated in subtle and non-uniform ways. These negotiations make it less transparent where one responsibility begins and where another potentially conflicting one ends. Evaluations of telecare technologies should pay more attention to work- and responsibility-related effects of introducing telecare in order better to account for predicted and unpredicted as well as desirable and undesirable socio-technical changes. Using an ethnographic approach  the paper points to the discrepancy between simplistic political promises that telecare technologies can serve as tools for improvement  on the one hand  and the substantial changes in the organisation and management of healthcare observed in practice  on the other. Rather than regarding telecare as technologies of improvement  it is more productive to regard them as technologies of change.
Public Health,,,The rise and fall of the world's first fat tax. In 2011  Denmark introduced the world's first tax on saturated fat  but only 15 months later the fat tax was abolished. The aim of this article is to investigate the political processes surrounding the implementation and rapid abolition of the fat tax. Our findings suggest that industry and trade associations were heavily involved in the political process of formulating the fat tax. Industry representatives used certain tactics to oppose the fat tax: threatening lawsuits  predicting welfare losses  casting doubt on evidence  diverting focus and requesting postponement. After the fat tax was implemented  the food industry continued their opposition through intensified lobbyism and juridical actions at EU level. However  other factors seem to have contributed to the fall of the fat tax. The tax received criticism for being poorly designed and gradually lost popularity among health professionals  politicians and the public. In the end  the fat tax was abolished for financial reasons. This study demonstrates how politicians considered the fat tax as a funding source rather than a public health initiative  which resulted in significant shortcomings. Furthermore  we demonstrate that the massive influence by industry stakeholders was not balanced with inputs from public health professionals  who should assume a more proactive role in policy-making.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Impact of the application of the American College of Emergency Physicians recommendations for the admission of patients with syncope on a retrospectively studied population presenting to the emergency department. The goal of our study was to determine the accuracy of the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) clinical policy in identifying patients with a cardiac cause for their syncope and its potential effect on syncope management. Adult patients with syncope presenting to the emergency department (ED) from January 1996 to December 1998 were identified. Diagnosis was established retrospectively by reviewing medical records. The ACEP guidelines were applied to this population. Of the 200 patients identified  115 (57.5%  95% CI 60-64) were admitted from the ED and 24 (12%) were found to have cardiogenic syncope. Of the 24 patients with cardiac syncope  23 were admitted. By applying ACEP level B recommendations to our population  all patients who on further workup were found to have cardiac syncope would have been admitted from the ED (100% sensitivity  95% CI 86-100) and 81% of patients with no cardiac syncope would have been discharged from the ED (81% specificity  95% CI 75-87). The admission rate would have been 28.5% (95% CI 22-35). By extending admission to patients satisfying level C in addition to level B recommendations  the sensitivity  specificity  and admission rate would have been 100% (95% CI 86-100)  33% (95% CI 26-40)  and 71.0% (95% CI 64-77)  respectively. High sensitivity and specificity in identifying patients with cardiogenic syncope and significant reduction in the hospital admission rate were observed by applying ACEP level B recommendations to patients presenting to our ED. Application of level C recommendations did not offer any advantage.
Cardiology,,,Electrical and structural adaptations of the paediatric athlete's heart: a systematic review with meta-analysis. To describe the electrocardiographic (ECG) and echocardiographic manifestations of the paediatric athlete's heart  and examine the impact of age  race and sex on cardiac remodelling responses to competitive sport. Systematic review with meta-analysis. Six electronic databases were searched to May 2016: MEDLINE  PubMed  EMBASE  Web of Science  CINAHL and SPORTDiscus. (1) Male and/or female competitive athletes  (2) participants aged 6-18 years  (3) original research article published in English language. Data from 14 278 athletes and 1668 non-athletes were included for qualitative (43 articles) and quantitative synthesis (40 articles). Paediatric athletes demonstrated a greater prevalence of training-related and training-unrelated ECG changes than non-athletes. Athletes ≥14 years were 15.8 times more likely to have inferolateral T-wave inversion than athletes <14 years. Paediatric black athletes had significantly more training-related and training-unrelated ECG changes than Caucasian athletes. Age was a positive predictor of left ventricular (LV) internal diameter during diastole  interventricular septum thickness during diastole  relative wall thickness and LV mass. When age was accounted for  these parameters remained significantly larger in athletes than non-athletes. Paediatric black athletes presented larger posterior wall thickness during diastole (PWTd) than Caucasian athletes. Paediatric male athletes also presented larger PWTd than females. The paediatric athlete's heart undergoes significant remodelling both before and during 'maturational years'. Paediatric athletes have a greater prevalence of training related and training-unrelated ECG changes than non-athletes  with age  race and sex mediating factors on cardiac electrical and LV structural remodelling.
Anesthesiology,,,Using a Structured Assessment Tool to Evaluate Nontechnical Skills of Nurse Anesthetists. Nontechnical skills are critical for good anesthetic practice but are seldom addressed explicitly in clinical training. The purposes of this study were (1) to evaluate the reliability and validity of the observation-based assessment tool Nurse Anaesthetists' Non-Technical Skills system (N-ANTS) and (2) to evaluate the effect of training nurse anesthetist supervisors in the use of N-ANTS. This system comprises a global rating score  4 categories  and 15 elements to rate nurse anesthetists' nontechnical skills. A 1-day workshop was conducted for 22 nurse anesthetist supervisors to rate nurse anesthetists' nontechnical skills in 9 scripted video scenarios. Data were gathered from 2 rating sessions separated by a 2-hour training session. The interrater reliability was high before and after the training. It remained stable for the global rating score in N-ANTS and its category ratings  but improved at the elements level. When the raters' ratings were compared with ratings by an expert reference group  there was no statistically significant effect on training. We conclude that Danish nurse anesthetist supervisors without further rater training besides their work experience can use N-ANTS to assess nontechnical skills of nurse anesthetists.
Midwifery,Obstetrics,,Simulation-based multiprofessional obstetric anaesthesia training conducted in situ versus off-site leads to similar individual and team outcomes: a randomised educational trial. To investigate the effect of in situ simulation (ISS) versus off-site simulation (OSS) on knowledge  patient safety attitude  stress  motivation  perceptions of simulation  team performance and organisational impact. Investigator-initiated single-centre randomised superiority educational trial. Obstetrics and anaesthesiology departments  Rigshospitalet  University of Copenhagen  Denmark. 100 participants in teams of 10  comprising midwives  specialised midwives  auxiliary nurses  nurse anaesthetists  operating theatre nurses  and consultant doctors and trainees in obstetrics and anaesthesiology. Two multiprofessional simulations (clinical management of an emergency caesarean section and a postpartum haemorrhage scenario) were conducted in teams of 10 in the ISS versus the OSS setting. Knowledge assessed by a multiple choice question test. Individual outcomes: scores on the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire  stress measurements (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory  cognitive appraisal and salivary cortisol)  Intrinsic Motivation Inventory and perceptions of simulations. Team outcome: video assessment of team performance. Organisational impact: suggestions for organisational changes. The trial was conducted from April to June 2013. No differences between the two groups were found for the multiple choice question test  patient safety attitude  stress measurements  motivation or the evaluation of the simulations. The participants in the ISS group scored the authenticity of the simulation significantly higher than did the participants in the OSS group. Expert video assessment of team performance showed no differences between the ISS versus the OSS group. The ISS group provided more ideas and suggestions for changes at the organisational level. In this randomised trial  no significant differences were found regarding knowledge  patient safety attitude  motivation or stress measurements when comparing ISS versus OSS. Although participant perception of the authenticity of ISS versus OSS differed significantly  there were no differences in other outcomes between the groups except that the ISS group generated more suggestions for organisational changes. NCT01792674.
Anesthesiology,,,Customisation of an instrument to assess anaesthesiologists' non-technical skills. The objectives of the study were to identify Danish anaesthesiologists' non-technical skills and to customise the Scottish-developed Anaesthetists' Non-Technical Skills instrument for Danish anaesthesiologists. Six semi-structured group interviews were conducted with 31 operating room team members: anaes-thesiologists  nurse anaesthetists  surgeons  and scrub nurses. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using directed content analysis. Anaesthesiologists' non-technical skills were identified  coded  and sorted using the original instrument as a basis. The resulting prototype instrument was discussed with anaesthesiologists from 17 centres to ensure face validity. Interviews lasted 46-67 minutes. Identified examples of anaesthesiologists' good or poor non-technical skills fit the four categories in the original instrument: situation awareness; decision making; team working; and task management. Anaesthesiologists' leadership role in the operating room was emphasised: the original 'Task Management' category was named 'Leadership'. One new element  'Demonstrating self-awareness' was added under the category 'Situation Awareness'. Compared with the original instrument  half of the behavioural markers were new  which reflected that being aware of and communicating one's own abilities to the team; working systematically; and speaking up to avoid adverse events were important skills. The Anaesthetists' Non-Technical Skills instrument was customised to a Danish setting using the identified non-technical skills for anaesthesiologists and the original instrument as basis. The customised instrument comprises four categories and 16 underpinning elements supported by multiple behavioural markers. Identifying non-technical skills through semi-structured group interviews and analysing them using direct content analysis proved a useful method for customising an assessment instrument to another setting.
Specialties  Surgical,,,[Experience with the training of non-technical skills on a course for surgical trainees]. This paper describes the introduction of the training of non-technical skills on a mandatory course for surgical trainees. The training consisted of an introduction to non-technical skills in a plenum session and was followed by a full-scale simulation with debriefing in which participants reflected on their actions. Evaluations showed that > 90% of the participants found that the subject was relevant for their further training and some requested more simulation training. The course hereby addresses several of the Danish seven roles of a fully trained specialist doctor.
Midwifery,,,Helping mothers survive bleeding after birth: an evaluation of simulation-based training in a low-resource setting. To evaluate "Helping Mothers Survive Bleeding After Birth" (HMS BAB) simulation-based training in a low-resource setting. Educational intervention study. Rural referral hospital in Northern Tanzania. Clinicians  nurse-midwives  medical attendants  and ambulance drivers involved in maternity care. In March 2012  health care workers were trained in HMS BAB  a half-day simulation-based training  using a train-the-trainer model. The training focused on basic delivery care  active management of third stage of labor  and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage  including bimanual uterine compression. Evaluation questionnaires provided information on course perception. Knowledge  skills  and confidence of facilitators and learners were tested before and after training. Four master trainers trained eight local facilitators  who subsequently trained 89 learners. After training  all facilitators passed the knowledge test  but pass rates for the skills test were low (29% pass rate for basic delivery and 0% pass rate for management of postpartum hemorrhage). Evaluation revealed that HMS BAB training was considered acceptable and feasible  although more time should be allocated for training  and teaching materials should be translated into the local language. Knowledge  skills  and confidence of learners increased significantly immediately after training. However  overall pass rates for skills tests of learners after training were low (3% pass rate for basic delivery and management of postpartum hemorrhage). The HMS BAB simulation-based training has potential to contribute to education of health care providers. We recommend a full day of training and validation of the facilitators to improve the training.
Pharmacoepidemiology,,,Evaluation of an ICD-10 algorithm to detect osteonecrosis of the jaw among cancer patients in the Danish National Registry of Patients. This study aimed to validate a predefined algorithm for osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) among cancer patients in the Danish National Registry of Patients and to assess the nature of clinical information recorded in medical charts of ONJ patients. We identified potential ONJ cases recorded in 2005-2010 among cancer patients at the hospital Departments of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (DOMS) in three Danish regions  using a set of codes from the International Classification of Diseases  10th revision (ICD-10). We abstracted DOMS charts of the potential cases  had the ONJ status adjudicated by an expert ONJ adjudication committee (ONJAC)  and computed positive predictive values. For patients with ONJAC-confirmed ONJ  we abstracted the charts for information on ONJ clinical course. Sensitivity of the algorithm was computed using a separate sample of 101 known ONJ cases accrued in 2005-2011. We identified 212 potential ONJ cases  of which 197 (93%) had charts available for abstraction. Eighty-three potential cases were confirmed by ONJAC  with a positive predictive value of 42% (95% confidence interval [CI] 35%-49%). DOMS charts of these 83 cases contained complete information on ONJ clinical course. Information about antiresorptive treatment was recorded for 84% of the patients. Among the 101 known ONJ cases  74 had at least one prespecified ICD-10 code recorded in the Danish National Registry of Patients within ±90 days of the ONJ diagnosis (sensitivity 73%; 95%CI [64%-81%]). The predefined algorithm is not adequate for monitoring ONJ in pharmacovigilance studies. Additional case-finding approaches  coupled with adjudication  are necessary to estimate ONJ incidence accurately.
Evidence-Based Medicine,Thoracic Surgery,,Use of incisional negative pressure wound therapy on closed median sternal incisions after cardiothoracic surgery: clinical evidence and consensus recommendations. Negative pressure wound therapy is a concept introduced initially to assist in the treatment of chronic open wounds. Recently  there has been growing interest in using the technique on closed incisions after surgery to prevent potentially severe surgical site infections and other wound complications in high-risk patients. Negative pressure wound therapy uses a negative pressure unit and specific dressings that help to hold the incision edges together  redistribute lateral tension  reduce edema  stimulate perfusion  and protect the surgical site from external infectious sources. Randomized  controlled studies of negative pressure wound therapy for closed incisions in orthopedic settings (which also is a clean surgical procedure in absence of an open fracture) have shown the technology can reduce the risk of wound infection  wound dehiscence  and seroma  and there is accumulating evidence that it also improves wound outcomes after cardiothoracic surgery. Identifying at-risk individuals for whom prophylactic use of negative pressure wound therapy would be most cost-effective remains a challenge; however  several risk-stratification systems have been proposed and should be evaluated more fully. The recent availability of a single-use  closed incision management system offers surgeons a convenient and practical means of delivering negative pressure wound therapy to their high-risk patients  with excellent wound outcomes reported to date. Although larger  randomized  controlled studies will help to clarify the precise role and benefits of such a system in cardiothoracic surgery  limited initial evidence from clinical studies and from the authors' own experiences appears promising. In light of the growing interest in this technology among cardiothoracic surgeons  a consensus meeting  which was attended by a group of international experts  was held to review existing evidence for negative pressure wound therapy in the prevention of wound complications after surgery and to provide recommendations on the optimal use of negative pressure wound therapy on closed median sternal incisions after cardiothoracic surgery.
Family Practice,,,HbAlc in an unselected population of 4438 people with type 2 diabetes in a Danish county. To describe the use and level of HbA1c in a large unselected Type 2 diabetic population in Denmark. In addition  to describe the characteristics of the patients and the general practitioners in relation to the monitoring of HbA1c. Data were collected from public data files for the period January 1993 to December 1997. The County of Vejle with a background population of 342 597 citizens  303 250 of whom were listed with participating general practitioners. The Type 2 diabetic population alive and resident in the county on 1 January 1997. In a population of 4438 Type 2 diabetics  73% had a minimum of one annual HbA1c measurement in 1997. No HbA1c measurement was associated with a long history of diabetes  diet treatment or old age. Poor glycaemic regulation was found in 65% of the Type 2 diabetics in 1997. Poor glycaemic regulation was associated with tablet or insulin treatment  age under 70 years and long history of diabetes. The interpractice variation was huge. The quality of HbA1c monitoring of Type 2 diabetics needs to be improved. Possibilities for improvement seem to be present.
Family Practice,,,[C-reactive protein and infections in general practice]. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a sensitive and non-specific inflammatory marker. The serum level of CRP starts to rise 6-12 hours after the start of an inflammatory stimulus. Sequential CRP measurements will have greater diagnostic value than a single measurement  and changes of the CRP values often reflect the clinical course. In use in general practice the diagnostic value of CRP is found to be high in adults with pneumonia  sinusitis and tonsillitis  however it is found to be low regarding otitis and pneumonia in children. As to urinary tract infections and salpingitis the value is still undefined. Measurement of CRP is an important diagnostic test but the analysis should not stand by itself but be evaluated together with the patient's history and clinical examination.
Family Practice,,,Near-patient test for C-reactive protein in general practice: assessment of clinical  organizational  and economic outcomes. The benefits of near-patient  point-of-care tests have not been fully examined. We have assessed the clinical  organizational  and economic outcomes of implementing a near-patient test for C-reactive protein (CRP) in general practice. In a randomized crossover trial during intervention periods  general practitioners (GPs) were allowed to measure CRP within 3 min  using NycoCard(R) CRP. During control periods  they had to mail blood samples for CRP measurements to the hospital laboratory and received test results 24-48 h later. Twenty-nine general practice clinics participated (64 GPs)  and 1853 patients were included in the study. Results were evaluated at both the level of participating GPs and the level of included patients. For participating GPs  the overall use of erythrocyte sedimentation rates (ESRs) decreased by 8% (95% confidence interval  1-14%) during intervention periods  and the number of blood samples mailed to the hospital laboratory decreased by 6% (1-10%). No reduction in the prescription of antibiotics was seen. The proportion of study patients having a follow-up telephone consultation was reduced from 63% to 53% (P = 0. 0001)  and patients with CRP concentrations >50 mg/L had their antibiotic treatments started earlier when CRP was measured in general practices (P = 0.0161). The implementation of the near-patient CRP test was cost-effective mainly on the basis of a reduction in the use of services from the hospital laboratory by GPs. If the implementation is followed by education and clinical guidelines  opportunities exist for additional reduction in the use of ESR and for a more appropriate use of antibiotics.
Family Practice,,,[Differences in the use of C-reactive protein analysis and erythrocyte sedimentation in general practice and hospitals. Development from 1986 to 1995]. Analysis for C-reactive protein (CRP) was introduced in the Vejle Hospital catchment area in 1987. During the next ten year period the use of CRP has increased to reach a stable level both on hospital wards  out-patient clinics and in general practice. While the use of erythrocyte sedimentation rate on wards has decreased correspondingly  this is not seen in out-patient clinics or in general practice. There are medical as well as practical reasons for this discrepancy. It is believed that the possibility of performing a CRP as a point-of-care test in the GPs office in the future will lead to a reduction in the number of analyses of erythrocyte sedimentation rate performed in general practice as well.
Family Practice,,,[Cross-sectional therapeutic programs--an example of a cooperative health care system. A review with comments]. There is no tradition for sharing the responsibility for episodes of care between the primary and secondary sectors in the Danish health care system. Concurrently with increased international experience with shared care programmes  there is also a growing interest in Denmark in cooperation between the sectors. Based on literature research  shared care programmes are presented as a method of ensuring continuity and quality in treatment of chronic diseases. Experiences in the areas of diabetes  asthma  rheumatoid arthritis  and cancer are described. It is concluded that the Danish health care system is well prepared for the implementation of shared care programmes; there are only few sources of payment in the system  and an extensive continuing medical education system ensures that general practitioners can participate in relevant education. The implementation of shared care programmes in Denmark should be followed by scientific evaluation and documentation of the quality of the treatment programmes.
Family Practice,,,Evaluation of a near-patient test for C-reactive protein used in daily routine in primary healthcare by use of difference plots. We have assessed the technical performance and robustness of NycoCard CRP Whole Blood  a near-patient test for C-reactive protein (CRP)  when used in realistic daily routine situations in general practice clinics (GPC). Thirteen GPCs participated  five of them with technician staff. From 898 patients  split-sample measurements for CRP were made. Results from GPCs were compared with results from a turbidimetric laboratory method  traceable to international reference preparations (IFCC CRM 470). Results were evaluated in difference plots where the expected distribution  due to an estimated analytical variation  was compared with measured differences. Of all difference points  91.5% (n = 819) were within a 95% prediction interval based on the imprecision of both methods. Mean bias (95% confidence interval) was -0.3 mg/L (-0.9 to 0.3). No differences in analytic quality were found between GPCs with technician staffs and GPCs without  and between test results obtained within the first and second week  compared with the rest of the study period. We find the test as good when used in GPCs as could be expected from laboratory testing  and consequently robust  which is a necessity for use in routine situations in general practice. General application of difference plots in test evaluations are discussed in detail.
Family Practice,,,C-reactive protein in general practice--how commonly is it used and why? C-reactive protein (CRP) is a well-known diagnostic tool in general practice. The scope of this study was to assess how frequently CRP is used by general practitioners and to evaluate the reasons for using it. A retrospective part based on data from a laboratory database system  and a prospective part with a questionnaire-based registration. 30 general practice clinics in the catchment area of Vejle County Central Hospital. Retrospectively  all patients from general practice serviced by the laboratory for one year. Prospectively  1190 patients from whom a blood sample was taken for CRP-measurement during a 2 month study period. The frequency of using CRP and the reason requesting it; A) diagnosing a new disease  B) monitoring a well-known disease  or C) "screening". Furthermore; 1) infections  2) chronic inflammatory disease  3) malignant disease  or 4) others. CRP-measurements were ordered in 3.7% of all consultations in general practice and for 34.1% of all patients whose blood sample was analysed at the central laboratory. The use of CRP was as follows: A-1: 28.6%  A-2: 6.7%  A-3 4: 9.3%  B-1: 8.2%  B-2: 12.4%  B-3 4: 6.5%  C-1: 5.7%  C-2: 3.2%  C-3: 3.5% and C-4: 15.2%. Diagnosing a new (infectious) disease was the most frequent single reason for CRP-measurement. There was major interpractice variation. CRP is frequently used in general practice  mostly (65.4%) in the field of infections and chronic inflammatory diseases. Because of major interpractice variation  the most correct way of using CRP should be evaluated and guidelines should be provided.
Otolaryngology,,,Noise exposure of care providers during otosurgical procedures. To monitor the noise exposure of care providers during otological surgery due to drilling and suction in the operating room. A clinical study monitoring different standard otosurgical procedures was conducted; cochlear implantation (CI)  mastotympanoplasty  and mastoidectomy alone. Noise exposure to the surgeon and assistant were monitored with wireless personal noise dosimetry and stationary sound monitoring. Both maximum peak level in dBC (Lpeak) and time-average sound pressure level in dBA (equivalent level or Leq) were measured during drilling episodes. Frequency analysis in one third octaves covering the frequency bands 6.3 Hz to 20 k Hz was performed using a sound analyzing program. When averaged over the entire procedure  the sound pressure level was highest for the surgeon and the assistant with values of 76.0 dBA and 72.5 dBA  respectively  during CI. Lpeak was 135.9 dBC. Leq for the stationary sound measurement was 74.2 dBA. During cortical bone work using a cutting burr  84.6 dBA was measured. Mean values of L95% (estimation of the background noise) were between 55.8 dBA and 61.2 dBA. Frequency analysis showed the highest sound pressure level for all procedures was between 2.5 kHz and 3.15 kHz. This is the first study to use personal sound dosimetry to monitor noise exposure during otosurgical drilling. In accordance with other studies  the results presented show sound levels below international occupational noise level regulations. However  the measured noise exposure during drilling could have negative effects on care providers based on unfavorable acoustical comfort.
Neurosurgery,,,Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination administered early after neurotrauma or neurosurgery. Pneumococcal vaccination is recommended to lower the risk of posttraumatic meningitis  and early vaccination may be of importance. After both trauma and central nervous system injury  immune-suppression may occur  which could affect T-cell function and the response to T-cell dependent vaccines. We therefore aimed to investigate the response to early vaccination with a T-cell independent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV). Thirty-three patients with basilar skull fracture and 23 patients undergoing transsphenoidal pituitary gland surgery were vaccinated with PPSV within 10days after neurotrauma or neurosurgery. Twenty-nine neurosurgical patients vaccinated ⩾3weeks after neurotrauma or neurosurgery served as controls. Serotype-specific anti-polysaccharide binding IgG antibody levels to serotypes 4  6B  9V  14  18C  19F and 23F were determined by enzyme immunoassay. The vaccination was safe and a highly significant antibody response was found against all serotypes in all groups (p<0.001 for each of the serotypes). There were no differences between groups or in the group by time interaction in any of the serotypes. After early and late vaccination  protective levels were found in >80% for serotypes 9V  14  18C  19F and 23F and in 70% and 50% for serotypes 6B and 4  respectively. Patients vaccinated with PPSV within 10days after neurotrauma or neurosurgery respond similarly to those vaccinated after ⩾3weeks  indicating that PPSV can be administered early after neurotrauma or neurosurgery.

Anesthesiology,,,Emergency airway access in children--transtracheal cannulas and tracheotomy assessed in a porcine model. In the rare scenario when it is impossible to oxygenate or intubate a child  no evidence exists on what strategy to follow. The aim of this study was to compare the time and success rate when using two different transtracheal needle techniques and also to measure the success rate and time when performing an emergency tracheotomy in a piglet cadaver model. In this randomized cross-over study  we included 32 anesthesiologists who each inserted two transtracheal cannulas (TTC) using a jet ventilation catheter and an intravenous catheter in a piglet model. Second  they performed an emergency tracheotomy. A maximum of 2 and 4 min were allowed for the procedures  respectively. The TTC procedures were recorded using a video scope. Placement of a transtracheal cannula was successful in 65.6% and 68.8% of the attempts (P = 0.76)  and the median duration of the attempts was 69 and 42 s (P = 0.32)  using the jet ventilation catheter and the intravenous catheter  respectively. Complications were frequent in both groups  especially perforation of the posterior tracheal wall. Performing an emergency tracheotomy was successful in 97%  in a median of 88 s. In a piglet model  we found no significant difference in success rates or time to insert a jet ventilation cannula or an intravenous catheter transtracheally  but the incidence of complications was high. In the same model  we found a 97% success rate for performing an emergency tracheotomy within 4 min with a low rate of complications.
Orthopedics,,,[Time consumption at an orthopedic operating theatre. Physicians' ability to predict their own time consumption]. The aim of the study was to investigate the time spent on different procedures in an orthopaedic operating theatre  and to evaluate the ability of doctors to predict their own time consumption. Time schedules were registered for 146 operations  of these 104 were either knee or hip replacements. Sixty percent of the total time was spent on surgery. The median misjudgment was 15 minutes for surgeons and five minutes for anaesthetists. An improvement in the doctors' ability to predict their own time consumption in the course of the study period could not be demonstrated. Comparing the study period with the similar period the year before it was not possible to demonstrate a change in the number of cancelled operations or the number of days with overtime. Epidural anaesthesia with bupivacaine was the most time consuming anaesthesia  the differences between the other forms of anaesthesia used were insignificant.
Pediatrics,,,[Pre-graduate training program in interviewing children in pediatric departments at the Rigshospitalet and Amager Hospital]. The study describes a training program in interviewing children at the Departments of Pediatrics  Copenhagen University Hospital  Rigshospitalet and Amager Hospital  Faculty of Health  University of Copenhagen and evaluates the training sessions. The students' self-assessment ratings were summarized and compared using Mann-Whitney U test. Most students rated their learning outcome in interviewing children high. In conclusion  training of medical students in interviewing skills in a clinical department of pediatrics is feasible  although time consuming.
Epidemiology,,,Prevalence of neuropathic pain according to the IASP grading system in patients with chronic non-malignant pain. The primary objective was to determine the prevalence of neuropathic pain according to the new International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) grading system. The secondary objective was to compare the system classification of neuropathic pain with the classification of neuropathic pain according to a patient-administered screening questionnaire. A Multidisciplinary Pain Center. One hundred twenty patients with a variety of chronic pain conditions referred to a multidisciplinary pain center. Consecutively referred patients filled out the PainDETECT Questionnaire before the first consultation. During the first consultation  patients had pain history taken and bedside examination performed by a pain specialist. Patients were classified according to the score on the PainDETECT Questionnaire and graded according to the IASP grading system about the certainty of neuropathic pain. According to the IASP grading system  22 patients (18.3%) classified as probable or definite neuropathic pain and 90 patients (75%) as unlikely neuropathic pain. According to the PainDETECT Questionnaire  55 patients (45%) were classified as likely neuropathic pain and 13 patients (10.8%) as unlikely neuropathic pain. Eleven patients (20%) who were classified as neuropathic pain according to PainDETECT were also classified as probable or definite neuropathic pain by the new IASP grading system. According to the new IASP grading system  less than 20% of the patients referred to a multidisciplinary pain center fulfilled the criteria for neuropathic pain. The classification of neuropathic pain with the IASP system varies from the classification of neuropathic pain with the use of a self-administered screening questionnaire.
Dermatology,Ophthalmology,Otolaryngology,The effect of two grading systems on the performance of medical students during oral examinations. Either a pass/fail approach or a seven-point grading scale are used to evaluate students at the Danish universities. The aim of this study was to explore any effect of the assessment methods on student performances during oral exams. In a prospective study including 1 037 examinations in three medical subjects  we investigated the difference in the test scores between the spring- and autumn semester. In the spring semester  the students could either pass or fail the subject (pass/fail) while in the following autumn semester  the students were assessed by tiered grading (seven-point grading scale). Unknown to the students  the examiners assessed the students by the seven-point grading scale also in the spring semester. Students at the international classes who were officially assessed by the seven-point grading scale during both semesters served as control group. The grading scores were significantly higher among students who were aware of being evaluated with the seven-point grading scores compared with the pass/fail group (p < 0.0001). In comparison  no significant difference between the exam results was observed from the spring- to the autumn semester for the control group (p = 0.45). Moreover  the average mark was higher among the international students (mean = 10.3  on the seven-point grading scale) than in the Danish speaking classes (mean = 9.1). The seven-point grading scale seems to motivate students to yield a better performance; hence tiered-grading should probably be preferred to a simple pass/fail approach. none. not relevant.
Anesthesiology,,,[Checklist for training and evaluation of consultants can work in a clinical setting]. Formalised educational programmes for consultants are uncommon in Denmark. Our objective was to introduce a checklist for training and formative evaluation for consultants to see if this was a feasible method. Sixteen anaesthesiologists participated. A checklist for the use of a difficult airway device was developed. The consultants observed an experienced colleague use the device and then did the procedure themselves supervised in the clinical setting  and finally taught a fellow consultant how to do the procedure. Afterwards they were interviewed about the training method. Checklists seem a promising method for consultants and may be applied in the future.
Pharmacogenetics,,,Lack of genetic association between OCT1  ABCB1  and UGT2B7 variants and morphine pharmacokinetics. A high inter-individual variation in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of morphine has been observed. Genetic polymorphisms in genes encoding the organic cation transporter isoform 1 (OCT1)  the efflux transporter p-glycoprotein (ABCB1)  and the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-2B7 (UGT2B7) may influence morphine pharmacokinetics and thus  also pharmacodynamics. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between OCT1  ABCB1  and UGT2B7 variants  and morphine pharmacokinetics and -dynamics in healthy volunteers. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data were collected from a double-blinded  randomized  crossover trial in 37 healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic data were analyzed in NONMEM®  and the time-concentration relationship of morphine  morphine-3-glucuronide  and morphine-6-glucuronide was parameterized as the transit compartment rate constant (ktr)  clearance (CL)  and volume of distribution (VD). The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-150min) and the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) were also calculated. Pharmacodynamic data were measured as pain tolerance thresholds to mechanical stimulation of the rectum and muscle  as well as tonic cold pain stimulation ("the cold pressor test" where hand was immersed in cold water). Six different single nucleotide polymorphisms in three different genes (OCT1 (n=22)  ABCB1 (n=37)  and UGT2B (n=22)) were examined. Neither AUC0-150min  ktr  CL  nor VD were associated with genetic variants in OCT1  ABCB1  and UGT2B7 (all P>0.05). Similarly  the antinociceptive effects of morphine on rectal  muscle  and cold pressor tests were not associated with these genetic variants (all P>0.05). In this experimental study in healthy volunteers  we found no association between different genotypes of OCT1  ABCB1  and UGT2B7  and morphine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Nonetheless  due to methodological limitations we cannot exclude that associations exist.
Pharmacoepidemiology,,,Generic switching of warfarin and risk of excessive anticoagulation: a Danish nationwide cohort study. Generic switching of warfarin was recently repealed in Denmark  as adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports suggested risk of excessive anticoagulation following switches from branded to generic warfarin. We investigated this putative association in a formalized pharmacoepidemiological analysis. We conducted a nationwide cohort study based on Danish healthcare registries  including data from the introduction of generic warfarin until the repeal (January 2011-April 2015). We followed Danish warfarin users over time and compared the rate of incident hospitalizations due to excessive anticoagulation (i.e. increased INR or any bleeding requiring hospitalization) in periods following a recent switch to generic warfarin to the rate in periods without a recent switch. We included 105 751 warfarin users  filling a total of 1 539 640 prescriptions for warfarin (2.5% for generic warfarin). This constituted 89.0% of all warfarin prescriptions in Denmark during the study period. We observed 19 362 switches to generic warfarin during the study period. The adjusted hazard ratio for excessive anticoagulation following a recent switch from branded to generic warfarin was 1.1 (95%CI  0.8-1.4). The result was robust within subgroups and several sensitivity analyses. Switching from branded to generic warfarin is not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization with excessive anticoagulation. However  a minor excess risk of transient INR increase cannot be excluded. Pharmacoepidemiological studies provide an effective method for swift evaluation of hypotheses generated by ADR-reports.
Rehabilitation,,,A randomized  controlled trial of a multi-modal exercise intervention in Huntington's disease. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and benefit of a structured exercise intervention in people with Huntington's Disease (HD). This study was conducted at 6 sites  and participants were randomized into either exercise or control (usual care) groups  and were assessed at baseline  13 and 26 weeks. The intervention was a 12 week  three times per week progressive exercise program  including aerobic (stationary cycling) and upper and lower body strengthening exercise with tapered 1:1 support for 20 of 36 sessions. 314 adults were assessed for eligibility: 248 did not meet inclusion criteria  34 declined  and 32 were recruited and randomized. Three individuals in the intervention group were withdrawn within the first month due to concomitant medical conditions  resulting in 14 participants in intervention and 15 in control groups. There were two AEs in the intervention group  both related to previous medical conditions  and there were two SAEs  both in the control group. The intervention group had better fitness (predicted VO2 max difference: 492.3 ml min(-1)  95% CI: [97.1  887.6])  lower UHDRS mMS (difference 2.9 points  95% [-5.42  -0.32]) and lower weight at Week 13 (difference 2.25 kg  95% CI: [-4.47  -0.03]). This study demonstrates that a short-term exercise intervention is safe and feasible. Individuals with HD may benefit from structured exercise  and intensity  monitoring and support may be key factors in optimizing response. Larger scale trials are now required to fully elucidate the extended clinical potential of exercise in HD. Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN11392629.
Radiation Oncology,,,American College of Radiology (ACR) Radiation Oncology Practice Accreditation: A pattern of change. The American College of Radiology (ACR) Radiation Oncology Practice Accreditation (ROPA) program has accredited more than 600 sites since 2006  including practices within academic  hospital-based  and freestanding settings. The purpose of this report is to evaluate and compare patterns of change in common deficiencies over time. The ACR database was queried to analyze the common deficiencies noted by the ACR ROPA program between 2012 and 2014. Deficiencies were ranked and compared to the top 10 items that were reported in 2006. Between 2012 and 2014  272 new applications and 306 renewals were received. Timely verification of port films  documentation of physician peer review  inclusion of essential elements of a treatment prescription  evidence of a final physicist chart review  documentation of weekly treatment visits  and inclusion of key elements of brachytherapy documentation all improved when compared with 2000-2005. Deficiencies ranked higher on the current review compared with the previous analysis included documentation of a robust quality assurance program  missing elements from the history and physical documentation  and documentation of follow-up visits. Our analysis of changes in patterns of deficiencies across radiation oncology practices reflects changes in our field such as the growing reliance on electronic records and imaging. Accreditation continues to play an integral role in establishing national standards and a nonpunitive  peer-reviewed method to evaluate a practice's compliance with national quality guidelines.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Trends in Gender Differences in Cardiac Care and Outcome After Acute Myocardial Infarction in Western Sweden: A Report From the Swedish Web System for Enhancement of Evidence-Based Care in Heart Disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies (SWEDEHEART). Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death for both genders. Debates are ongoing as to whether gender-specific differences in clinical course  diagnosis  and management of acute myocardial infarction (MI) exist. We compared all men and women who were treated for acute MI at cardiac care units in Västra Götaland  Sweden  between January 1995 and October 2014 by obtaining data from the prospective SWEDEHEART (Swedish Web-System for Enhancement of Evidence-Based Care in Heart Disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies) registry. We performed unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression analyses on complete case data and on imputed data sets. Overall  48 118 patients (35.4% women) were diagnosed with acute MI. Women as a group had better age-adjusted prognosis than men  but this survival benefit was absent for younger women (aged <60 years) and for women with ST-segment elevation MI. Compared with men  younger women and women with ST-segment elevation MI were more likely to develop prehospital cardiogenic shock (adjusted odds ratio 1.67  95% CI 1.30 to 2.16  P<0.001 and adjusted odds ratio 1.31  95% CI 1.16 to 1.48  P<0.001) and were less likely to be prescribed evidence-based treatment at discharge (P<0.001 for β-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers  statins  and P2Y12 antagonists). Differences in treatment between the genders did not decrease over the study period (P>0.1 for all treatments). Women on average have better adjusted prognosis than men after acute MI; however  younger women and women with ST-segment elevation MI have disproportionately poor prognosis and are less likely to be prescribed evidence-based treatment.
Pathology,,,A position paper on standardizing the nonneoplastic kidney biopsy report. The biopsy report for nonneoplastic kidney diseases represents a complex integration of clinical data with light  immunofluorescence  and electron microscopic findings. Practice guidelines for the handling and processing of the renal biopsy have previously been created. However  specific guidelines for essential pathologic parameters that should be included in these pathology reports do not exist. The Renal Pathology Society has coordinated an effort through the formation of an ad hoc committee to enumerate the essential elements and pathologic parameters that should be reported for every biopsy specimen. This endeavor aims to establish a minimum reporting standard and to improve communication between pathologists and other physicians. This document represents the collective effort and consensus opinions of this ad hoc committee of the Renal Pathology Society.
Internal Medicine,,,[The Good Medical Department. The quality of patient information at the departments of internal medicine]. The purpose of this study was to identify the factors that influence the quality of information given in medical departments and to examine the efforts made to ensure the quality and further improvement of this information. The study is part of the research project "The Good Medical Department". A total of 73 semi-structured interviews were carried out with patients  doctors  nurses and departmental managements. The medical records and nursing case notes were analysed. The quality of information given correlates with the staff's knowledge of the period of hospitalization of their patients. Contact with various doctors and nurses results in patients perceiving statements as being divergent. Information is best communicated in a dialogue. The patients want detailed and written information. Documentation of given information in the medical records was scanty. The outcome of this study indicates some areas that can contribute to ensuring the quality and improvement of patient information. Recent studies also describe lack of quality in these areas. It is a question of restructured planning  delegation of responsibility  documentation  written patient information  and training in communication skills.
Immunochemistry,,,Recent applications of affinity interactions in capillary electrophoresis. Systems biology depends on a comprehensive assignment and characterization of the interactions of proteins and polypeptides (functional proteomics) and of other classes of biomolecules in a given organism. High-capacity screening methods are in place for ligand capture and interaction screening  but a detailed dynamic characterization of molecular interactions under physiological conditions in efficiently separated mixtures with minimal sample consumption is presently provided only by electrophoretic interaction analysis in capillaries  affinity CE (ACE). This has been realized in different fields of biology and analytical chemistry  and the resulting advances and uses of ACE during the last 2.5 years are covered in this review. Dealing with anything from small divalent metal ions to large supramolecular assemblies  the applications of ACE span from low-affinity binding of broad specificity being exploited in optimizing selectivity  e.g.  in enantiomer analysis to miniaturized affinity technologies  e.g.  for fast processing immunoassay. Also  approaches that provide detailed quantitative characterization of analyte-ligand interaction for drug  immunoassay  and aptamer development are increasingly important  but various approaches to ACE are more and more generally applied in biological research. In addition  the present overview emphasizes that distinct challenges regarding sensitivity  parallel processing  information-rich detection  interfacing with MS  analyte recovery  and preparative capabilities remain. This will be addressed by future technological improvements that will ensure continuing new applications of ACE in the years to come.
Nursing,,,Suckling induced activation pattern in the brain of rat pups. The aim of the study was to understand the effects of suckling on the brain of the pups by mapping their brain activation pattern in response to suckling. The c-fos method was applied to identify activated neurons. Fasted rat pups were returned to their mothers for suckling and sacrificed 2 hours later for Fos immunohistochemistry. Double labeling was also performed to characterize some of the activated neurons. For comparison  another group of fasted pups were given dry food before Fos mapping. After suckling  we found an increase in the number of Fos-immunoreactive neurons in the insular and somatosensory cortices  central amygdaloid nucleus (CAm)  paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic hypothalamic nuclei  lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPB)  nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS)  and the area postrema. Double labeling experiments demonstrated the activation of calcitonin gene-related peptide-ir (CGRP-ir) neurons in the LPB  corticotropin-releasing hormone-ir (CRH-ir) but not oxytocin-ir neurons in the PVN  and noradrenergic neurons in the NTS. In the CAm  Fos-ir neurons did not contain CRH but were apposed to CGRP-ir fiber terminals. Refeeding with dry food-induced Fos activation in all brain areas activated by suckling. The degree of activation was higher following dry food consumption than suckling in the insular cortex  and lower in the supraoptic nucleus and the NTS. Furthermore  the accumbens  arcuate  and dorsomedial hypothalamic nuclei  and the lateral hypothalamic area  which were not activated by suckling  showed activation by dry food. Neurons in a number of brain areas are activated during suckling  and may participate in the signaling of satiety  taste perception  reward  food  and salt balance regulation.
Aerospace Medicine,,,Venous gas emboli and exhaled nitric oxide with simulated and actual extravehicular activity. The decompression experienced due to the change in pressure from a space vehicle (1013hPa) to that in a suit for extravehicular activity (EVA) (386hPa) was simulated using a hypobaric chamber. Previous ground-based research has indicated around a 50% occurrence of both venous gas emboli (VGE) and symptoms of decompression illness (DCI) after similar decompressions. In contrast  no DCI symptoms have been reported from past or current space activities. Twenty subjects were studied using Doppler ultrasound to detect any VGE during decompression to 386hPa  where they remained for up to 6h. Subjects were supine to simulate weightlessness. A large number of VGE were found in one subject at rest  who had a recent arm fracture; a small number of VGE were found in another subject during provocation with calf contractions. No changes in exhaled nitric oxide were found that can be related to either simulated EVA or actual EVA (studied in a parallel study on four cosmonauts). We conclude that weightlessness appears to be protective against DCI and that exhaled NO is not likely to be useful to monitor VGE.
Gastroenterology,,,Gluten Introduction and the Risk of Coeliac Disease: A Position Paper by the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology  Hepatology  and Nutrition. The European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology  Hepatology and Nutrition recommended in 2008  based on observational data  to avoid both early (<4 months) and late (≥7 months) introduction of gluten and to introduce gluten while the infant is still being breast-fed. New evidence prompted ESPGHAN to revise these recommendations. To provide updated recommendations regarding gluten introduction in infants and the risk of developing coeliac disease (CD) during childhood. The risk of inducing CD through a gluten-containing diet exclusively applies to persons carrying at least one of the CD risk alleles. Because genetic risk alleles are generally not known in an infant at the time of solid food introduction  the following recommendations apply to all infants  although they are derived from studying families with first-degree relatives with CD. Although breast-feeding should be promoted for its other well-established health benefits  neither any breast-feeding nor breast-feeding during gluten introduction has been shown to reduce the risk of CD. Gluten may be introduced into the infant's diet anytime between 4 and 12 completed months of age. In children at high risk for CD  earlier introduction of gluten (4 vs 6 months or 6 vs 12 months) is associated with earlier development of CD autoimmunity (defined as positive serology) and CD  but the cumulative incidence of each in later childhood is similar. Based on observational data pointing to the association between the amount of gluten intake and risk of CD  consumption of large quantities of gluten should be avoided during the first weeks after gluten introduction and during infancy. The optimal amounts of gluten to be introduced at weaning  however  have not been established.
Family Practice,General Practice,,Early intervention for childhood overweight: A randomized trial in general practice. To evaluate the effect of two intervention modalities concerning overweight and obesity among children in general practice. Prospective randomized controlled trial. A total of 60 general practices in the former County of Funen  Denmark. Overweight children  identified by International Obesity Task Force criteria  aged 5-9 years. Model 1 with health consultations in general practice during a two-year period or Model 2  an educational programme for the children and their families in addition to the health consultations. Change in body mass index (BMI) z-score in order to compare the results  independent of gender- and age-related changes over time. A total of 80 children were recruited with 35 and 45 children allocated to Model 1 and Model 2  respectively. No significant differences were found in the change in BMI z-score (SDS) between the two groups. A decrease in the mean BMI z-score from baseline to study end of -0.20 (95%CI -0.38 to -0.01) in Model 1 and -0.26 (95%CI -0.44 to -0.09) in Model 2  respectively  was detected. The majority of the participants (2/3) continued in the study for more than one year in both models  with a mean of 12 consultations in general practice. In this particular setting the two intervention strategies against overweight and obesity did not differ significantly with regard to change in BMI z-scores.
Rehabilitation,,,Effects of treadmill training with load addition on non-paretic lower limb on gait parameters after stroke: A randomized controlled clinical trial. The addition of load on the non-paretic lower limb for the purpose of restraining this limb and stimulating the use of the paretic limb has been suggested to improve hemiparetic gait. However  the results are conflicting and only short-term effects have been observed. This study aims to investigate the effects of adding load on non-paretic lower limb during treadmill gait training as a multisession intervention on kinematic gait parameters after stroke. With this aim  38 subacute stroke patients (mean time since stroke: 4.5 months) were randomly divided into two groups: treadmill training with load (equivalent to 5% of body weight) on the non-paretic ankle (experimental group) and treadmill training without load (control group). Both groups performed treadmill training during 30min per day  for two consecutive weeks (nine sessions). Spatiotemporal and angular gait parameters were assessed by a motion system analysis at baseline  post-training (at the end of 9days of interventions) and follow-up (40days after the end of interventions). Several post-training effects were demonstrated: patients walked faster and with longer paretic and non-paretic steps compared to baseline  and maintained these gains at follow-up. In addition  patients exhibited greater hip and knee joint excursion in both limbs at post-training  while maintaining most of these benefits at follow-up. All these improvements were observed in both groups. Although the proposal gait training program has provided better gait parameters for these subacute stroke patients  our data indicate that load addition used as a restraint may not provide additional benefits to gait training.
Toxicology,,,The new insight on the regulatory role of the vitamin D3 in metabolic pathways characteristic for cancerogenesis and neurodegenerative diseases. Apart from the classical function of regulating intestinal  bone and kidney calcium and phosphorus absorption as well as bone mineralization  there is growing evidence for the neuroprotective function of vitamin D3 through neuronal calcium regulation  the antioxidative pathway  immunomodulation and detoxification. Vitamin D3 and its derivates influence directly or indirectly almost all metabolic processes such as proliferation  differentiation  apoptosis  inflammatory processes and mutagenesis. Such multifactorial effects of vitamin D3 can be a profitable source of new therapeutic solutions for two radically divergent diseases  cancer and neurodegeneration. Interestingly  an unusual association seems to exist between the occurrence of these two pathological states  called "inverse comorbidity". Patients with cognitive dysfunctions or dementia have considerably lower risk of cancer  whereas survivors of cancer have lower prevalence of central nervous system (CNS) disorders. To our knowledge  there are few publications analyzing the role of vitamin D3 in biological pathways existing in carcinogenic and neuropathological disorders.
Nutrigenomics,,,ONION: Functional Approach for Integration of Lipidomics and Transcriptomics Data. To date  the massive quantity of data generated by high-throughput techniques has not yet met bioinformatics treatment required to make full use of it. This is partially due to a mismatch in experimental and analytical study design but primarily due to a lack of adequate analytical approaches. When integrating multiple data types e.g. transcriptomics and metabolomics  multidimensional statistical methods are currently the techniques of choice. Typical statistical approaches  such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA)  that are applied to find associations between metabolites and genes are failing due to small numbers of observations (e.g. conditions  diet etc.) in comparison to data size (number of genes  metabolites). Modifications designed to cope with this issue are not ideal due to the need to add simulated data resulting in a lack of p-value computation or by pruning of variables hence losing potentially valid information. Instead  our approach makes use of verified or putative molecular interactions or functional association to guide analysis. The workflow includes dividing of data sets to reach the expected data structure  statistical analysis within groups and interpretation of results. By applying pathway and network analysis  data obtained by various platforms are grouped with moderate stringency to avoid functional bias. As a consequence CCA and other multivariate models can be applied to calculate robust statistics and provide easy to interpret associations between metabolites and genes to leverage understanding of metabolic response. Effective integration of lipidomics and transcriptomics is demonstrated on publically available murine nutrigenomics data sets. We are able to demonstrate that our approach improves detection of genes related to lipid metabolism  in comparison to applying statistics alone. This is measured by increased percentage of explained variance (95% vs. 75-80%) and by identifying new metabolite-gene associations related to lipid metabolism.
Epidemiology,,,Impact of functional somatic symptoms on 5-7-year-olds' healthcare use and costs. Knowledge about childhood functional somatic symptoms (FSS) and healthcare costs is scarce. This study aims to assess whether FSS in children aged 5-7 years are associated with increased future primary healthcare. At baseline of the observational cohort study  between years 2005 and 2007  1327 children from the Copenhagen Child Cohort were assessed at ages 5-7 years for FSS and chronic physical diseases using the Soma Assessment Interview. Information on primary healthcare use was obtained from the National Health Insurance Service Register  and measured as the price of all medical services outside the hospital during a 4.5-year follow-up period from the day of assessment. Regression with bootstrap bias-corrected and accelerated CIs were performed. 1018 (76.8%) children had no FSS with primary healthcare use adjusted for other child health problems  maternal education and family changes of €448.2  388.2-523.8 and number of face-to-face contacts: 11.90  10.71-13.25; 250 (18.9%) had FSS with healthcare use €441.0  355.0-550.3 and face-to-face contacts: 11.22  9.60-12.91  and 58 (4.4%) had impairing FSS with healthcare use: €625.9  447.9-867.8 and face-to-face contacts: 14.65  11.20-19.00. In unadjusted regression analysis  impairing FSS were associated with increased healthcare use (increased costs: €246.0  67.6-494.3). The adjusted association was slightly attenuated (increased costs: €177.8  1.3-417.0). Impairing FSS in children aged 5-7 years is a predictor for the child's future primary healthcare use. More research on complex predictive models is needed to further explore the clinical significance of these results  and to contribute to the underpinning of early interventions towards impairing FSS in children.
Nursing,,,Becoming Inclusive: A Code of Conduct for Inclusion and Diversity. There are increasing concerns about exclusionary behaviors and lack of diversity in the nursing profession. Exclusionary behaviors  which may include incivility  bullying  and workplace violence  discriminate and isolate individuals and groups who are different  whereas inclusive behaviors encourage diversity. To address inclusion and diversity in nursing  this article offers a code of conduct. This code of conduct builds on existing nursing codes of ethics and applies to nursing students and nurses in both educational and practice settings. Inclusive behaviors that are demonstrated in nurses' relationships with patients  colleagues  the profession  and society are described. This code of conduct provides a basis for measureable change  empowerment  and unification of the profession. Recommendations  implications  and a pledge to action are discussed.
Precision Medicine,,,[Individualized treatment of osteoarticular infections in children may shorten the treatment course]. Older studies have suggested that antibiotic treatment for less than 21 days in children with osteoarticular infections is associated with relapse  and therefore traditionally these infections have been treated for six weeks with an intravenous phase of one week. However  four new prospective studies suggest that if the duration of treatment is individualized and made dependent on the clinical response and the C-reactive protein level  the treatment course may be shortened substantially without increasing the risk of relapse or sequelae. This article reviews older and newer literature on this subject.
Medical Oncology,,,[Evaluation of trainee doctors' skills]. The objective was to perform a needs assessment of trainee doctors' competences within lumbar puncture and bone marrow aspiration in paediatric oncology. Audit of 30 medical records revealed that five procedures  i.e. collegial  supervised administration of chemotherapy  examination of the child  length of bone marrow biopsy  erythrocytes in cerebrospinal fluid  and documentation of procedures in the medical record  were only handled as intended in half of the cases. Education and supervision of trainee doctors should be prioritized in order to increase their competences and decrease the risk of critical incidents.
Evidence-Based Practice,,,Selecting deep brain stimulation or infusion therapies in advanced Parkinson's disease: an evidence-based review. Motor complications in Parkinson's disease (PD) result from the short half-life and irregular plasma fluctuations of oral levodopa. When strategies of providing more continuous dopaminergic stimulation by adjusting oral medication fail  patients may be candidates for one of three device-aided therapies: deep brain stimulation (DBS)  continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusion  or continuous duodenal/jejunal levodopa/carbidopa pump infusion (DLI). These therapies differ in their invasiveness  side-effect profile  and the need for nursing care. So far  very few comparative studies have evaluated the efficacy of the three device-aided therapies for specific motor problems in advanced PD. As a result  neurologists currently lack guidance as to which therapy could be most appropriate for a particular PD patient. A group of experts knowledgeable in all three therapies reviewed the currently available literature for each treatment and identified variables of clinical relevance for choosing one of the three options such as type of motor problems  age  and cognitive and psychiatric status. For each scenario  pragmatic and (if available) evidence-based recommendations are provided as to which patients could be candidates for either DBS  DLI  or subcutaneous apomorphine.
Nursing Methodology Research,,,Living with advanced Parkinson's disease: a constant struggle with unpredictability. This paper is a report of an exploration of patients' lifeworld and way of managing life with advanced Parkinson's disease prior to Deep Brain Stimulation and what they expect from life following this treatment. Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease  which is initially well-treated with L-dopa. Living with Parkinson's disease means living with the experience of continuous loss of independence and self-esteem and unpredictable ON/OFF phenomena. Thus  in the advanced stage of the disease  treatment with Deep Brain Stimulation may become relevant. Eleven patients eligible for Deep Brain Stimulation were interviewed prior to treatment. Data were collected in 2007 and analysed according to the hermeneutic phenomenological methodology of van Manen  using the four existentials as analytic tools. Living with advanced Parkinson's disease can be described as the experience of living with and managing unpredictability. The disease gradually took over  and participants had to struggle with unpredictability on a daily basis. Themes in relation to this were: The body - setting the agenda  Always a struggle to be on time  Living in dependence and compromise - being a burden  and Living with restrained space and changes in social life. Parkinson's disease leads to profound bodily restrictions. Living with an unpredictable body affects all aspects of life  and nurses need to be aware of the impact the disease has on the entire lifeworld  and how this may affect the way treatment is perceived.
Family Practice,,,Management of patients with sore throats in relation to guidelines: an interview study in Sweden. To explore how a group of Swedish general practitioners (GPs) manage patients with a sore throat in relation to current guidelines as expressed in interviews. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyse semi-structured interviews. Swedish primary care. A strategic sample of 25 GPs. Perceived management of sore throat patients. It was found that nine of the interviewed GPs were adherent to current guidelines for sore throat and 16 were non-adherent. The two groups differed in terms of guideline knowledge  which was shared within the team for adherent GPs while idiosyncratic knowledge dominated for the non-adherent GPs. Adherent GPs had no or low concerns for bacterial infections and differential diagnosis whilst non-adherent GPs believed that in patients with a sore throat any bacterial infection should be identified and treated with antibiotics. Patient history and examination was mainly targeted by adherent GPs whilst for non-adherent GPs it was often redundant. Non-adherent GPs reported problems getting patients to abstain from antibiotics  whilst no such problems were reported in adherent GPs. This interview study of sore throat management in a strategically sampled group of Swedish GPs showed that while two-thirds were non-adherent and had a liberal attitude to antibiotics one-third were guideline adherent with a restricted view on antibiotics. Non-adherent GPs revealed significant knowledge gaps. Adherent GPs had discussed guidelines within the primary care team while non-adherent GPs had not. Guideline implementation thus seemed to be promoted by knowledge shared in team discussions.
Cardiology,,,A roadmap to improve the quality of atrial fibrillation management: proceedings from the fifth Atrial Fibrillation Network/European Heart Rhythm Association consensus conference. At least 30 million people worldwide carry a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AF)  and many more suffer from undiagnosed  subclinical  or 'silent' AF. Atrial fibrillation-related cardiovascular mortality and morbidity  including cardiovascular deaths  heart failure  stroke  and hospitalizations  remain unacceptably high  even when evidence-based therapies such as anticoagulation and rate control are used. Furthermore  it is still necessary to define how best to prevent AF  largely due to a lack of clinical measures that would allow identification of treatable causes of AF in any given patient. Hence  there are important unmet clinical and research needs in the evaluation and management of AF patients. The ensuing needs and opportunities for improving the quality of AF care were discussed during the fifth Atrial Fibrillation Network/European Heart Rhythm Association consensus conference in Nice  France  on 22 and 23 January 2015. Here  we report the outcome of this conference  with a focus on (i) learning from our 'neighbours' to improve AF care  (ii) patient-centred approaches to AF management  (iii) structured care of AF patients  (iv) improving the quality of AF treatment  and (v) personalization of AF management. This report ends with a list of priorities for research in AF patients.
Precision Medicine,,,Personalized management of atrial fibrillation: Proceedings from the fourth Atrial Fibrillation competence NETwork/European Heart Rhythm Association consensus conference. The management of atrial fibrillation (AF) has seen marked changes in past years  with the introduction of new oral anticoagulants  new antiarrhythmic drugs  and the emergence of catheter ablation as a common intervention for rhythm control. Furthermore  new technologies enhance our ability to detect AF. Most clinical management decisions in AF patients can be based on validated parameters that encompass type of presentation  clinical factors  electrocardiogram analysis  and cardiac imaging. Despite these advances  patients with AF are still at increased risk for death  stroke  heart failure  and hospitalizations. During the fourth Atrial Fibrillation competence NETwork/European Heart Rhythm Association (AFNET/EHRA) consensus conference  we identified the following opportunities to personalize management of AF in a better manner with a view to improve outcomes by integrating atrial morphology and damage  brain imaging  information on genetic predisposition  systemic or local inflammation  and markers for cardiac strain. Each of these promising avenues requires validation in the context of existing risk factors in patients. More importantly  a new taxonomy of AF may be needed based on the pathophysiological type of AF to allow personalized management of AF to come to full fruition. Continued translational research efforts are needed to personalize management of this prevalent disease in a better manner. All the efforts are expected to improve the management of patients with AF based on personalized therapy.
Psychiatry,,,From Surviving to Advising: A Novel Course Pairing Mental Health and Addictions Service Users as Advisors to Senior Psychiatry Residents. The authors describe a novel course that pairs service users as advisors to senior psychiatry residents with the goals of improving the residents' understanding of recovery  reducing negative stereotypes about people in recovery  and empowering the service users who participated. Service users who had experience working as peer support workers and/or system advocates were selected for a broad and deep understanding of recovery and an ability to engage learners in constructive dialogue. They met monthly with resident advisees over a period of 6 months. They were supported with monthly group supervision meetings and were paid an honorarium. Quantitative evaluations and qualitative feedback from the first two cohorts of the course  comprising 34 pairs  are reported here. The first cohort of residents responded with a wide range of global ratings and reactions. In response to their suggestions  changes were made to the structure of the course to create opportunities for small group learning and reflective writing and to protect time for residents to participate. The second cohort of residents and both cohorts of service users gave acceptably high global ratings. Residents in the second cohort described gaining a number of benefits from the course  including an enhanced understanding of the lived experience of recovery and a greater sense of shared humanity with service users. Advisors described an appreciation for being part of something that has the potential for changing the practice of psychiatry and enhancing the lives of their peers. Positioning service users as advisors to psychiatry residents holds promise as a powerful way of reducing distance between future psychiatrists and service users and facilitating system reform toward person-centered recovery-oriented care.
Anesthesiology,,,Evaluating structured assessment of anaesthesiologists' non-technical skills. Non-technical skills (NTS) are essential for safe and efficient anaesthesia. Assessment instruments with appropriate validity evidence can be used to ensure that anaesthesiologists possess the NTS necessary to deliver high-standard patient care. The aims were to collect validity evidence using a contemporary validity framework for the assessment instrument Anaesthesiologists' Non-Technical Skills in Denmark (ANTSdk) regarding response process and internal structure (including reliability)  and to investigate the effect of rater training on these properties. An explorative study was undertaken at the Danish Institute for Medical Simulation  Copenhagen  Denmark. In a 1-day session  using ANTSdk  a convenience sample of 19 anaesthesiologists rated trainee anaesthesiologists' NTS in nine video-recorded simulation scenarios before and after a 3-h training session. Response process evidence: participants considered ANTSdk useful and feasible for NTS assessment. Internal structure evidence: inter-rater reliability (single measures) largely expressed substantial agreement (ICC ≥ 0.55 and ICC ≥ 0.60 for pre- and post-training ratings respectively). Strong internal consistency of ratings was found (Spearman's correlation coefficient ≥ 0.82). Accuracy of participants' ratings compared with reference ratings (± 1 scale point) was notable (76% and 78% for pre- and post-training ratings  respectively). The results indicate that the elements 'Demonstrating self-awareness'  'Reassessing decisions'  'Assessing competencies'  and 'Supporting others' need more attention in future rater training. The validity evidence collected on content  response process  and internal structure  suggests that ANTSdk is easy to use on video-recorded simulation scenarios  indicating that ANTSdk is a feasible instrument for NTS assessment during anaesthesia training.
Orthopedics,Sports Medicine,,How to set the bar in competency-based medical education: standard setting after an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE). The goal of the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) in Competency-based Medical Education (CBME) is to establish a minimal level of competence. The purpose of this study was to 1) to determine the credibility and acceptability of the modified Angoff method of standard setting in the setting of CBME  using the Borderline Group (BG) method and the Borderline Regression (BLR) method as a reference standard; 2) to determine if it is feasible to set different standards for junior and senior residents  and 3) to determine the desired characteristics of the judges applying the modified Angoff method. The results of a previous OSCE study (21 junior residents  18 senior residents  and six fellows) were used. Three groups of judges performed the modified Angoff method for both junior and senior residents: 1) sports medicine surgeons  2) non-sports medicine orthopedic surgeons  and 3) sports fellows. Judges defined a borderline resident as a resident performing at a level between competent and a novice at each station. For each checklist item  the judges answered yes or no for "will the borderline/advanced beginner examinee respond correctly to this item?" The pass mark was calculated by averaging the scores. This pass mark was compared to that created using both the BG and the BLR methods. A paired t-test showed that all examiner groups expected senior residents to get significantly higher percentage of checklist items correct compared to junior residents (all stations p < 0.001). There were no significant differences due to judge type. For senior residents  there were no significant differences between the cut scores determined by the modified Angoff method and the BG/BLR method. For junior residents  the cut scores determined by the modified Angoff method were lower than the cut scores determined by the BG/BLR Method (all p < 0.01). The results of this study show that the modified Angoff method is an acceptable method of setting different pass marks for senior and junior residents. The use of this method enables both senior and junior residents to sit the same OSCE  preferable in the regular assessment environment of CBME.
Health Occupations,,,Collaborative learning of clinical skills in health professions education: the why  how  when and for whom. This study is designed to provide an overview of why  how  when and for whom collaborative learning of clinical skills may work in health professions education. Collaborative learning of clinical skills may influence learning positively according to the non-medical literature. Training efficiency may therefore be improved if the outcomes of collaborative learning of clinical skills are superior or equivalent to those attained through individual learning. According to a social interaction perspective  collaborative learning of clinical skills mediates its effects through social interaction  motivation  accountability and positive interdependence between learners. Motor skills learning theory suggests that positive effects rely on observational learning and action imitation  and negative effects may include decreased hands-on experience. Finally  a cognitive perspective suggests that learning is dependent on cognitive co-construction  shared knowledge and reduced cognitive load. The literature on the collaborative learning of clinical skills in health science education is reviewed to support or contradict the hypotheses provided by the theories outlined above. Collaborative learning of clinical skills leads to improvements in self-efficacy  confidence and performance when task processing is observable or communicable. However  the effects of collaborative learning of clinical skills may decrease over time as benefits in terms of shared cognition  scaffolding and cognitive co-construction are outweighed by reductions in hands-on experience and time on task. Collaborative learning of clinical skills has demonstrated promising results in the simulated setting. However  further research into how collaborative learning of clinical skills may work in clinical settings  as well as into the role of social dynamics between learners  is required.
Sports Medicine,,,Competency-Based Medical Education: Can Both Junior Residents and Senior Residents Achieve Competence After a Sports Medicine Training Module? Competency-based medical education as a resident-training format will move postgraduate training away from time-based training  to a model based on observable outcomes. The purpose of this study was to determine whether junior residents and senior residents could demonstrate clinical skills to a similar level  after a sports medicine rotation. All residents undertaking a three-month sports medicine rotation had to pass an Objective Structured Clinical Examination. The stations tested the fundamentals of history-taking  examination  image interpretation  differential diagnosis  informed consent  and clinical decision-making. Performance at each station was assessed with a binary station-specific checklist and an overall global rating scale  in which 1 indicated novice  2 indicated advanced beginner  3 indicated competent  4 indicated proficient  and 5 indicated expert. A global rating scale was also given for each domain of knowledge. Over eighteen months  thirty-nine residents (twenty-one junior residents and eighteen senior residents) and six fellows (for a total of forty-five participants) completed the examination. With regard to junior residents and senior residents  analysis using a two-tailed t test demonstrated a significant difference (p < 0.01) in both total checklist score and overall global rating scale; the mean total checklist score (and standard deviation) was 56.15% ± 10.99% for junior residents and 71.87% ± 8.94% for senior residents  and the mean global rating scale was 2.44 ± 0.55 for junior residents and 3.79 ± 0.49 for senior residents. There was a significant difference between junior residents and senior residents for each knowledge domain  with a significance of p < 0.05 for history-taking and p < 0.01 for the remainder of the domains. Despite intensive teaching within a competency-based medical education model  junior residents were not able to demonstrate knowledge as well as senior residents  suggesting that overall clinical experience is critically important for achieving competency as measured by the Objective Structured Clinical Examination.
Health Occupations,Midwifery,,Linking quality of care and training costs: cost-effectiveness in health professions education. To provide a model for conducting cost-effectiveness analyses in medical education. The model was based on a randomised trial examining the effects of training midwives to perform cervical length measurement (CLM) as compared with obstetricians on patients' waiting times. (CLM)  as compared with obstetricians. The model included four steps: (i) gathering data on training outcomes  (ii) assessing total costs and effects  (iii) calculating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and (iv) estimating cost-effectiveness probability for different willingness to pay (WTP) values. To provide a model example  we conducted a randomised cost-effectiveness trial. Midwives were randomised to CLM training (midwife-performed CLMs) or no training (initial management by midwife  and CLM performed by obstetrician). Intervention-group participants underwent simulation-based and clinical training until they were proficient. During the following 6 months  waiting times from arrival to admission or discharge were recorded for women who presented with symptoms of pre-term labour. Outcomes for women managed by intervention and control-group participants were compared. These data were then used for the remaining steps of the cost-effectiveness model. Intervention-group participants needed a mean 268.2 (95% confidence interval [CI]  140.2-392.2) minutes of simulator training and a mean 7.3 (95% CI  4.4-10.3) supervised scans to attain proficiency. Women who were scanned by intervention-group participants had significantly reduced waiting time compared with those managed by the control group (n = 65; mean difference  36.6 [95% CI 7.3-65.8] minutes; p = 0.008)  which corresponded to an ICER of 0.45 EUR minute(-1) . For WTP values less than EUR 0.26 minute(-1)   obstetrician-performed CLM was the most cost-effective strategy  whereas midwife-performed CLM was cost-effective for WTP values above EUR 0.73 minute(-1) . Cost-effectiveness models can be used to link quality of care to training costs. The example used in the present study demonstrated that different training strategies could be recommended as the most cost-effective depending on administrators' willingness to pay per unit of the outcome variable.
Hematology,,,Outbreak of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteraemia in a haematology department. Infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality among immunocompromised patients. In Denmark  an increase in P. aeruginosa isolates from blood cultures from a haematology department prompted a hygienic audit in 2007. Blood cultures that tested positive for P. aeruginosa were collected from the laboratory information system (MADS  Skejby Hospital  Aarhus  Denmark). Environmental samples were obtained from shower heads in the department. The genotype was established by pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). An audit was conducted during the outbreak and 12 months later. The audits were conducted by the method of direct observation. Several PFGE types were involved with no clear association to isolates from environmental samples. The audit revealed poor hygiene related to the handling of central venous catheters. After optimising catheter hygiene  the number of P. aeruginosa bacteraemia cases fell significantly. Since no clear association between patient and environmental genotype was established  it was suspected that central venous catheters were the main portal of entry. This was further supported by a simultaneous decline in bacteraemia cases with coagulase-negative staphylococci. Though several hygienic precautions were taken  the increased focus on disinfection of hubs and injection ports was presumably the more important element. not relevant. not relevant.
Radiology,,,Radiology Trainee Performance in Digital Breast Tomosynthesis: Relationship Between Difficulty and Error-Making Patterns. The aim of this study was to better understand the relationship between digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) difficulty and radiology trainee performance. Twenty-seven radiology residents and fellows and three expert breast imagers reviewed 60 DBT studies consisting of unilateral craniocaudal and medial lateral oblique views. Trainees had no prior DBT experience. All readers provided difficulty ratings and final BI-RADS(®) scores. Expert breast imager consensus interpretations were used to determine the ground truth. Trainee sensitivity  specificity  and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated for low- and high-difficulty subsets of cases as assessed by each trainee him or herself (self-assessed difficulty) and consensus expert-assessed difficulty. For self-assessed difficulty  the trainee AUC was 0.696 for high-difficulty and 0.704 for low-difficulty cases (P = .753). Trainee sensitivity was 0.776 for high-difficulty and 0.538 for low-difficulty cases (P < .001). Trainee specificity was 0.558 for high-difficulty and 0.810 for low-difficulty cases (P < .001). For expert-assessed difficulty  the trainee AUC was 0.645 for high-difficulty and 0.816 for low-difficulty cases (P < .001). Trainee sensitivity was 0.612 for high-difficulty and .784 for low-difficulty cases (P < .001). Trainee specificity was 0.654 for high-difficulty and 0.765 for low-difficulty cases (P = .021). Cases deemed difficult by experts were associated with decreases in trainee AUC  sensitivity  and specificity. In contrast  for self-assessed more difficult cases  the trainee AUC was unchanged because of increased sensitivity and compensatory decreased specificity. Educators should incorporate these findings when developing educational materials to teach interpretation of DBT.
Precision Medicine,Radiology,,Radiogenomics: what it is and why it is important. In recent years  a new direction in cancer research has emerged that focuses on the relationship between imaging phenotypes and genomics. This direction is referred to as radiogenomics or imaging genomics. The question that subsequently arises is: What is the practical significance of elucidating this relationship in improving cancer patient outcomes. In this article  I address this question. Although I discuss some limitations of the radiogenomic approach  and describe scenarios in which radiogenomic analysis might not be the best choice  I also argue that radiogenomics will play a significant practical role in cancer research. Specifically  I argue that the significance of radiogenomics is largely related to practical limitations of currently available data that often lack complete characterization of the patients and poor integration of individual datasets. Radiogenomics offers a practical way to leverage limited and incomplete data to generate knowledge that might lead to improved decision making  and as a result  improved patient outcomes.
Radiology,,,Does Breast Imaging Experience During Residency Translate Into Improved Initial Performance in Digital Breast Tomosynthesis? To determine the initial digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) performance of radiology trainees with varying degrees of breast imaging experience. To test trainee performance with DBT  we performed a reader study  after obtaining IRB approval. Two medical students  20 radiology residents  4 nonbreast imaging fellows  3 breast imaging fellows  and 3 fellowship-trained breast imagers reviewed 60 unilateral DBT studies (craniocaudal and medio-lateral oblique views). Trainees had no DBT experience. Each reader recorded a final BI-RADS assessment for each case. The consensus interpretations from fellowship-trained breast imagers were used to establish the ground truth. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)  sensitivity  and specificity were calculated. For analysis  first- through third-year residents were classified as junior trainees  and fourth-year residents plus nonbreast imaging fellows were classified as senior trainees. The AUCs were .569 for medical students  .721 for junior trainees  .701 for senior trainees  and .792 for breast imaging fellows. The junior and senior trainee AUCs were equivalent (P < .01) using a two one-sided test for equivalence  with a significance threshold of 0.1. The sensitivities and specificities were highest for breast imaging fellows (.778 and .815 respectively)  but similar for junior (.631 and .714  respectively) and senior trainees (.678 and .661  respectively). Initial performance with DBT among radiology residents and nonbreast imaging fellows is independent of years of training. Radiology educators should consider these findings when developing educational materials.
Precision Medicine,Radiology,,Computational approach to radiogenomics of breast cancer: Luminal A and luminal B molecular subtypes are associated with imaging features on routine breast MRI extracted using computer vision algorithms. To identify associations between semiautomatically extracted MRI features and breast cancer molecular subtypes. We analyzed routine clinical pre-operative breast MRIs from 275 breast cancer patients at a single institution in this retrospective  Institutional Review Board-approved study. Six fellowship-trained breast imagers reviewed the MRIs and annotated the cancers. Computer vision algorithms were then used to extract 56 imaging features from the cancers including morphologic  texture  and dynamic features. Surrogate markers (estrogen receptor [ER]  progesterone receptor [PR]  human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 [HER2]) were used to categorize tumors by molecular subtype: ER/PR+  HER2- (luminal A); ER/PR+  HER2+ (luminal B); ER/PR-  HER2+ (HER2); ER/PR/HER2- (basal). A multivariate analysis was used to determine associations between the imaging features and molecular subtype. The imaging features were associated with both luminal A (P = 0.0007) and luminal B (P = 0.0063) molecular subtypes. No association was found for either HER2 (P = 0.2465) or basal (P = 0.1014) molecular subtype and the imaging features. A P-value of 0.0125 (0.05/4) was considered significant. Luminal A and luminal B molecular subtype breast cancer are associated with semiautomatically extracted features from routine contrast enhanced breast MRI.
Radiology,,,Modeling false positive error making patterns in radiology trainees for improved mammography education. While mammography notably contributes to earlier detection of breast cancer  it has its limitations  including a large number of false positive exams. Improved radiology education could potentially contribute to alleviating this issue. Toward this goal  in this paper we propose an algorithm for modeling of false positive error making among radiology trainees. Identifying troublesome locations for the trainees could focus their training and in turn improve their performance. The algorithm proposed in this paper predicts locations that are likely to result in a false positive error for each trainee based on the previous annotations made by the trainee. The algorithm consists of three steps. First  the suspicious false positive locations are identified in mammograms by Difference of Gaussian filter and suspicious regions are segmented by computer vision-based segmentation algorithms. Second  133 features are extracted for each suspicious region to describe its distinctive characteristics. Third  a random forest classifier is applied to predict the likelihood of the trainee making a false positive error using the extracted features. The random forest classifier is trained using previous annotations made by the trainee. We evaluated the algorithm using data from a reader study in which 3 experts and 10 trainees interpreted 100 mammographic cases. The algorithm was able to identify locations where the trainee will commit a false positive error with accuracy higher than an algorithm that selects such locations randomly. Specifically  our algorithm found false positive locations with 40% accuracy when only 1 location was selected for all cases for each trainee and 12% accuracy when 10 locations were selected. The accuracies for randomly identified locations were both 0% for these two scenarios. In this first study on the topic  we were able to build computer models that were able to find locations for which a trainee will make a false positive error in images that were not previously seen by the trainee. Presenting the trainees with such locations rather than randomly selected ones may improve their educational outcomes.
Radiology,,,Using computer-extracted image features for modeling of error-making patterns in detection of mammographic masses among radiology residents. Mammography is the most widely accepted and utilized screening modality for early breast cancer detection. Providing high quality mammography education to radiology trainees is essential  since excellent interpretation skills are needed to ensure the highest benefit of screening mammography for patients. The authors have previously proposed a computer-aided education system based on trainee models. Those models relate human-assessed image characteristics to trainee error. In this study  the authors propose to build trainee models that utilize features automatically extracted from images using computer vision algorithms to predict likelihood of missing each mass by the trainee. This computer vision-based approach to trainee modeling will allow for automatically searching large databases of mammograms in order to identify challenging cases for each trainee. The authors' algorithm for predicting the likelihood of missing a mass consists of three steps. First  a mammogram is segmented into air  pectoral muscle  fatty tissue  dense tissue  and mass using automated segmentation algorithms. Second  43 features are extracted using computer vision algorithms for each abnormality identified by experts. Third  error-making models (classifiers) are applied to predict the likelihood of trainees missing the abnormality based on the extracted features. The models are developed individually for each trainee using his/her previous reading data. The authors evaluated the predictive performance of the proposed algorithm using data from a reader study in which 10 subjects (7 residents and 3 novices) and 3 experts read 100 mammographic cases. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) methodology was applied for the evaluation. The average area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the error-making models for the task of predicting which masses will be detected and which will be missed was 0.607 (95% CI 0.564-0.650). This value was statistically significantly different from 0.5 (p<0.0001). For the 7 residents only  the AUC performance of the models was 0.590 (95% CI 0.537-0.642) and was also significantly higher than 0.5 (p=0.0009). Therefore  generally the authors' models were able to predict which masses were detected and which were missed better than chance. The authors proposed an algorithm that was able to predict which masses will be detected and which will be missed by each individual trainee. This confirms existence of error-making patterns in the detection of masses among radiology trainees. Furthermore  the proposed methodology will allow for the optimized selection of difficult cases for the trainees in an automatic and efficient manner.
Radiology,,,Radiology resident mammography training: interpretation difficulty and error-making patterns. The purpose of this study was to better understand the concept of mammography difficulty and how it affects radiology resident performance. Seven radiology residents and three expert breast imagers reviewed 100 mammograms  consisting of bilateral medial lateral oblique and craniocaudal views  using a research workstation. The cases consisted of normal  benign  and malignant findings. Participants identified abnormalities and scored the difficulty and malignant potential for each case. Resident performance (sensitivity  specificity  and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]) was calculated for self- and expert-assessed high and low difficulties. For cases classified by self-assessed difficulty  the resident AUCs were 0.667 for high difficulty and 0.771 for low difficulty cases (P = .010). Resident sensitivities were 0.707 for high and 0.614 for low difficulty cases (P = .113). Resident specificities were 0.583 for high and 0.905 for low difficulty cases (P < .001). For cases classified by expert-assessed difficulty  the resident AUCs were 0.583 for high and 0.783 for low difficulty cases (P = .001). Resident sensitivities were 0.558 for high and 0.796 for low difficulty cases (P < .001). Resident specificities were 0.714 for high and 0.740 for low difficulty cases (P = .807). Increased self- and expert-assessed difficulty is associated with a decrease in resident performance in mammography. However  while this lower performance is due to a decrease in specificity for self-assessed difficulty  it is due to a decrease in sensitivity for expert-assessed difficulty. These trends suggest that educators should provide a mix of self- and expert-assessed difficult cases in educational materials to maximize the effect of training on resident performance and confidence.
Epidemiology,,,Alcohol-related breast cancer in postmenopausal women - effect of CYP19A1  PPARG and PPARGC1A polymorphisms on female sex-hormone levels and interaction with alcohol consumption and NSAID usage in a nested case-control study and a randomised controlled trial. Alcohol consumption is associated with increased risk of breast cancer (BC)  and the underlying mechanism is thought to be sex-hormone driven. In vitro and observational studies suggest a mechanism involving peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) in a complex with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-α (PGC-1α) and interaction with aromatase (encoded by CYP19A1). Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) may also affect circulating sex-hormone levels by modifying PPARγ activity. In the present study we assessed whether genetic variation in CYP19A1 is associated with risk of BC in a case-control study group nested within the Danish "Diet  Cancer and Health" cohort (ncases = 687 and ncontrols = 687) and searched for gene-gene interaction between CYP19A1 and PPARGC1A  and CYP19A1 and PPARG  and gene-alcohol and gene-NSAID interactions. Association between the CYP19A1 polymorphisms and hormone levels was also examined among 339 non-HRT users. Incidence rate ratios were calculated based on Cox' proportional hazards model. Furthermore  we performed a pilot randomised controlled trial to determine the effect of the PPARG Pro(12)Ala polymorphism and the PPARγ stimulator Ibuprofen on sex-hormone levels following alcohol intake in postmenopausal women (n = 25) using linear regression. Genetic variations in CYP19A1 were associated with hormone levels (estrone: P rs11070844 = 0.009  estrone sulphate: P rs11070844 = 0.01  P rs749292 = 0.004  P rs1062033 = 0.007 and P rs10519297 = 0.03  and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG): P rs3751591 = 0.03) and interacted with alcohol intake in relation to hormone levels (estrone sulphate: P interaction/rs2008691 = 0.02 and P interaction/rs1062033= 0.03  and SHBG: P interaction/rs11070844 = 0.03). CYP19A1/rs3751591 was both associated with SHBG levels (P = 0.03) and with risk of BC (Incidence Rate Ratio = 2.12; 95 % Confidence Interval: 1.02-4.43) such that homozygous variant allele carriers had increased levels of serum SHBG and were at increased risk of BC. Acute intake of alcohol decreased blood estrone (P = <0.0001)  estrone sulphate (P = <0.0001)  and SHBG (P = 0.009) levels  whereas Ibuprofen intake and PPARG Pro(12)Ala genotype had no effect on hormone levels. Our results suggest that genetically determined variation in CYP19A1 is associated with differences in sex hormone levels. However  the genetically determined differences in sex hormone levels were not convincingly associated with BC risk. The results therefore indicate that the genetically determined variation in CYP19A1 contributes little to BC risk and to alcohol-mediated BC risk. NCT02463383  June 3  2015.
Epidemiology,,,Determinants of dietary supplement use--healthy individuals use dietary supplements. The prevalence of dietary supplement use varies largely among populations  and previous studies have indicated that it is high in the Danish population compared with other European countries. The diversity in supplement use across countries indicates that cultural and environmental factors could influence the use of dietary supplements. Only few studies investigating the use of dietary supplements have been conducted in the Danish population. The present cross-sectional study is based on 54 948 Danes  aged 50-64 years  who completed self-administrated questionnaires on diet  dietary supplements and lifestyle between 1993 and 1997. A health index including smoking  physical activity  alcohol and diet  and a metabolic risk index including waist circumference  urinary glucose and measured hypertension were constructed. Logistic regression was used to investigate these determinants in relation to the intake of dietary supplements. We found that 71 % of the participants were dietary supplement users; female sex  older age groups and higher educated participants were more likely to be users of any dietary supplements. One additional point in the health index was associated with 19  16 and 9 % higher likelihood of being user of any  more common and less common supplements  respectively. In the metabolic risk index  one additional point was associated with 17 and 16 % lower likelihood of being user of any supplement and more common supplements  respectively. No significant association was found for less common supplement use. In conclusion  those with the healthiest lifestyle were more likely to use dietary supplements. Thus  lifestyle and dietary composition should be considered as confounders on supplement use and health outcomes.

Epidemiology,,,Association between aortic valve calcification measured on non-contrast computed tomography and aortic valve stenosis in the general population. Aortic valve calcification (AVC) measured on non-contrast computed tomography (CT) has shown correlation to severity of aortic valve stenosis (AS) and mortality in patients with known AS. The aim of this study was to determine the association of CT verified AVC and subclinical AS in a general population undergoing CT. CT scans from 566 randomly selected male participants (age 65-74) in the Danish cardiovascular screening study (DANCAVAS) were analyzed for AVC. All participants with a moderately or severely increased AVC score (≥300 arbitrary units (AU)) and a matched control group were invited for a supplementary echocardiography. AS was graded by indexed aortic valve area (AVAi) on echocardiography as moderate 0.6-0.85 cm(2)/m(2) and severe < 0.6 cm(2)/m(2)  respectively. ROC- and regression analyses were performed. Due to prior valve surgery  and artifacts from ICD leads 16 individuals were excluded from the AVC scoring. Moderate or severe increased AVC was observed in 10.7% (95% CI: 8.4-13.7). Echocardiography was performed in 101 individuals; 32.7% (95% CI: 21.8 to 46.0) with moderate or high AVC score had moderate or severe AS  while none with no or low AVC. A ROC analysis defined an AVC score ≥588 AU to be suggestive of moderate or severe AS (AUC 0.89 ± 0.04  sensitivity 83% and specificity 87%). In the univariate analyses  AVC was the only variable significantly associated with AS. This study indicates an association between CT verified AVC and subclinical AS.
Family Practice,Internal Medicine,,[Can emergency admissions to departments of internal medicine be replaced by planned admissions?]. The aim of the study was to describe the pattern of admissions to a medical department and to analyse how far acute admissions can be replaced by planned subacute admissions to an outpatient department. All acute admissions to the medical department during two six-day periods were registered. The department's registrars filled in a structured questionnaire and the senior registrars evaluated the admissions. In addition  a local general practitioner evaluated one-third of the admissions. Altogether  214 consecutive patients were entered in the study. One-third of the patients had consulted their GP in the week before the admission. Admissions from the casualty department and from GPs were assessed as appropriate in 92% and 71% of the cases  respectively. The senior registrars assessed that 17-20% of the acute admissions could have been replaced by a subacute  planned admission. Only 5% of the patients shared this conclusion. The ability to predict the total length of stay was limited  and greatest accuracy was achieved in prediction of short-term stays. In a medical department with many acute admissions  it is possible to replace acute admissions with planned subacute admissions for a large group of patients.
Forensic Toxicology,Pharmacology  Clinical,Specialization,Clinical Pharmacology in Denmark in 2016 - 40 Years with the Danish Society of Clinical Pharmacology and 20 Years as a Medical Speciality. The Danish Society of Clinical Pharmacology was founded in 1976  and mainly thanks to the persistent efforts of the society  clinical pharmacology became an independent medical speciality in Denmark in 1996. Since then  clinical pharmacology has gone from strength to strength. In the Danish healthcare system  clinical pharmacology has established itself as an indispensible part of the efforts to promote the rational  safe and economic use of drugs. Clinical pharmacologists are active in drug committees both in hospitals and in the primary sector. All clinical pharmacology centres offer a local medicines information service. Some centres have established an adverse drug effect manager function. Only one centre offers a therapeutic drug monitoring service. Clinical pharmacologists are responsible for the toxicological advice at the Danish Poison Information Centre at Bispebjerg University Hospital in the Capital Region. The Department of Clinical Pharmacology at Aarhus University Hospital works closely together with forensic toxicologists and pathologists  covering issues regarding illicit substances  forensic pharmacology  post-mortem toxicology  expert testimony and research. Therapeutic geriatric and psychiatric teach-inns for specialist and junior doctors are among the newest initiatives organized by clinical pharmacologists. Clinical pharmacologists work also in the Danish Medicines Agency and in the Danish pharmaceutical industry  and the latter has in particular a great growth potential for creating new jobs and career opportunities for clinical pharmacologists. As of July 2016  the Danish Society of Clinical Pharmacology has 175 members  and 70 of these are specialists in clinical pharmacology corresponding to approximately 2.5 specialists per 1000 doctors (Denmark has in total 28 000 doctors) or approximately 12 specialists per one million inhabitants.
Regenerative Medicine,,,Safety and Potential Effect of a Single Intracavernous Injection of Autologous Adipose-Derived Regenerative Cells in Patients with Erectile Dysfunction Following Radical Prostatectomy: An Open-Label Phase I Clinical Trial. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men  and radical prostatectomy (RP) often results in erectile dysfunction (ED) and a substantially reduced quality of life. The efficacy of current interventions  principal treatment with PDE-5 inhibitors  is not satisfactory and this condition presents an unmet medical need. Preclinical studies using adipose-derived stem cells to treat ED have shown promising results. Herein  we report the results of a human phase 1 trial with autologous adipose-derived regenerative cells (ADRCs) freshly isolated after a liposuction. Seventeen men suffering from post RP ED  with no recovery using conventional therapy  were enrolled in a prospective phase 1 open-label and single-arm study. All subjects had RP performed 5-18 months before enrolment  and were followed for 6 months after intracavernosal transplantation. ADRCs were analyzed for the presence of stem cell surface markers  viability and ability to differentiate. Primary endpoint was the safety and tolerance of the cell therapy while the secondary outcome was improvement of erectile function. Any adverse events were reported and erectile function was assessed by IIEF-5 scores. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov  NCT02240823. Intracavernous injection of ADRCs was well-tolerated and only minor events related to the liposuction and cell injections were reported at the one-month evaluation  but none at later time points. Overall during the study period  8 of 17 men recovered their erectile function and were able to accomplish sexual intercourse. Post-hoc stratification according to urinary continence status was performed. Accordingly  for continent men (median IIEFinclusion = 7 (95% CI 5-12)  8 out of 11 men recovered erectile function (IIEF6months = 17 (6-23))  corresponding to a mean difference of 0.57 (0.38-0.85; p = 0.0069)  versus inclusion. In contrast  incontinent men did not regain erectile function (median IIEF1/3/6 months = 5 (95% CI 5-6); mean difference 1 (95% CI 0.85-1.18)  p > 0.9999). In this phase I trial a single intracavernosal injection of freshly isolated autologous ADRCs was a safe procedure. A potential efficacy is suggested by a significant improvement in IIEF-5 scores and erectile function. We suggest that ADRCs represent a promising interventional therapy of ED following prostatectomy. Danish Medical Research Council  Odense University Hospital and the Danish Cancer Society.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Premedication in ambulatory surgery]. A substantive amendment to this systematic review was last made on 3 January 2000. Cochrane reviews are regularly checked and updated if necessary. To assess the effect of anxiolytic remedication on time to discharge in adult patients undergoing day case surgery under general anaesthesia. Trials were identified by computerised searches of the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register  MEDLINE  EMBASE  by checking the reference lists of trials and review articles  by handsearching three main anaesthesia journals and by contacting five researchers active in the field and the Product Information departments of the manufactures of five commonly used premedicants. All randomised controlled trials comparing an anxiolytic drug(s) with placebo before general anaesthesia in adult day case surgical patients. We collected data on anaesthetic drugs used  results of tests of psychomotor function where these were used to assess residual effect of premedication  and on times from end of anaesthesia to ability to walk unaided or readiness for discharge from hospital. Formal statistical synthesis of individual trials was not performed in view of the variety of drugs studied. Searching identified twenty-nine reports; fourteen studies  with data from a total of 1263 patients  were considered eligible for analysis. Only two studies specifically addressed the discharge question; both found no delay in premedicated patients. Three other studies used clinical criteria to assess fitness for discharge  though times were not given. Again  there was no difference from placebo. Four studies used both clinical measures and tests of psychomotor function as tests of recovery from anaesthesia. In none of these studies did the premedication appear to delay discharge  although performance on tests of psychomotor function was sometimes still impaired. Of the four studies which used tests of psychomotor function to assess recovery  three showed impaired recovery (after midazolam 7.5 mg  midazolam 15 mg or diazepam 15 mg) which might possibly interfere with discharge from hospital. We have found no evidence of a difference in time to discharge from hospital in patients who received anxiolytic premedication. However  in view of the age and variety of anaesthetic techniques used  inferences for current day-case practice should be made with caution.
Epidemiology,,,Long-term residential road traffic noise and NO2 exposure in relation to risk of incident myocardial infarction - A Danish cohort study. Road traffic is a source of both air pollution and noise; two environmental hazards both found to increase the risk of ischemic heart disease. Given the high correlation between these pollutants  it is important to investigate combined effects  in relation to myocardial infarction (MI). Among 50 744 middle-aged Danes enrolled into the Diet  Cancer and Health cohort from 1993 to 97  we identified 2403 cases of incident MI during a median follow-up of 14.5 years. Present and historical residential addresses from 1987 to 2011 were found in national registries  and traffic noise (Lden) and air pollution (NO2) were modelled for all addresses. Analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard models. Road traffic noise and NO2 were both individually associated with a higher risk of MI  with hazard ratios of 1.14 (1.07-1.21) and 1.08 (1.03-1.12) per inter-quartile range higher 10-year mean of road traffic noise and NO2  respectively. Mutual exposure adjustment reduced the association with 10-year NO2 exposure (1.02 (0.96-1.08))  whereas the association with road traffic noise remained: 1.12 (1.03-1.21). For fatal incident MI  the pattern was similar  but the associations for both pollutants were stronger. In analyses of tertiles across both pollutants  the strongest effects were seen for combined medium/high exposure  especially for fatal MI's. Both road traffic noise and NO2 were associated with a higher risk of MI in single-pollutant models. In two-pollutant models  mainly noise was associated with MI. Combined exposure to both pollutants was associated with the highest risk.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Uncertain evidence for effect of medication reviews of the prescriptions for elderly patients]. Elderly patients are often prescribed several drugs  which might increase the risk of drug-related harms and the risk of not using the drugs as prescribed  both of which can result in increased costs. The literature supports the conclusions in a newly published Cocranereview on four randomized controlled trials (RCT) showing that it is uncertain whether medication reviews reduce mortality or hospital readmissions  but medication reviews seem to reduce emergency department contacts. However  further RCT are needed before implementing medication reviews.
Evidence-Based Practice,Internal Medicine,,[Evidence-based pedagogical principles used at medical specialist workshop]. How should a theoretical postgraduate course be organized to obtain maximum effect? We report an example of a two-day course planned and implemented according to educational approaches previously shown to be effective. The theme of the course is "The old patient"  and the course is compulsory for residents in internal medicine. This case study showed that the methods used were feasible  and the participants gained knowledge. A multiple-choice test before and after the course showed 44% (before) and 64% (after) correct answers  p < 0.001.
Pharmacoepidemiology,,,Increased use of antidepressants at the end of life: population-based study among people aged 65 years and above. The new antidepressants are generally effective and safe for older people  but may have serious side-effects. The use has been rapidly increasing  but focus on upper age groups has been limited. The pattern of antidepressant use as death approaches has never been analysed. To analyse the use of antidepressants among individuals aged 65 years and above with respect to time trends  age and proximity to death. Population-based prescription study. The County of Funen  Denmark  1992-2004 (approximately 470 000 inhabitants). The 1-year prevalence of antidepressants increases steadily over time in all age groups. Among the 65+ year-olds it also increases with age and differs substantially between the youngest and the oldest. Very high prevalences are observed: 26.8% among females 85-89 years old and 17.5% among males 85 years and above in 2004. In all age groups the use of antidepressants increases substantially with proximity to death in the last 3 years of life. In the last phase of life the use is independent of whether the patient dies at age 65 or 90 about 33% of females and 25% of males receive antidepressants in the last 6 months. The use of antidepressants among 65+ year-olds increases with age and proximity to death to very high levels. Future studies may clarify the problems and diagnoses giving rise to the use of antidepressants for such a large proportion of older people  and especially the problems giving rise to treatment as death approaches.
Family Practice,,,Early discontinuation of antidepressants in general practice: association with patient and prescriber characteristics. Most antidepressant treatment is initiated and continued in general practice but  despite current guidelines  treatment duration is often short among patients with depression. Discontinuation may  however  be caused by a complexity of factors  but so far research has focused on drug effects  adverse effects and drug regimens. Our aim was to analyse whether early discontinuation of first-time antidepressant treatment in general practice may be predicted by (i) social position and psychiatric history of the patient; and (ii) demography  practice activity and the general prescribing behaviour of the GP. Early discontinuation  i.e. that patients do not purchase antidepressants in the 6 months following first prescription  was analysed using established databases. Among patients presenting in 174 general practices in Funen County  Denmark  4860 adult first-time users of antidepressants were identified (regardless of diagnosis). The inclusion period was January 1998-June 1999. One in three patients did not purchase antidepressants in the 6 months following first prescription  but rates were higher among those prescribed tricyclic compared with new generation antidepressants. Patients' age and sex did not have an influence  but early discontinuation was more frequent among patients of low socio-economic status and patients prescribed in practices characterized by high prescribing rates. No association with psychiatric history was observed. Early discontinuation is frequent in general practice  and patients of low social status are at greater risk. Adherence-promoting strategies should pay attention to the high prescribing doctors. Further studies may answer the question of whether the association between doctors' prescribing behaviour and early discontinuation is a feature specific to antidepressants or a more general phenomenon.
Geriatric Nursing,Geriatrics,,[Treatment with antidepressants in geriatric departments. Occurrence and record keeping]. The aim of the present study was to describe the occurrence of antidepressant treatment in geriatric departments in Denmark and assess the notes of the patient records in connection with prescription. Patient records for consecutively referred patients in seven geriatric departments were examined and basic information was noted. For users of antidepressants further information about the treatment was noted. A total of 1211 patients records were examined and out of these 338 patients were in treatment with antidepressants (29.7%). The users of antidepressants used more drugs on their discharge from the hospital. For 61.8% (209/338) of the users the treatment had started before the admission and in more than three-fourths the treatment remained unchanged at their discharge  in 9% the treatment was discontinued. 38.2% (129/338) started their treatment during the admission. Depression was stated as being the main reason in 54% of those who continued an ongoing treatment  and in 78% of those who started their treatment during admission. In 98.4%  the beginning of treatment with antidepressants was based upon the file notes. In 34.8% of the records of ongoing treatment no file notes were given. Treatment with antidepressants is common in geriatric departments and most often it is a question of continuation of a treatment that had started before the admission. The study shows that there is a need for an optimization of the file notes.
Epidemiology,,,Rationale and design of a multicenter  international and collaborative Coronary Artery Aneurysm Registry (CAAR). Coronary artery aneurysm is defined as a coronary dilation that exceeds the diameter of adjacent segments or the diameter of the patient's largest normal coronary vessel by 1.5×. It is an uncommon disease that has been diagnosed with increasing frequency since the widespread appearance of coronary angiography. The published incidence varies from 1.5% to 5%  suggesting male dominance and a predilection for the right coronary artery. Although several causes have been described  atherosclerosis accounts for ≥50% of coronary aneurysms in adults. Reported complications include thrombosis and distal embolization  rupture  and vasospasm  causing ischemia  heart failure  or arrhythmias. The natural history and prognosis remain unknown  as definitive data are scarce. Controversies persist regarding the use of medical management (antithrombotic therapy) or interventional/surgical procedures. Only some case reports or small case series are available about this condition. The Coronary Artery Aneurysm Registry (CAAR; http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02563626) is a multicenter international ambispective registry that aims to provide insights on anatomic  epidemiologic  and clinical aspects of this substantially unknown entity. In addition  the registry will assess management strategies (conservative  interventional  or surgical) and their short- and long-term results in a large cohort of patients. ClinicalTrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT02563626.
Pediatrics,,,Use of complementary/alternative medicine among paediatric patients. The use of complementary/alternative medicine (CAM) is increasing. The aim was to characterise the use of CAM among patients in a paediatric department. All patients (aged 0-18 years)  out-patients or hospitalised  in contact with the Department of Paediatrics  Odense University Hospital during a 2 week period in the autumn of 2001 were asked to participate. In total  622 (92%) patients participated. The data were collected in an interviewer administered questionnaire during a short structured interview with the patient and parents. CAM was divided into herbal medicine (herbal drugs or dietary supplements) (HM)  alternative therapy (AT) (i.e. acupuncture) or chiropractic (CHI). Of all patients  53% had tried CAM at least once and 23% had tried CAM within the last month (15% HM  7% AT and 2% CHI). There was no correlation between use of CAM and gender  age or if the patient was out-patient or hospitalised. The users were pre-school children. HM (Bio-Strath and Echinacea) was especially used to strengthen the immune system. Among AT  reflexological treatment was the most popular treatment. The most frequent users of CAM were patients with asthma  eczema or allergy plus patients suffering from gastrointestinal diseases or hospitalised for observation. More than 50% of the users experienced positive effects and 6% had side-effects from AM. Of the CAM users  11% or 2% of the total paediatric population used CAM instead of conventional medicines. Of the paediatric patients  53% had tried complementary/alternative medicine  which was used as a supplement to conventional medicine although we did not know how long it was used. Paediatric patients should be interviewed about their use of complementary/alternative medicine with regard to side-effects  interactions or lack of compliance with conventional medicine.
Orthopedics,,,Trajectory of self-reported pain and function and knee extensor muscle strength in young patients undergoing arthroscopic surgery for meniscal tears: A systematic review and meta-analysis. To investigate the trajectory of patient reported pain and function and knee extensor muscle strength over time in young individuals undergoing arthroscopic meniscal surgery. Systematic review and meta-analysis METHODS: Six databases were searched up to October 13th  2016. People aged 30 years or younger undergoing surgery for a meniscal tear. and comparator: (1) Self-reported pain and function in patients undergoing meniscal surgery compared to a non-operative control group (2). Knee extensor strength in the leg undergoing surgery compared to a healthy control group or the contra-lateral leg. Methodological quality was assessed using the SIGN 50 guidelines. No studies were found on patient reported pain and function. Six studies  including 137 patients were included in the analysis on knee extensor muscle strength. Knee extensor muscle strength was impaired in the injured leg prior to surgery and was still reduced compared with control data up to 12 months after surgery (SMD: -1.16) (95% CI: -1.83; -0.49). All included studies were assessed to have a high risk of bias. No studies were found comparing the trajectory of self-reported pain and function in patients undergoing arthroscopic surgery compared with non-operative treatments for young patients with meniscal tears. Knee extensor strength seemed to be impaired up to 12 months after surgery in young patients undergoing surgery for meniscal tears. The results of the present study should be interpreted with caution due to a limited number of available studies with high risk of bias including relatively few patients.
General Surgery,,,Mobile spaced education for surgery rotation improves National Board of Medical Examiners scores. Use of mobile devices for medical education is increasing. The aim of this study was to describe the implementation of a spaced education-based app study program in a third year medical school surgery rotation and examine its effects on National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) examination performance. Case-based questions were created and distributed to students on a voluntary basis via a mobile app. Questions were repeated in a spaced based manner until mastered. Students completed surveys regarding study habits and app use. NBME examination scores and prior academic measures were obtained. Users of the app were compared to non-users of the app and the previous years' class. One hundred fifty-two students were offered the app; 121 (80%) used it. App users had a final NBME score of 77.5% compared with 68.8% (P < 0.01) in non-users  although their prior academic achievement was better. Categorizing them by their academic achievement and intensity of app use demonstrated significantly higher scores in regular users of the app as compared with casual and non-users in mid (78 versus 75 versus 71.2%  P < 0.01) and low-achieving students (71.4 versus 70 versus 64.6  P < 0.01)  but not high-achieving students (85.3 versus 81.1 versus 79.7  P = 0.09). Stepwise linear regression modeling revealed intensity of app use accounted for 6% of the variance in NBME scores. Use of the app-based program was an effective tool associated with higher scores on standardized tests in lower level achieving students.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Treatment of non-IBD anal fistula. The course of the fistula tract in relation to the anal sphincter is identified by clinical examination under general anaesthesia using a fistula probe and injection of fluid into the external fistula opening. In the event of a complex fistula or in the case of fistula recurrence  this should be supplemented with an endoluminal ultrasound scan and/or an MRI scan. St. Mark's fistula chart should be used for the description. Simple fistulas are amenable to fistulotomy  whereas treatment of complex fistulas requires special expertise and management of all available treatment modalities to tailor the right operation to the individual patient. The given levels of evidence and grades of recommendations are according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine (www.cemb.net).

Anesthesiology,,,Injection pressures by anesthesiologists during simulated peripheral nerve block. Anesthesiologists typically rely on a subjective evaluation ("syringe feel") of possible abnormal resistance to injection while performing a peripheral nerve block (PNB). A greater force required to perform the injection is believed to be associated with intraneural injection. The hypothesis of this study is that anesthesiologists vary in their perception of "normal" injection force  that the syringe feel method is inconsistent in estimating resistance  and that needle design may affect the injection force. Thirty anesthesiologists were asked to inject a local anesthetic  as they would in their everyday practice  through a commonly used syringe and needle assembly. Injection force was measured using an in-line manometer coupled to a computer via an analog-to-digital conversion board. In addition  injection force at clinically relevant injection speeds was determined using 3 differently sized needles from 4 different manufacturers. During a steady injection rate  all anesthesiologists perceived an increase in the force required to inject  even with minor pressures changes (0.6 +/- 0.3 psi). However  the 30 anesthesiologists  21 (70%) initiated injection using a force that resulted in pressures greater than 20 psi; 15 (50%) used a force greater than 25 psi  and 3 (10%) exerted pressures greater than 30 psi. Pressures varied as much as 20-fold among needles of the same gauge/length from different manufacturers (P <.01). Anesthesiologists vary widely in their perception of appropriate force and rate of injection during PNB. The syringe-feel method of assessing injection force is inconsistent and may be further affected by variability in needle design.
Pediatric Nursing,,,Effects of computer reminders on complications of peripheral venous catheters and nurses' adherence to a guideline in paediatric care--a cluster randomised study. Reminder systems in electronic patient records (EPR) have proven to affect both health care professionals' behaviour and patient outcomes. The aim of this cluster randomised trial was to investigate the effects of implementing a clinical practice guideline (CPG) for peripheral venous catheters (PVCs) in paediatric care in the format of reminders integrated in the EPRs  on PVC-related complications  and on registered nurses' (RNs') self-reported adherence to the guideline. An additional aim was to study the relationship between contextual factors and the outcomes of the intervention. The study involved 12 inpatient units at a paediatric university hospital. The reminders included choice of PVC  hygiene  maintenance  and daily inspection of PVC site. Primary outcome was documented signs and symptoms of PVC-related complications at removal  retrieved from the EPR. Secondary outcome was RNs' adherence to a PVC guideline  collected through a questionnaire that also included RNs' perceived work context  as measured by the Alberta Context Tool. Units were allocated into two strata  based on occurrence of PVCs. A blinded simple draw of lots from each stratum randomised six units to the control and intervention groups  respectively. Units were not blinded. The intervention group included 626 PVCs at baseline and 618 post-intervention and the control group 724 PVCs at baseline and 674 post-intervention. RNs included at baseline were 212 (65.4 %) and 208 (71.5 %) post-intervention. No significant effect was found for the computer reminders on PVC-related complications nor on RNs' adherence to the guideline recommendations. The complication rate at baseline and post-intervention was 40.6 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 36.7-44.5) and 41.9 % (95 % CI 38.0-45.8)  for the intervention group and 40.3 % (95 % CI 36.8-44.0) and 46.9 % (95 % CI 43.1-50.7) for the control. In general  RNs' self-rated work context varied from moderately low to moderately high  indicating that conditions for a successful implementation to occur were less optimal. The reminders might have benefitted from being accompanied by a tailored intervention that targeted specific barriers  such as the low frequency of recorded reasons for removal  the low adherence to daily inspection of PVC sites  and the lack of regular feedback to the RNs.

Evidence-Based Practice,,,What Registered Nurses Do and Do Not in the Management of Pediatric Peripheral Venous Catheters and Guidelines: Unpacking the Outcomes of Computer Reminders. Clinical practical guidelines (CPGs) may enhance evidence-based practice  but require implementation. Computer reminders have previously shown various effects in supporting implementation; in a concomitant study  we found no effect on complications in peripheral venous catheters (PVCs) or registered nurses' (RNs) adherence to a CPG in pediatric care. Yet  there is a need to determine how reminders operate in particular contexts. To depict if  in what context  and how computer reminders regarding evidence-based management of PVC in pediatric care are applied according to RNs' actions and experience. Qualitative data from nonparticipant observations and interviews with 18 RNs in four intervention units at a pediatric hospital were analyzed with content analysis. Attention given to the computer reminders varied; the RNs noticed them in units where there was an agreement about the management and recording of PVCs  but not elsewhere. Rather  computer reminders did not facilitate adherence to the PVC-CPG where the CPG was not acknowledged from the start. RNs who knew how to manage PVCs had peer support and received additional reminders  which suggested that the computer reminders added to the significance of PVCs in pediatric care. While the computer reminders alone did not support CPG implementation  they further increased the attention to PVCs in contexts where there was a readiness to change along with a supportive culture. We suggest further studies tailoring implementation strategies to include electronic means if there is a beneficial context.
Pediatric Nursing,,,Relationship between work context and adherence to a clinical practice guideline for peripheral venous catheters among registered nurses in pediatric care. It is known that registered nurses' (RNs') work context is related to their use of research and that it can affect nurse and patient satisfaction  as well as the outcomes of care. However  little is known about the relationship between work context and nurses' adherence to clinical practice guidelines. The aim of this study was to describe RNs' adherence to a clinical practice guideline (CPG) on the management of peripheral venous catheters (PVCs)  their perceptions of work context  and how nurses' work context and characteristics relate to guideline adherence. This cross-sectional survey was conducted at a large pediatric university hospital in Sweden. Data were collected through a questionnaire on RNs' adherence to components of a CPG and by using the Alberta Context Tool to assess the nurses' perceptions of work context  including leadership  culture  feedback processes  and other organizational characteristics. Work context--in the form of structural and electronic resources  information sharing activities  and feedback processes--was in different ways associated with the adherence to the CPG components. The RNs' adherence on unit level varied: half the units demonstrated complete adherence on disinfection of hands  whereas a majority of the units reported less than 70% adherence on the use of disposable gloves and the daily inspection of a PVC site. Our findings indicate that components in one CPG might require diverse implementation strategies because they are linked to different contextual factors.
Epidemiology,,,Epidemiology of intra- and peri-articular structural injuries in traumatic knee joint hemarthrosis - data from 1145 consecutive knees with subacute MRI. In patients with traumatic knee distorsion and hemarthrosis  to investigate the panorama of structural injury  as visualized on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Cohort study of 1145 consecutive patients with traumatic knee distorsion who underwent MRI within median 8 days after injury. We present structural injury as visualized on MRI in relation to age  sex and activity at injury. Population based gender specific annual incidences of common structural injuries were calculated. The majority of injuries (72%) occurred during sports. Overall  anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture was the most common structural injury (52%)  followed by meniscal tear (41%) and lateral patella dislocation (LPD  17%). Only 12% of ACL tears were isolated with meniscal tear being the most common associated injury (55%). The annual incidence of ACL injury was 77 (70-85  95% CI) per 100 000 inhabitants with significant differences between men (91  80-103) and women (63  53-73). In those aged 16 years and younger  LPD was the most frequent structural injury  both in boys (39%) and girls (43%). In this age group  the annual incidence of LPD was 88 (68-113) and higher in boys (113  81-154) than in girls (62  39-95). ACL injury occurs in one out of two knees with traumatic hemarthrosis but only 12% are without concomitant structural injury. The overall rate of traumatic knee hemarthrosis and ACL injury is higher in men. In those aged 10-19 years  ACL rupture is more common among girls than boys whereas in those 16 years and younger  LPD is more common among boys than girls.
Allergy and Immunology,,,Exposure chamber for allergen challenge. The development and validation of a new concept. Exposure chambers have proven to be valuable tools in studying allergic diseases. The chamber provides a controlled environment and maintains conditions for measuring the amount of allergen inducing symptoms in allergic subjects. The aim of the present study was to develop and test an exposure chamber. The chamber was constructed as an airtight tent  made of transparent polyethylene  easy to adapt to the shape of an existing room  easy to clean  and providing exact allergen-dosage control. Airflow to the interior of the tent was controlled by a variable inlet ventilator fitted with a micropore filter and balanced by a variable high-volume air-sampler on the outlet side. Trace material and allergen were administered as aerosols with a nebulizer connected to the inlet pipe. Samples were obtained from interior surfaces and filters at the outlet. Two different methods were used to test the concept. One method used a colored  neutral trace substance (phenol red indicator) measured photometrically on extracts from filters. Secondly  house-dust mite allergen (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus) was applied  with samples analyzed by an ELISA technique. The results demonstrated the ability of the system to administer and sample allergen with a high degree of reproducibility. A clinical pilot trial proved the capability of the system to initiate symptoms in allergic subjects.
Anesthesiology,Emergency Medicine,,Scandinavian research in anaesthesiology 1981-2000: visibility and impact in EU and world context. We wished to assess the development in number and impact of publications in anaesthesiology and intensive care medicine from 1981 to 2000 in the four Scandinavian countries: Sweden  Norway  Finland  and Denmark. For comparison  we also analyzed data from the UK and the Netherlands. Publication and citation data from 1981 to 2000 were gathered from National Science Indicators (2001)  covering 33 journals indexed in Current Contents. Data were analyzed in running 5-year periods. The following informetric indicators were used: absolute number of publications; absolute number of citations; absolute citation impact (average number of citations per publication per 5-year period); citation impact relative to the European Union and the world; and the percentage of cited papers from each country. The annual number of publications from Denmark was stable over the 20-year period. Sweden increased its production by 35%  while the remaining four countries showed increases from 100% to 146%. Thus  Sweden and Denmark lost visibility within the European Union (EU) and in world context. The EU and world citation shares of Finland and Norway increased slightly  whereas those of Sweden  Denmark  the UK  and the Netherlands all declined significantly. The absolute citation impact (ACI) increased for all the four Scandinavian countries. The ACI of the Netherlands did not change and was surpassed by all the Scandinavian countries by 1994-98  while the UK finished below the other five countries. (1) The annual number of publications from Sweden  Norway  Finland  the UK  and the Netherlands increased after the late eighties  whereas the net publication output from Denmark was stagnant over the 20-year period investigated; (2) the international publication and citation visibility of Finland and Norway increased slightly  as opposed to the significant decrease seen by the other four countries; (3) judging from the increase in absolute and relative citation impact and in the percentage of cited papers  the recognition of publications from the four Scandinavian countries increased over the past 20 years.
Cardiology,Radiology,,Radiation dose among different cardiac and vascular invasive procedures: The RODEO study. Interventional radiology and cardiology procedures contribute significantly to the collective dose of radiation exposure from medical interventions. Recent and dedicated studies comparing directly these procedures in term of patient radiation exposure are lacking. Our aim was to compare radiation exposure among different interventional procedures performed under fluoroscopic guidance. The RODEO study (NCT: 02972736) is an international observational retrospective multicenter study enrolling all patients undergoing diagnostic or interventional procedures performed by different interventional operators (i.e. radiologists  interventional cardiologists or electrophysiologists) in 6 centers  without exclusion criteria. The primary end-point of the study was the comparison of dose area product (DAP) among interventional cardiology  electrophysiology or interventional radiology procedures. A total of 17 711 procedures were included in the study: 13 522 interventional cardiology  2352 electrophysiology and 1864 interventional radiology procedures. The highest DAP values were observed for interventional radiology procedures (74Gy∗cm(2) [Interquartile range 27-178Gy∗cm(2)])  followed by interventional cardiology (40Gy∗cm(2) [22-78Gy∗cm(2)]) and electrophysiology procedures (13Gy∗cm(2) [4-44Gy∗cm(2)]  p<0.0001). In term of specific procedures  the highest DAP values were observed in structural or valvular cardiac procedures (134Gy∗cm(2) [51-260Gy∗cm(2)]) whereas the lowest DAP values in pacemaker insertion (11Gy∗cm(2) [4-28Gy∗cm(2)]). In this large multicenter study  the highest radiation exposure was observed in procedures performed by interventional radiologists. However  among specific procedures  structural or valvular cardiac procedures were associated with the highest radiation exposure.
Pharmacogenetics,,,No association between non-bullous skin reactions from lamotrigine and heterozygosity of UGT1A4 genetic variants *2(P24T) or *3(L48V) in Norwegian patients. High initial serum concentrations increase the risk of cutaneous adverse reactions. Genetic variants of the main metabolizing isoenzyme  uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A4 influence the elimination of lamotrigine (LTG). Our aim was to investigate the potential association between the two best studied variants  *2 (P24T) and *3 (L48V)  and the occurrence non-bullous skin reactions from LTG. The study included 29 patients of Caucasian ethnicity with a history of non-bullous skin reactions from LTG. 184 subjects tolerant to LTG for at least three months were used as controls. UGT1A4 genotyping was performed in all patients and controls by sequencing of the first part of exon 1. Six controls were excluded due to rare genetic variants. Two of 29 subjects (7%) with rash from LTG were heterozygous for UGT1A4 *2  compared to 23 of 178 (13%) tolerant controls (p=0.54). Four of 29 subjects (14%) with rash from LTG were heterozygous for UGT1A4 *3 compared to 25 of 178 (14%) tolerant controls (p=0.97). It is unlikely that heterozygosity of the UGT1A4 genetic variants *2(P24T) or *3(L48V) influences the risk of non-bullous skin reactions in patients treated with LTG.
Nursing Methodology Research,,,Family perceptions of end-of-life care in an urban ICU. As most Canadians die in hospital  the final contact of family members with their loved ones is frequently in an unknown and uncomfortable environment. Family members are integral to the end-of-life decision-making process and are vital contributors to the comfort of dying patients. A quantitative study was conducted in three critical care areas where the stated goals were to provide not only quality care to patients  but also support to families. The researchers sought to determine levels of satisfaction with care  visitation  support  comfort and pain measures. Three hundred surveys were mailed to next of kin who had a loved one die in the critical care areas of an urban tertiary care centre within the prior three years. Survey questions covered such issues as perceptions regarding the decision to stop life supports  access to the patient  access to physicians and nurses and information regarding the patient's status  support provided by the hospital  and organ donation attitudes. Multiple regression analysis revealed that three factors predicted perceptions of overall quality of care: 1) being informed by nurses and physicians of any changes  2) having the same group of nurses provide care  and 3) having one individual act as the family contact. Together these factors accounted for 52% of the variance in perceptions of care. Two factors accounted for 59% of the variance in dissatisfaction with the information received: 1) the perception that physicians did not spend enough time answering family questions  and 2) that the family was not present when the patient died. Consistency in nursing care and provision of information to family members may be difficult in the fast pace of an ICU  but are reasonable program objectives considering the positive influence this has on perceptions of care. Further  flexible visitation policies which maximize access between family members and both their dying loved one and health care professionals appear to have a beneficial effect on satisfaction.
Nursing Methodology Research,Operating Room Nursing,,Trauma and tribulation: the experiences and attitudes of operating room nurses working with organ donors. In the past two decades  significant medical advances have resulted in remarkable success and survival rates for organ recipients. However  the rates of donation have not kept pace with the demand  resulting in a critical shortage of available healthy organs. It has been suggested that the attitudes of medical personnel towards organ retrieval is a key success factor in improving organ donation. Yet there is evidence that those closest to the process of procurement are the most negative. This study sought to examine the attitudes towards organ donation of operating room nurses and their experiences of participating in the procurement of organs for transplant  in order to unravel factors that contribute to their attitudes. This study relied upon in-depth qualitative interviews with 14 operating room nurses who participated in organ procurement in a large urban trauma centre. The results of this study suggest that the process of organ procurement is highly stressful and raises many concerns for operating room nurses. Factors  which added to participants' distress  include organizational factors such as strained relationships within surgical teams  concerns about the dignity of the patient and the well-being of the family and exposure to death and trauma. Experiences of nurses participating in surgical removal of organs for transplantation resulted in personal feelings of distress and negative attitudes to the issue of organ donation which may be transmitted to others and undermine organ procurement efforts. The concerns of these vital members of the organ procurement team should be heeded and actions taken to reduce their distress and improve their attitudes towards donation.
Specialization,,,[The Danish introductory position provides a qualified choice of specialty]. The Danish introductory position is unique. It is placed between internship and the main part of specialist education. Workplace-based assessment according to central objectives is central. The purpose of the introductory position is twofold: the resident is introduced to the specialty - the specialty choice is thus based on a context-based personal experience  and the specialties can assess the potential and suitability of the resident. Also opportunities for career counselling are strengthened. In this way both choice of specialty and selection into the specialties is qualified.
Medicine,Specialization,,[Career counselling and choice of speciality]. Career counselling is meant to support and ensure an early and relevant choice of specialty. Self-awareness regarding personality  life goals  wishes for family life  and lifestyle is of help in narrowing down the number of specialties to those that fit personal attitudes and preferences. The counsellor must be aware that the trainees' subjective opinions about the specialties may not be in line with the actual conditions. Hence  career counselling should provide factual knowledge about the specialties including information on the working conditions and defining characteristics of the specialties.
Pediatrics,,,Consensus on the appropriate use of intrathecal baclofen (ITB) therapy in paediatric spasticity. Among features of motor disorders in children  spasticity is associated with considerable morbidity and problems in care  particularly in severely affected patients. Intrathecal baclofen (ITB) has been increasingly used as a relatively specific treatment modality for spasticity. To date  most of the evidence for its use in paediatric patients has come from retrospective and uncontrolled studies  although randomised  controlled trials of screening ITB and ITB therapy itself have recently been published. This consensus statement on the use of ITB in paediatric patients with spasticity was developed on the basis of currently available evidence  with the aim of providing information for clinicians  promoting an expert opinion and a consistent approach to the management of these patients and emphasising the need for further prospective  large-scale studies.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Antibiotic strategies in the treatment of infection in critically ill patients]. Inappropriate antimicrobial therapy of pneumonia  severe sepsis and bacteraemia is associated with high mortality. Adjustment of insufficient initial antibiotics after susceptibility testing does not reduce mortality. Guidelines on critically ill patients should focus on antibiograms for each intensive care unit to ensure full coverage of initial therapy with a broad-spectrum antibiotic with high tissue penetration  minimal organ toxicity and low risk of resistance development. Early reassessment and withdrawal of antibiotics  if not indicated  are important elements in reducing antibiotic resistance. The initial broad-spectrum should be narrowed according to bacterial susceptibility data. This evidence-based intervention ensures appropriate antimicrobial treatment to critically ill patients to improve outcome and reduction of the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
Gynecology,Obstetrics,Pediatrics,A new model of paired clinical teaching of international and Danish medical students. Since 2006  one hospital has offered two clinical courses in obstetrics/gynaecology and paediatrics to international (I) students. However  as I-student enrolment increased  the hospital faced cut-backs. As from 2010  I-team course evaluations therefore dropped to unacceptable levels and more I- than Danish (DK) students failed exams. Therefore  in 2012 we started a three-year internationalisation project (I-project) at two hospitals. The primary intervention was to pair training for I- and DK-students at clinical contact  and to offer an exclusive daily lecturer for I-teams. We compared the course evaluations and exam grades of I-teams and DK-teams for two years prior to (107 from I-teams - 211 participants from DK-teams) and during the I-project (245 participants from I-teams - 575 from DK-teams). During the I-project  the I-teams' course evaluations increased to acceptable values and to levels comparable to the evaluation scores of DK-teams. Furthermore  I-students now considered that their communication with the patients was acceptable. Before the I-project  I-students had lower exam grades (median = 10 (range: 0-12)) than DK-students (10 (4-12)) (p = 0.03)  but during the I-project  exam grades increased to the levels achieved by DK-students (10 (2-12) - 10 (0-12) (p = 0.22)  and no more I- than DK-students failed exams (p = 0.51). Pairing students for clinical training and allocating an exclusive lecturer for I-teams produced improved courses for internationalisation. Allocating an exclusive lecturer was associated with a cost of about 615 EUR per student per course when the team consisted of ten students. The Capital Region of Denmark and the University of Copenhagen. not relevant.
Neurology,,,Management of dystonia in Europe: a survey of the European network for the study of the dystonia syndromes. Dystonia is difficult to recognize due to its large phenomenological complexity. Thus  the use of experts in dystonia is essential for better recognition and management of dystonia syndromes (DS). Our aim was to document managing strategies  facilities and expertise available in various European countries in order to identify which measures should be implemented to improve the management of DS. A survey was conducted  funded by the Cooperation in Science and Technology  via the management committee of the European network for the study of DS  which is formed from representatives of the 24 countries involved. Lack of specific training in dystonia by general neurologists  general practitioners as well as other allied health professionals was universal in all countries surveyed. Genetic testing for rare dystonia mutations is not readily available in a significant number of countries and neurophysiological studies are difficult to perform due to a lack of experts in this field of movement disorders. Tetrabenazine is only readily available for treatment of dystonia in half of the surveyed countries. Deep brain stimulation is available in three-quarters of the countries  but other surgical procedures are only available in one-quarter of countries. Internationally  collaboration in training  advanced diagnosis  treatment and research of DS and  locally  in each country the creation of multidisciplinary teams for the management of dystonia patients could provide the basis for improving all aspects of dystonia management across Europe.
General Practice,,,Good quality of oral anticoagulation treatment in general practice using international normalised ratio point of care testing. Oral anticoagulation treatment (OACT) with warfarin is common in general practice. Increasingly  international normalised ratio (INR) point of care testing (POCT) is being used to manage patients. The aim of this study was to describe and analyse the quality of OACT with warfarin in general practice in the Capital Region of Denmark using INR POCT. A total of 20 general practices  ten single-handed and ten group practices using INR POCT  were randomly selected to participate in the study. Practice organisation and patient characteristics were recorded. INR measurements were collected retrospectively for a period of six months. For each patient  time in therapeutic range (TTR) was calculated and correlated with practice and patient characteristics using multilevel linear regression models. We identified 447 patients in warfarin treatment in the 20 practices using POCT (median = 19 patients; range: 6-55). The mean TTR for all patients was 69.3% (standard deviation (SD) = 24%)  and for all practices the mean TTR was 67.3% (SD = 6.7%). The TTR in single-handed practices was lower than in group practices  64.6% (SD = 8.0%) and 70.0% (SD = 3.6%)  respectively; but the difference was not significant (4.2 percentage points (pp); 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.8-9.2). Short sampling intervals  e.g. 10-20 days (-11 pp; 95% CI: -16-6)) and lack of diagnostic coding (-11.8 pp; 95% CI: -19.9-3.7) were correlated with a low TTR. In our study most of the general practices using INR POCT in the management of patients in warfarin treatment provided good quality of care. Sampling interval and diagnostic coding were significantly correlated with treatment quality.
Midwifery,,,Uterine contraction induced by Tanzanian plants used to induce abortion. Women in Tanzania use plants to induce abortion. It is not known whether the plants have an effect. Collect data on plant use in relation to induced abortion and test the effect of plant extracts on uterine contraction. During interviews with traditional birth attendants and nurses  plants were identified. Cumulative doses of plant extracts were added to rat uterine tissue in an organ bath  and the force and frequency of contractions recorded. Acetylcholine was used as positive control. 21 plant species were tested for effect on uterine contraction. 11 species increased the force of contraction  and 12 species the frequency of contractions. The strongest contractions comparable to the maximum response obtained with acetylcholine were obtained with extracts of Bidens pilosa  Commelina africana  Desmodium barbatum  Manihot esculenta  Ocimum suave  Oldenlandia corymbosa and Sphaerogyne latifolia. 7 species increased both the force and frequency of contractions. Several of the plant species induced strong and frequent contractions of the uterus  and can be used to induce an abortion.
Epidemiology,,,Low renal replacement therapy incidence among slowly progressing elderly chronic kidney disease patients referred to nephrology care: an observational study. Elderly patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a high risk of death before reaching end-stage kidney disease. In order to allocate resources  such as advanced care nephrology where it is most needed  it is essential to know which patients have the highest absolute risk of advancing to renal replacement therapy (RRT). We included all nephrology-referred CKD stage 3b-5 patients in Sweden 2005-2011 included in the Swedish renal registry (SRR-CKD) who had at least two serum creatinine measurements one year apart (+/- 6 months). We followed these patients to either initiation of RRT  death  or September 30  2013. Decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (%) was estimated during the one-year baseline period. The patients in the highest tertile of progression (>18.7% decline in eGFR) during the initial year of follow-up were classified as "fast progressors". We estimated the cumulative incidence of RRT and death before RRT by age  eGFR and progression status using competing risk models. There were 2119 RRT initiations (24.2%) and 2060 deaths (23.5%) before RRT started. The median progression rate estimated during the initial year was -8.8% (Interquartile range [IQR] - 24.5-6.5%). A fast initial progression rate was associated with a higher risk of RRT initiation (Sub Hazard Ratio [SHR] 2.24 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.00-2.51) and also a higher risk of death before RRT initiation (SHR 1.27 (95% CI 1.13-1.43). The five year probability of RRT was highest in younger patients (<65 years) with fast initial progression rate (51% in CKD stage 4 and 76% in stage 5)  low overall in patients >75 years with a slow progression rate (7  13  and 25% for CKD stages 3b  4 and 5 respectively)  and slightly higher in elderly patients with a fast initial progression rate (28% in CKD stage 4 and 47% in CKD stage 5) or with diabetic kidney disease. The 5-year probability of RRT was low among referred slowly progressing CKD patients >75 years of age because of the competing risk of death.
Epidemiology,,,Cardiovascular disease in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta - a nationwide  register-based cohort study. Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a hereditary connective tissue disease often due to mutations in genes coding for type 1 collagen. Collagen type 1 is important in the development of the heart and vasculature. Little is known about the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in OI. To investigate the risk of symptomatic CVD in OI. A Danish nationwide  population-based and register-based longitudinal open cohort study. All patients registered with the diagnosis of OI from 1977 to 2013 and a reference population matched 5:1 to the OI cohort. Sub-hazard ratios for mitral and aortic valve regurgitation  atrial fibrillation and flutter  heart failure and vascular aneurisms and dissections comparing the OI cohort to the reference population. We identified 687 cases with OI (379 women) and included 3435 reference persons (1895 women). The SHR was 6.3 [95% CI: 2.5-15.5] for mitral valve regurgitation  4.5 [95% CI: 1.4-13.9] for aortic valve regurgitation  1.7 [95% CI: 1.1-2.8] for atrial fibrillation/flutter  and 2.3 [95% CI: 1.4-3.7] for heart failure. The SHRs were not increased arterial aneurisms or dissections. Our results were limited by lacking clinical information about phenotype and genotype of the included patients. We confirm that patients with OI have an increased risk of CVD compared to the general population. This held true even when adjusting for factors that are known to contribute to development of these diseases. Our results suggest that the collagenopathy seen in OI may be part of the pathogenesis of CVD in OI.
Pediatrics,,,Impact of communication skills training on parents perceptions of care: intervention study. This paper is a report of a study of the effects of communication-skills training for healthcare professionals on parents' perceptions of information  care and continuity. As training in communication skills has been more and more integrated into clinical practice it has been subject to an increasing number of studies. However  the majority of studies have been conducted in outpatient clinics  have only targeted physicians  and have not been evaluated from the perspective of patients. This intervention study  conducted from 2005 to 2007  was performed to investigate the effect of a 3-day communication course offered to all healthcare professionals in a department of paediatrics. In a pre-/post-test design  the effect of the intervention was evaluated by the parents using electronic questionnaires filled in on touch-screen computers located centrally in the wards. A total of 895 parents answered the questionnaires before the course (80%) and 1937 answered after the course (72%). For the questions on care and continuity  the proportion of satisfied parents increased statistically significantly for 4 out of 13 questions  e.g. Did you feel that the staff understood you situation? and Did you find that the information given by the different nurses was consistent? For the information questions  no statistically significant differences were found. It is possible to incorporate key communication skills into clinical practice by targeting all healthcare professionals. Communication skills training using interactive methods such as role-play and feedback on video recordings is recommended.
Chiropractic,,,Health care encounters in Danish chiropractic practice from a consumer perspectives - a mixed methods investigation. Perceived value is the key ingredient to carving and maintaining a competitive business niche. The opportunities to interact with consumers to understand and enhance perceived value are termed 'touch points'. Due to the out-of-pocket expense incurred by patients  Danish chiropractors are subject to consumer trends and behaviors. The purpose of this investigation was to explore and describe consumer touch points relevant to perceived value through healthcare journeys in chiropractic practices. We designed a convergent parallel  mixed methods study. Our purposive sampling framework identified 11 chiropractic clinics from which we collected observational field notes  video recordings and face-to-face interviews. Data was collected between April 14(th) and June 26(th) 2014. We described the exteriors and interiors of all participant clinics  interviewed 32 staff members  12 new patients and 36 follow-up patients and finally video recorded 11 new and 24 follow-up consultations. Categorization and analysis led to the emergence six consumer touch point themes: 'the internet'  'the physical environment'  'practice models'  'administrative staff'  'the consultation sequence and timing' and 'a consultation that adds value'. The Internet functions as a tool when choosing/confirming a clinic as appropriate  developing and initial image and managing appointments. The administrative hub appears integral to the shaping of positive consumer experiences outside of the consultation. Clinic location  practice model and interior design may contribute to context effects and thus may influence value perception during the clinical encounter. The duration of hands-on treatment received from the chiropractor is not an apparent consumer focus point. Rather  through a seven stage clinical procedure patients value consultations with clinicians who demonstrate professional competence by effective communication diagnosis/management and facilitating satisfactory treatment outcomes. At least six consumer touch points add/detract from value-related experiences in chiropractic practices. The duration of hands-on treatment per se does not appear to be a particular focus point. More research is required to explore this issue.
Chiropractic,,,The chiropractic profession in Denmark 2010-2014: a descriptive report. The chiropractic profession has been well established in Denmark for several decades with state authorization  partial reimbursement by the state and a formal academic education. Biennial systematic data collections among all chiropractors and clinics have been performed since 2010 in order to provide exact information on the profession to The Danish Chiropractic Association (DCA). It is the aim of this study to outline the major characteristics and developments of the chiropractic profession in Denmark to make this information accessible to other stakeholders  domestic as well as foreign. Using contact information from the DCA  two questionnaires were distributed electronically to all individual members of the association actively working as chiropractors and all clinics respectively in 2010  2012 and 2014. The questions asked were developed for this specific survey. Response rates varied between 59 and 78 % for the clinic questionnaires and 75 to 86 % for the individual questionnaires. Almost half the Danish chiropractors were educated in Denmark and a small majority was female. The average Danish chiropractor of 2014 was 44 years old  graduated 17 years earlier  and worked full time in a primary care clinic with at least one colleague. Half the chiropractors spent more than 20 h a year on continued professional development. Danish chiropractic clinics had a median of 3 treatment rooms  most had digital X-ray equipment  around 6 out of 10 had exercise facilities  and 1 out of 4 employed a physiotherapist. Three out of 4 clinics employed a secretary  too. The average duration of a consultation was 40 min for a new patient and 13 min for a follow-up consultation. Virtually all Danish chiropractors working in the primary sector made use of manipulation as one of their treatment modalities. This is the first study to describe the state and latest development of the chiropractic profession in Denmark using repeated surveys. Displaying various characteristics of both clinics and individual chiropractors  the image emerging is one of a stable profession where rapid or drastic changes are not taking place over short intervals of time.
Chiropractic,,,Compensation claims for chiropractic in Denmark and Norway 2004-2012. Adverse events are commonly observed in all parts of health care and have been reported extensively following manual therapy  including chiropractic. The majority of reported adverse events following chiropractic care are mild  transitory and self-limiting. However  little is known about patient filed compensation claims related to the chiropractic consultation process. The aim of this study was to describe claims reported to the Danish Patient Compensation Association and the Norwegian System of Compensation to Patients related to chiropractic from 2004 to 2012. All finalized compensation claims involving chiropractors reported to one of the two associations between 2004 and 2012 were assessed for age  gender  type of complaint  decisions and appeals. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the study population. 338 claims were registered in Denmark and Norway between 2004 and 2012 of which 300 were included in the analysis. 41 (13.7%) were approved for financial compensation. The most frequent complaints were worsening of symptoms following treatment (n = 91  30.3%)  alleged disk herniations (n = 57  19%) and cases with delayed referral (n = 46  15.3%). A total financial payment of €2 305 757 (median payment €7 730) were distributed among the forty-one cases with complaints relating to a few cases of cervical artery dissection (n = 11  5.7%) accounting for 88.7% of the total amount. Chiropractors in Denmark and Norway received approximately one compensation claim per 100.000 consultations. The approval rate was low across the majority of complaint categories and lower than the approval rates for general practioners and physiotherapists. Many claims can probably be prevented if chiropractors would prioritize informing patients about the normal course of their complaint and normal benign reactions to treatment.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Pelvic floor muscle training in pregnant and parturient women--a survey of a Cochrane review]. Urinary and anal incontinence are prevalent in pregnant and parturient women. Pelvic floor muscle training is frequently employed for prevention and treatment. A recent Cochrane review is discussed. Fifteen studies with a total of 6 181 women were included. Pregnant women without urinary incontinence experienced a reduction of the risk of developing urinary incontinence in later pregnancy or post partum. Peripartum patients with urinary and anal incontinence experienced a reduction of their symptoms following training.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Oestrogen for prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections in postmenopausal women--a survey of a Cochrane review]. Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in postmenopausal women. While the pathophysiology is often complex  it is evident that the urogenital atrophy due to the decrease of endogenous oestrogen production is a key factor. Two small randomized controlled studies have proven the efficacy of local (vaginal) oestrogen therapy in the prevention of recurrent UTIs. Conversely  four randomized trials  reviewed in a weighted meta-analysis with pooled data from 2 798 women  have shown the lack of efficacy of systemic oestrogen-progesterone therapy. Local oestrogen therapy is recommended  if the predominant indication is urogenital symptoms.
Evidence-Based Medicine,Gastroenterology,,Hepato-biliary clinical trials and their inclusion in the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group register and reviews. The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group (CHBG) is one of the 52 collaborative review groups within The Cochrane Collaboration. The activities of the CHBG focus on collecting hepato-biliary randomized clinical trials (RCT) and controlled clinical trials (CCT)  and including them in systematic reviews with meta-analyses of the trials. In this overview  we present the growth of The CHBG Controlled Trials Register  as well as the systematic reviews that have been produced since March 1996. The CHBG register includes almost 11 000 RCT and 700 CCT publications. The earliest RCT in the register were published in 1955  and the earliest CCT in 1945. From 1945 to 1980  there were less than 100 publications each year. From 1981 to 1997  their number increased from over 100 to 600 a year. After 1997  the number of publications seems to have been decreasing. The CHBG has published 199 protocols for systematic reviews and 107 systematic reviews through to August 2009 in which 21% of the RCT and CCT were included. The CHBG reviews have been cited approximately 1200 times. A large amount of work has been carried out since 1996. However  there is still much to do  as the CHBG register contains a great number of RCT and CCT on topics that have not yet been systematically reviewed.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Oral versus intravenous antibiotic therapy for pyelonephritis in the paediatric patient--a survey of a Cochrane review]. Acute pyelonephritis is a common bacterial infection in children. The recommended treatment in Denmark is intravenous ampiciline and gentamycin for at least three days followed by oral antibiotics. The available evidence indicates that oral antibiotics may be as effective as initial intravenous treatment of children with a first attack of pyelonephritis. However  there are no Danish microbiological studies covering broad-spectrum oral antibiotics to children with pyelonephritis. This impedes generalisation to Danish practice.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Campaigns for patient safety and quality improvement - do they work?]. The number of published scientific articles has been increasing for several years. Implementation of evidence-based knowledge in clinical practice is  however  lagging behind. Patient safety campaigns suggest that the implementation of best practice can be accelerated. The Danish Operation Life Campaign is based on rests on a model used in the American 100K Lives Campaign in order to achieve this goal. Campaigns suffer from the inability of the methods to prove a relationship between intervention and results. However  from the patients' point of view  any improvement in quality and safety is a success.
Global Health,,,Global Changes in Food Supply and the Obesity Epidemic. We explore how a global shift in the food system caused by global economic growth  increase in available food per capita and in food processing is a driver of the obesity epidemic. Economic development in most areas of the world has resulted in increased purchasing power and available per capita food. Supermarkets and a growing fast-food industry have transformed our dietary pattern. Ultra-processed food rich on sugars and saturated fat is now the major source of energy in most countries. The shift in food supply is considered a major driver of the obesity epidemic and the increasing prevalence of accompanying complications  such as type 2 diabetes  cardiovascular disease and cancer. However  the global shift might also have direct effects on the increase in type 2 diabetes  cardiovascular disease and cancer  independently of overweight and obesity. The shift in the food supply is a major driver of the obesity epidemic.
Telemedicine,,,Participatory design in health sciences: Using cooperative experimental methods in developing health services and computer technology. Participatory design (PD) is a research approach to the development of technological solutions to real-world problems  an approach that shares many concerns and some of its roots with action research. In this article  the authors discuss their experience in conducting a PD research project intended to develop a technological and a related organizational intervention to support the treatment of foot ulcers for people with diabetes at home. They provide a historical overview of the PD approach and a description of how they used it in their research study. They describe their experience in conducting the research  including the participants' responses  the outcomes of the research  and the challenges confronted in bridging the practical and disciplinary issues that arose. In the conclusion  they propose that PD holds potential as a research approach that might effectively merge computer technology and health-related interventional research.
Otolaryngology,,,Retrospective analysis of use and distribution of resources in otolaryngology wards in Romanian hospitals between 2003 and 2008 to improve provision and financial performance of healthcare services. To analyze use and distribution of resources by otolaryngology (ENT) hospital wards in Romania between 2003 and 2008  in order to plan the improvement of patient access to health care services and health care services' financial performance. Clinical electronic records were searched for all patients discharged from all public hospitals funded on a per-case basis by the government between January 2003 and September 2008. Adult and pediatric ENT wards  as well as ENT wards from different counties  were compared. The number of ENT hospital beds and the number of specialists decreased from 2003 to 2004  the number of specialists declined  and specialists were distributed unevenly among the hospitals and counties. The total number of ENT wards was over 100 for almost the entire study period  but there were only about 15 pediatric ENT wards in all 42 counties. ENT wards recorded more cases and hospitalization days than oral-maxillofacial surgery and neurosurgery wards  but fewer cases than general surgery or obstetrics wards. ENT wards had the lowest mortality rates. Until the second half of 2007  adult ENT wards had a lower surgical index  higher complexity of cases  and longer average length of stay than pediatric ENT wards (P<0.001  t-test). After 2007  pediatric ENT wards treated more complex cases (P=0.004  t -test) that were less surgical in nature; this result was due to the shift from the Health Care Finance Administration classification diagnostic-related group (DRG) system to the Australian Refined DGR system  as well as to improper use of codes. ENT wards in different counties differed in the number of cases  average length of stay  and case mix index. Statistics and case mix clinical data may be a good starting point for informing hospital management to assess ENT service coverage  but they should be supplemented with data on hospitalization costs.
Psychiatry,,,Coercion in psychiatry: the importance of extramural factors. Mechanical restraints and forced procedures in psychiatric wards are of major concern in Denmark and there is a desire to reduce these procedures to a minimum. So far  focus has primarily been on identifying and changing internal (intramural) factors when seeking to reduce coercion. To identify possible external (extramural) factors that may increase the risk of coercion during admission to a closed psychiatric ward. Using a retrospective case-controlled design  235 patients admitted to a closed ward during 2011-2013 were randomly selected. Coercion comprised belt restraint  physical restraint  and forced medication. The data source was the electronic patient records  which include statutory information on all forced measures. Multiple logistic regression analyses were applied to calculate the risk (odds ratio  OR (95% confidence interval)) of forced measures being used. Out of the 235 patients  66 (28%) were subject to coercion. The time of forced procedures was predominately during the first hours after admission. The risk of forced measures being applied was significantly higher if patients were involuntarily admitted (OR = 6.4 (3.4-11.9))  or were acutely intoxicated by substances at the time of admission (OR = 3.7 (1.7-8.2)). Extramural factors should be included when mental health authorities plan efforts to reduce coercion during admission to psychiatric wards. A reduced threshold for admission and improved integrated effort between mental health services and treatment for substance abuse could improve the course of disease for this group of patients and reduce the need for involuntary admissions and subsequently coercion.
Forensic Pathology,,,Petechial hemorrhages of the tympanic membrane in attempted suicide by hanging: A case report. It is important to determine whether a person has been strangulated and the diagnosis is not always straightforward since ligature marks are not always present. In forensic medicine the physical examination recommended is careful inspection of the head and neck region  oral cavity  examination of the eyes including the conjunctiva on both the upper and lower eyelids and photo documentation. Petechial hemorrhages of the conjunctiva are considered marker of life threatening hanging or strangulation. Hemorrhage from ears  perforated tympanic membrane and haematotympanum are scarcely described in case reports of strangulated patients. To our knowledge we are the first to report petechial hemorrhages of the tympanic membrane in a patient following attempted suicide by hanging. We believe that the petechial hemorrhages develop from the capillaries located in lamina propria of the epidermal layer above the fibrous layer. This assumption is made on the basis of our assessment of a normal tympanic membrane with light microscopy. Petechial hemorrhages of the tympanic membrane might in fact be the only sign of life threatening pressure applied to the neck. This is a very important finding and prospective studies should be conducted for further clarification on the matter.
Epidemiology,,,Cigarette smoking and the risk of primary Sjögren's syndrome: a nested case control study. Smoking is reported to affect the risk of a number of chronic disorders  including rheumatic diseases. Previous cross-sectional studies have shown a lower frequency of smoking in patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of smoking and socioeconomic status on the risk of subsequent diagnosis of pSS in a nested case-control study. Participants in two large population-based health surveys who were later diagnosed with pSS were identified through linkage with the Malmö Sjögren's Syndrome Register. Matched controls were obtained from the health surveys. Sixty-three patients with pSS with pre-diagnostic data from the health surveys were identified. Current smoking was associated with a significantly lower risk of later being diagnosed with pSS (odds ratio (OR) 0.3; 95% CI 0.1-0.6). Furthermore  former smoking was associated with an increased risk of subsequent pSS diagnosis (OR 4.0; 95% CI 1.8-8.8) compared to never smoking. Similar results were found in a sub-analysis of patients with reported symptom onset after inclusion in the health surveys. Socioeconomic status and levels of formal education had no significant impact on the risk of later being diagnosed with pSS. In this nested case-control study  current smoking was associated with a reduced risk of subsequent diagnosis of pSS. In addition  former smoking was associated with an increased risk. Whether this reflects a biological effect of cigarette smoking or other mechanisms should be further investigated in future studies.
Epidemiology,,,Societal costs and patients' experience of health inequities before and after diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis: a Danish cohort study. To comprehensively study the comorbidities  healthcare and public transfer (allowance) costs in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) before and after diagnosis. Nationwide cohort study  using data from Danish registries from January 1998 through December 2014. A total of 10 525 patients with PsA and 20 777 matched general population comparator (GPC) subjects were included. Societal costs  employment status and occurrence of comorbidities in patients with PsA both before and after diagnosis were compared with GPC subjects. At baseline  patients with PsA had significantly more comorbidities  including cardiovascular disease (OR 1(.)70 95% CI 1(.)55 to 1(.)86)  respiratory diseases (OR 1(.)73 95% CI 1(.)54 to 1(.)96) and infectious diseases (OR 2(.)03 95% CI 1(.)69 to 2(.)42) compared with GPC subjects. At all time points  patients with PsA had higher total healthcare and public transfer costs; they also had lower income (p<0.001) and incurred a net average increased societal cost of €10 641 per patient-year compared with GPC subjects following diagnosis. The relative risk (RR) for being on disability pension 5 years prior to PsA diagnosis was 1(.)36 (95% CI 1(.)24 to 1(.)49) compared with GPC subjects. The RR increased to 1(.)60 (95% CI 1(.)49 to 1(.)72) at the time of diagnosis and was 2(.)69 (95% CI 2(.)40 to 3(.)02) 10 years after diagnosis  where 21(.)8% of the patients with PsA received disability pension. Our findings are suggestive of health inequity for patients with PsA and call for individual preventive measures and societal action.
Pediatrics,,,Danish clinical guidelines for examination and treatment of overweight and obese children and adolescents in a pediatric setting. Overweight children are at an increased risk of becoming obese adults  which may lead to shorter life expectancies in the current generation of children as compared to their parents. Furthermore  being an overweight child has a negative psycho-social impact. We consider obesity in children and adolescents a chronic illness  which is in line with the American Medical Society. We summarize the evidence for the efficacy of a combination of diet  physical activity and behavior-focused interventions in a family-based setting. The present guidelines propose a multidisciplinary service implemented as a "chronic care model" based on "best clinical practice" inspired by an American expert committee and the daily practice of The Children's Obesity Clinic at Copenhagen University Hospital Holbaek. Children and adolescents should be referred for examination and treatment in a pediatric setting when BMI corresponds to an isoBMI of minimum 30 or BMI corresponds to an isoBMI of 25 and complex obesity is suspected. Obtaining a thorough medical history is pivotal. We propose a structured interview to ensure collection of all relevant information. We recommend physical examination focused on BMI  waist circumference  growth  pubertal stage  blood pressure  neurology and skin and provide comprehensive paraclinical investigations for obesity and obesity related conditions. Treatment of obesity in children and adolescents is fully dependent on the combined effort of the entire family. This cannot be overemphasized! The main principle of the treatment is developing an individual detailed plan for every patient to reduce caloric intake whilst increasing physical activity  leaving no ambiguity with the recommendations.
Serology,,,Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus in infants study (IRIS) of hospitalized and non-ill infants aged <1 year in four countries: study design and methods. This multi-country prospective study of infants aged <1 year aims to assess the frequency of influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections associated with hospitalizations  to describe clinical features and antibody response to infection  and to examine predictors of very severe disease requiring intensive care. We are enrolling a hospital-based cohort and a sample of non-ill infants in four countries (Albania  Jordan  Nicaragua  and the Philippines) using a common protocol. We are currently starting year 2 of a 2- to 3-year study and will enroll approximately 3 000 infants hospitalized for any acute illness (respiratory or non-respiratory) during periods of local influenza and/or RSV circulation. After informed consent and within 24 h of admission  we collect blood and respiratory specimens and conduct an interview to assess socio-demographic characteristics  medical history  and symptoms of acute illness (onset ≤10 days). Vital signs  interventions  and medications are documented daily through medical record abstraction. A follow-up health assessment and collection of convalescent blood occurs 3-5 weeks after enrollment. Influenza and RSV infection is confirmed by singleplex real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays. Serologic conversion will be assessed comparing acute and convalescent sera using hemagglutination inhibition assay for influenza antibodies and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for RSV. Concurrent with hospital-based enrollment  respiratory specimens are also being collected (and tested by rRT-PCR) from approximately 1 400 non-ill infants aged <1 year during routine medical or preventive care. The Influenza and RSV in Infants Study (IRIS) promises to expand our knowledge of the frequency  clinical features  and antibody profiles of serious influenza and RSV disease among infants aged <1 year  quantify the proportion of infections that may be missed by traditional surveillance  and inform decisions about the potential value of existing and new vaccines and other prevention and treatment strategies.
Psychiatry,,,Increased risk of antidepressant use in childhood cancer survivors: a Danish population-based cohort study. Childhood cancer survivors are at risk of both somatic and mental late effects  but large population-based studies of depression are lacking. Risk of antidepressant use was evaluated in a population-based cohort of 5452 Danish children treated for cancer in 1975-2009 by linkage to the National Prescription Drug Database  which worldwide is the oldest nationwide registry of prescription medication. Hazard ratios (HRs) for antidepressant use were estimated in a Cox proportional hazards model stratified on sex  with population comparisons as referents. Overall  childhood cancer survivors were at increased risk of having antidepressants prescribed (HR  1.4; 95% confidence interval (CI)  1.3-1.5). The excess absolute risk of antidepressant use was 2.5 per 1000 person-years (95% CI  1.7-3.3)  equivalent to an excess of 2.5 survivors for every 100 survivors followed for 10years. Increased HRs of 30-50% were seen for survivors of cancers of all main groups (haematological malignancies  central nervous system (CNS) and solid tumors); the highest risk was among children treated with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HR  1.9; 95% CI  1.2-3.1). Our data suggested that the risk was most pronounced for children treated in the most recent calendar periods (test for interaction between cancer and calendar periods: P<0.001)  especially for survivors of haematological cancers (P=0.007). Interaction analysis of the effect of parental socioeconomic position and psychiatric disease on the association between childhood cancer and antidepressant use indicated no modifying effect. Childhood cancer survivors should be followed-up for depression. Our results indicate an increasing need for follow-up especially in survivors treated by more recent  intensive anticancer treatment.
Internal Medicine,,,[Selected acute admission to a medical department]. The aim of the study was to describe the pattern of admissions to a medical department and to analyse whether acute admissions can be referred to hospitals with limited access to acute medical and surgical assistance and limited access to intensive care. All acute admissions to the medical department during a three-week period were registered. The medical officer in charge of the distribution of patients filled in a questionnaire at the time of telephone contact with the referring physician concerning the feasibility of referral to a medical department with limited access to acute assistance. Out of 113 patients judged suitable for referral to a hospital with limited access to acute assistance  60% had or developed conditions judged to require hospitals with a specialised level of acute services. Contact with a medical officer by telephone seems to be an unsuitable way of selecting which patients do not need highly specialized medical assistance  surgical assistance or intensive care.
General Practice,,,Prevalence of sexual desire and satisfaction among patients with screen-detected diabetes and impact of intensive multifactorial treatment: results from the ADDITION-Denmark study. Sexual problems are common in people with diabetes. It is unknown whether early detection of diabetes and subsequent intensive multifactorial treatment (IT) are associated with sexual health. We report the prevalence of low sexual desire and low sexual satisfaction among people with screen-detected diabetes and compare the impact of intensive multifactorial treatment with the impact of routine care (RC) on these measures. A cross-sectional analysis of the ADDITION-Denmark trial cohort six years post-diagnosis. 190 general practices around Denmark. A total of 968 patients with screen-detected type 2 diabetes. Low sexual desire and low sexual satisfaction. Mean (standard deviation  SD) age was 64.9 (6.9) years. The prevalence of low sexual desire was 53% (RC) and 54% (IT) among women  and 24% (RC) and 25% (IT) among men. The prevalence of low sexual satisfaction was 23% (RC) and 18% (IT) among women  and 27% (RC) and 37% (IT) among men. Among men  the prevalence of low sexual satisfaction was significantly higher in the IT group than in the RC group  p = 0.01. Low sexual desire and low satisfaction are frequent among men and women with screen-detected diabetes  and IT may negatively impact men's sexual satisfaction.
Internal Medicine,,,Repeated measurements of generic indicators: a Danish national program to benchmark and improve quality of care. To measure performance on the basis of generic (non-diagnoses related) standards of care developed in a national Danish quality improvement programme in departments of internal medicine  and to determine the power of repetitive national audits to increase levels of performance. Multifaceted intervention: national audits in 2001 and 2002 based on the standards of the program  combined with direct contact with heads of departments and a national conference to discuss audit results. Seventy-nine and 82 wards in 2001 and 2002  respectively  covering 71% of Danish hospitals receiving medical emergencies. The wards participated on a voluntary basis. In the first audit round  3950 patients were admitted as emergencies  while 4068 patients were admitted as emergencies in the second audit. Patients were included without reference to diagnoses. Correct initial diagnostic assessment  early interdisciplinary action plans  correct drug prescriptions  waiting times for examinations  documented patient information  readmissions  and content and processing time for discharge letters. For the 70 wards participating in both rounds  the general level of performance improved significantly between the two audits: the proportion of patients with correct initial diagnostic assessment increased from 75.9% to 79.4%  the proportion of patients with correct drug prescriptions increased from 83.8% to 85.9%  and the proportion of sufficiently informed patients increased from 32.4% to 36.2% (P < 0.05). The proportion of medical records containing action plans for selected clinical problems (nutritional and functional problems  fever  and treatment of pain) increased from 72.8% to 75.9% (P < 0.05). Length of stay in hospital was significantly related to a correct initial assessment and to waiting time for examinations. Wards with a common medication chart for physicians and nurses had significantly more correct drug prescriptions than wards that did not use a medication chart. Fifty-four (75%) of the participating departments indicated that the result of the first audit round had led to organizational changes in the department. Professional self-regulation guided by a multidisciplinary audit tool developed in cooperation with professionals can improve quality of care. It is possible to conduct and repeat a national audit on a voluntary basis.
Internal Medicine,,,[The Good Medical Department. Results from a national survey of quality in 1998]. This cross-sectional study describes quality related data from 39 medical wards in Denmark. The study is based on a review of 1517 medical records and a short patient interview. The medical departments took part voluntarily in the study  which was initiated by the Danish Society for Internal Medicine. A total of 23 quality-related indicators related to the planning of the treatment  documentation in patient records  and care were registered. The day before the data collection was an inactive inpatient day for 22.8 +/- 1.1% of patients. Allergy was insufficiently documented in the medical record for 18.8 +/- 1.0% of patients. Weight was not documented in 48.8 +/- 1.3% of patients. Considerations about anticoagulation treatment of atrial fibrillation were not documented in 50.1 +/- 3.6% of patients with atrial fibrillation. This study indicates that it is possible on a voluntary basis to collect and distribute quality-related data. The survey has recently been repeated with a modified data registration sheet.
Stroke Rehabilitation,,,Rehabilitation of the hemiparetic gait by nociceptive withdrawal reflex-based functional electrical therapy: a randomized  single-blinded study. Gait deficits are very common after stroke and improved therapeutic interventions are needed. The objective of this study was therefore to investigate the therapeutic use of the nociceptive withdrawal reflex to support gait training in the subacute post-stroke phase. Individuals were randomly allocated to a treatment group that received physiotherapy-based gait training supported by withdrawal reflex stimulation and a control group that received physiotherapy-based gait training alone. Electrical stimuli delivered to the arch of the foot elicited the withdrawal reflex at heel-off with the purpose of facilitating the initiation and execution of the swing phase. Gait was assessed before and immediately after finishing treatment  and one month and six months after finishing treatment. Assessments included the Functional Ambulation Category (FAC) test  the preferred and maximum gait velocities  the duration of the stance phase in the hemiparetic side  the duration of the gait cycle  and the stance time symmetry ratio. The treatment group showed an improved post treatment preferred walking velocity (p < 0.001) and fast walking velocity (p < 0.001) compared to the control group. Furthermore  subjects in the treatment group with severe walking impairment at inclusion time showed the best improvement as assessed by a longer duration of the stance phase in the hemiparetic side (p < 0.002) and a shorter duration of the gait cycle (p < 0.002). The stance time symmetry ratio was significantly better for the treatment than the control group after finishing training (p < 0.02). No differences between groups were detected with the FAC test after finishing training (p = 0.09). Withdrawal reflex-based functional electrical therapy was useful in the rehabilitation of the hemiparetic gait of severely impaired patients.
Epidemiology,Reproductive Medicine,,In utero exposure to alcohol and puberty in boys: a pregnancy cohort study. Epidemiological studies have raised concerns about the reproductive consequences of in utero exposure to alcohol. Maternal lifestyle factors have been associated with altered pubertal development  but the impact of prenatal alcohol exposure on male puberty is unknown. Thus  the objective was to explore whether prenatal alcohol exposure alters pubertal development in boys. Follow-up of a Danish pregnancy cohort. Sons (N=2522) of women who were enrolled in a Danish pregnancy cohort between 1984 and 1987. Indicators of pubertal development  assessed by age at first nocturnal emission  voice break  acne and regular shaving. We found a tendency towards a later age at first nocturnal emission and voice break following in utero exposure to binge drinking. Boys exposed to ≥5 binge drinking episodes during pregnancy experienced their first nocturnal emission 7.3 months (95% CI -2.8 to 17.4) later and voice break 4.9 months (95% CI -0.6 to 10.4) later than the unexposed boys. Results for average weekly alcohol consumption were in the same direction  but differences were smaller and not statistically significant. We found no strong support for the hypothesis that in utero exposure to weekly alcohol consumption is a risk factor for altered pubertal development  but a tendency towards delayed pubertal development among boys exposed to binge drinking during fetal life was observed. Longitudinal studies  with data collected as children go through puberty  are needed to explore this further.
Geriatric Nursing,,,Differences between day and nonday workers in exposure to physical and psychosocial work factors in the Danish eldercare sector. The possible interaction between individual and occupational risk factors  the need for meaningful intervention  and the demand for valid shift work research make the accumulation of adverse exposures at certain times of the day of special relevance with respect to occupational health. The aim of the present study was therefore to examine whether there was a clustering of detrimental work factors among female eldercare workers in fixed evening or fixed night shifts when they are compared with workers in fixed day shifts. This cross-sectional  questionnaire-based study was conducted among 4590 female health care workers in the Danish eldercare sector. The participants worked in nursing homes  in home care  or in both. They answered questions on job demands  job control  and social support  together with questions on physical and psychological violence  physical workload  and passive smoking. We found that-compared with day workers-fixed nonday workers were more exposed to low job control  low support from leaders  physical and psychological violence  and high physical demands. Nonday workers were  however  less exposed to high demands. These differences remained after control for age  job title  and workplace. Exposures in the work environment of Danish eldercare workers varied between shifts. In a research perspective these findings stress the importance of adequate adjustment for work factors when the health effects of shift work are studied. Moreover  the results underscore the need for an increased awareness of work factors of special importance among nonday workers when interventions against shiftwork-related occupational disorders are designed.
Nursing Administration Research,,,Data warehouse approach to nursing management. This article describes a data warehouse approach when designing an information system to meet nursing management needs in acute hospital setting. The rapidly changing health care environment has created new challenges for nursing leaders and requires appropriate  accurate and timely data for decision-making. Key aspects of current information needs were identified by a nursing expert group. A data warehouse-based Nursing Management Information System was produced and piloted in nine wards. A survey and interviews were conducted to evaluate the piloting. Data from the patient administrative system together with nursing rostering data and measures for nursing care intensity brought new opportunities for nursing management. A Nursing Management Information System is suggested to be built using data warehouse model. Successful implementation of a Nursing Management Information System requires systematic data quality checks. An information analyst is essential for interpreting and communicating nursing data to multi-professional management groups.
Family Practice,,,[Allergy in general practice in Arhus County. Quality assessment of diagnosis  treatment and instructions to patients. III. Allergy testing]. The aim of this study was to compare the allergy test with the skin prick test and the specific IgE by Phadiatop test to a purely clinical allergy diagnosis by an allergy specialist in adult patients previously tested in general practice. A total of 103 patients suspected of having asthma and/or rhinitis were re-evaluated with a clinical diagnosis and the two allergy tests. Both the patient and the individual general practitioner were asked about existing allergy diagnosis. The two test systems showed large differences in a semiquantitative linear system with an explained variation (r2) of only 8%. In comparison to a purely clinical diagnosis  they were diagnostically equal with both tests  with an additional 15% positive reactions of which 25% were judged clinically active. Both tests resulted in about 33% false-positive tests classified as clinically inactive. In the case of a positive Phadiatop test and clinically active allergy  both the patient and the general practitioner reported identical specialist diagnoses in about 75% of cases  while in 20-50% of the cases an identical diagnosis was reported when the clinical diagnosis was qualitatively different from the result of Phadiatop. The results of the two test systems often differ  and they both detect extra positive tests  in which case they should be used in a serial manner. Both tests often result in a false-positive diagnosis  and identification of clinically relevant positive tests often requires an experienced medical evaluation.
Family Practice,,,[Allergy in general practice in Arhus County. Quality assessment of diagnosis  treatment and instructions to patients: II. Rhinitis]. The aim of this study was to evaluate adult patients in general practice suspected of having rhinitis. A total of 72 patients suspected of having rhinitis underwent a secondary specialist investigation  resulting in 55 final specialist diagnoses of rhinitis. Through interviews of patients and a questionnaire mailed to the primary physician  information on diagnostic strategy  final diagnosis  suggested treatments and patients' knowledge about rhinitis were determined. One third of the 72 patients examined for possible rhinitis would have benefited from a supplementary specialist examination  where one group was made up of patients with negative allergy tests and chronic symptoms of either non-rhinitis disease or vasomotoric rhinitis and the other group was made up of patients with severe seasonal allergic rhinitis  who would benefit from immunotherapy. The suggested medical treatments followed modern treatment principles. Of the patients with a final diagnosis of rhinitis  only one third were informed about treatment principles with inhalation steroids  while half of the patients knew about the basic principles of antihistamine treatment. Of 53 patients with rhinitis  6 were prepared to change medical treatment without first contacting their physician. Patients with chronic or recurrent symptoms should be referred to specialists more often  and patients who might benefit from allergen-specific treatment  such as immunotherapy or allergen prevention  should be evaluated by an allergy specialist. Patients with rhinitis should be given more information on disease mechanisms and treatment principles.
Family Practice,,,[Allergy in general practice in Arhus County. Quality assessment of diagnosis  treatment and instructions to patients: I. Asthma]. The aim of this study was to evaluate adult patients examined in general practice on suspicion of having asthma. A total of 46 patients suspected of having asthma underwent a second specialist investigation  which demonstrated that 28 of them had asthma. Through interviews of patients and a questionnaire completed by the primary physician  information on diagnostic strategy  general practice diagnosis  suggested treatments and patients' knowledge about asthma was determined. In 65% of the patients investigated for possible asthma in general practice  the specialist examination did not provide any major suggestions for changes  while one in every three patients would have benefited from a secondary specialist examination. The largest group was 7 of 18 patients who did not have asthma but who suffered from chronic or recurrent symptoms. Also  one in four of the patients with a final diagnosis of asthma would have benefited from a specialist examination because of uncertain diagnosis  disease severity and/or the possibility of allergen-specific treatment. The medical treatments suggested by the general practitioners followed modern treatment principles. Just over half of the patients with a final specialist diagnosis of asthma were familiar with the basic disease mechanisms  but only 7% of them would change their therapy in relation to disease severity without first contacting their physicians. Patients with chronic or recurrent symptoms should be referred to specialists more often  and patients who could potentially benefit from allergen-specific treatment  such as allergen prevention  should be evaluated by an allergy specialist. There is a need for increased patient education.
Epidemiology,,,Readmission and mortality in patients discharged with a diagnosis of medical observation and evaluation (Z03*-codes) from an acute admission unit in Denmark: a prospective cohort study. We assessed the 30-day risk of readmission and mortality among patients receiving an International Classification of Diseases 10th edition diagnosis of medical observation and evaluation (Z03*) following admission to an acute medical admission unit (AMAU)  stratified on any further specification of diagnosis during hospital stay. We used Central Denmark's (Midt)-Electronic Patient Journal to identify patients with a Z03*-diagnosis among patients admitted to the AMAU  Aarhus University Hospital Nørrebrogade from April 2012 to March 2013  and noted any specification of diagnosis. Patients were followed from hospital discharge until death  emigration  or completion of 30 days follow-up. Of 409 patients with an initial Z03* diagnosis at the AMAU  55% (n = 226) received a more specific discharge diagnosis after transferral to other departments. Among patients discharged to home with a Z03*-diagnosis  30% were readmitted within 30 days  while the corresponding figure was 23% for patients receiving a specific diagnosis (p = 0.06). In contrast  corresponding figures for 30-day mortality were 3% for Z03*-diagnosed patients and 10% for those who obtained a specific diagnosis (p = 0.003). Patients diagnosed with Z03* at hospital discharge have a substantially lower 30-day mortality  but a higher readmission-rate  compared to patients who obtain a specific diagnosis during the entire hospital stay.
Telemedicine,,,Geographic information system data from ambulances applied in the emergency department: effects on patient reception. Emergency departments (ED) recognize crowding and handover from prehospital to in-hospital settings to be major challenges. Prehospital Geographical Information Systems (GIS) may be a promising tool to address such issues. In this study  the use of prehospital GIS data was implemented in an ED in order to investigate its effect on 1) wait time and unprepared activations of Trauma Teams (TT) and Medical Emergency Teams (MET) and 2) nurses' perceptions regarding patient reception  workflow and resource utilization.  From May 1st 2014 to October 31th 2014  GIS data was displayed in the ED. Data included real-time estimated time of arrival  distance to ED  dispatch criteria  patient data and ambulance contact information. Data was used by coordinating nurses for time activation of TT and MET involved in the initial treatment of severely-injured or critically-ill patients. In addition  it was used as a logistics tool for handling all other patients transported by ambulance to the ED. The study followed a mixed-methods design  consisting of a quantitative study (before and after intervention) and a qualitative study (survey and interviews). Participants included all patients received by TT or MET and coordinating nurses in the ED. 1.) Quantitative: 599 patients were included. The median wait time for TT and MET was 5 min both before and after the GIS intervention  showing no difference (p = 0.18). A significant reduction in the subgroup of waits >10 min was found (p < 0.05). No difference was found in unprepared TT and MET activations. 2.) Qualitative: Nurses perceived GIS data as a tool to optimize resource utilization and quality of all patients' reception  critically or non-critically ill. No substantial disadvantages were reported. The contradiction of measured median wait time and nurses perceived improved timing of team activation may result from having both RT- ETA and supplemental patient information not only for seriously-injured or critically-ill patients received by the TT and MET  but for all patients transported by ambulance. The reduction in waits > 10 minutes may have contributed to the overall perception of reduced wait time  as avoidance of long waits is clinically more important than reduction in the median wait time. A comparison of the use of prehospital GIS data in the ED with the control period showed no effect on median wait time for TT and MET  however  the number of waits of >10 min was reduced. On the other hand  nurses perceived implementation of GIS data as improving workflow  resource utilization and quality of all patients' reception  critically as well as non-critically ill. There were no substantial disadvantages to the GIS application. ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02188966).
Epidemiology,,,Completeness and validity in a national clinical thyroid cancer database: DATHYRCA. Although a prospective national clinical thyroid cancer database (DATHYRCA) has been active in Denmark since January 1  1996  no assessment of data quality has been performed. The purpose of the study was to evaluate completeness and data validity in the Danish national clinical thyroid cancer database: DATHYRCA. National prospective cohort. Denmark; population 5.5 million. Completeness of case ascertainment was estimated by the independent case ascertainment method using three governmental registries as a reference. The reabstracted record method was used to appraise the validity. For validity assessment 100 cases were randomly selected from the DATHYRCA database; medical records were used as a reference. The database held 1934 cases of thyroid carcinoma and completeness of case ascertainment was estimated to 90.9%. Completeness of registration was around or above 90% in most instances. Perfect agreement on the diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma was found  both inter- and intra-observer  and κ values of selected variables showed overall good to excellent agreement. In a setup with public health insurance  personal identity numbers and extended governmental databases  it is possible to establish national clinical cancer databases with a satisfactory completeness and validity. The DATHYRCA database is considered reliable in terms of describing thyroid carcinoma at a national level.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Guidelines for treatment of overweight/obesity  2006]. Guidelines for evaluation and treatment of overweight and obesity in adults in Denmark are given. These guidelines are evidence-based and are similar to international guidelines.
General Practice,Medical Oncology,,Shared care is a model for patients with stable prostate cancer. Patients with prostate cancer (PC) have so far been followed in specialised hospital departments after diagnosis and initiation of treatment. The main obstacles associated with the transfer of this activity to general practice include lack of experience and uncertainty as to whether general practitioners (GPs) can handle follow-up. A Steering Committee was established in collaboration with health-care professionals to devise a strategy for a shared care model. An action plan was designed that included 1) the development of a shared care model for follow-up and treatment  2) implementation of the shared care model in cooperation between the parties involved  3) design of procedures for re-referral  and 4) evaluation of effect  change processes and contextual factors. A total of 2 585 patients with PC were included in the study: 1 172 had disseminated disease  754 had no recurrence after curative treatment  244 who had been treated with a curative intent were being treated for relapse  186 underwent watchful waiting  135 underwent active surveillance  while other scenarios applied in the remaining 94 cases. A total of 530 patients were transferred to follow-up with a GP and 2 055 were not transferred to their GP. The main reason why patients were considered not suitable for transfer to primary health care was the patients' own desire (33%)  followed by clinical or biochemical disease progression (33%). The evaluation found that 96% of the patients were very comfortable with the permanent or temporary closure of the hospital course. The project focused on factors that are essential for the successful transfer of responsibility for long-term follow-up of patients with prostate cancer. Patient transfer succeeded with high initial patient satisfaction. not relevant. not relevant.
Medical Laboratory Science,,,[Development of an Internet search strategy to identify new medical technologies in prostate cancer]. Technological change is rapid in medicine. The Internet is becoming more and more important as a source of keeping abreast of technological change  but tools to aid clinicians in finding relevant information on the Internet are lacking. The objective of this project was to develop an Internet search strategy to identify new technologies for the treatment of localised prostate cancer. Web sites were found by means of a literature search and by searching specific Internet sources. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were developed based on literature and applied to a variety of potentially relevant sites. An initial strategy was developed  technologies identified  and the novelty and relevance were assessed by urologists in the team. This information was used to adjust the strategy. 6 general urologists assessed the efficiency of the strategy. Their input was used to define a final listing of sites. The strategy consists of 10 sites which should be visited in the following order: YahooHealth  DoctorsGuide  The National Electronic Library for Medicines  CancerPage  Medscape  MedlinePlus  HealthAndAge  CancerConsultants  EurekAlert  Oncolink. Links to the exact sites are provided at www.ugeskriftet.dk. This study resulted in an Internet search strategy to identify new medical technologies for a well-defined indication. The methods used may be useful in order to develop similar strategies in other clinical areas in urology or other specialties.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Dietary carbohydrate restriction as the first approach in diabetes management: critical review and evidence base. The inability of current recommendations to control the epidemic of diabetes  the specific failure of the prevailing low-fat diets to improve obesity  cardiovascular risk  or general health and the persistent reports of some serious side effects of commonly prescribed diabetic medications  in combination with the continued success of low-carbohydrate diets in the treatment of diabetes and metabolic syndrome without significant side effects  point to the need for a reappraisal of dietary guidelines. The benefits of carbohydrate restriction in diabetes are immediate and well documented. Concerns about the efficacy and safety are long term and conjectural rather than data driven. Dietary carbohydrate restriction reliably reduces high blood glucose  does not require weight loss (although is still best for weight loss)  and leads to the reduction or elimination of medication. It has never shown side effects comparable with those seen in many drugs. Here we present 12 points of evidence supporting the use of low-carbohydrate diets as the first approach to treating type 2 diabetes and as the most effective adjunct to pharmacology in type 1. They represent the best-documented  least controversial results. The insistence on long-term randomized controlled trials as the only kind of data that will be accepted is without precedent in science. The seriousness of diabetes requires that we evaluate all of the evidence that is available. The 12 points are sufficiently compelling that we feel that the burden of proof rests with those who are opposed.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Optimizing 131I uptake after rhTSH stimulation in patients with nontoxic multinodular goiter: evidence from a prospective  randomized  double-blind study. Prestimulation with recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone (rhTSH) augments radioiodine (131)I therapy for benign nontoxic multinodular goiter. The purpose of this study was to determine the optimal time interval between rhTSH and (131)I administration to enhance thyroid radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU). Patients were randomized  in a 2-factorial design  to receive either a 0.1-mg dose of rhTSH (n = 60) or placebo (n = 30) and to a time interval of 24  48  or 72 h before (131)I administration. The rhTSH- or placebo-stimulated RAIU study was performed at 4 wk after a baseline RAIU assessment in a tertiary referral center at a university hospital. A total of 90 patients (78 women; median age  52 y; range  22-83 y) referred to (131)I therapy for symptomatic nontoxic goiter (median goiter volume  63 mL; range  25-464 mL) were included in the study. Change in thyroid RAIU was determined at 24 and 96 h after (131)I tracer administration. In the placebo subgroups  RAIU did not change significantly from baseline. The mean (+/-SE) 24-h RAIU increased from 33.8% +/- 2.3% to 66.0% +/- 1.8% (111.2% increase) with a 24-h interval  from 36.8% +/- 2.1% to 64.6% +/- 2.7% (83.3% increase) with a 48-h interval  and from 33.0% +/- 2.7% to 49.6% +/- 2.5% (62.4% increase) with a 72-h interval. All within-group changes were highly significant (P < 0.001). The effect was negatively correlated with initial RAIU (r = -0.703  P < 0.001). The increase in 24- and 96-h RAIU was significantly higher in the rhTSH/24-h group than it was in the rhTSH/72-h group (P = 0.023 and 0.012  respectively) and insignificantly higher than in the rhTSH/48-h group (P = 0.37 and 0.26  respectively). The effect of rhTSH on thyroid RAIU is most pronounced when administered 24 h before (131)I administration and declines with longer time intervals. Whether there is a similar time dependency for goiter reduction after rhTSH-stimulated (131)I-therapy remains to be clarified.
Epidemiology,,,Negative affect is associated with development and persistence of chemical intolerance: a prospective population-based study. Chemical intolerance (CI) is characterised by negative health effects attributed to a heightened responsiveness to common airborne chemicals. This longitudinal study explored the hypothesised role of negative affect in the development and persistence of CI in a general population. A general population sample aged 19 to 72 years was examined in 2006-2008 and again in 2011-2012. Longitudinal data on CI were analysed with the purpose of examining baseline negative affect as a risk factor for having developed CI at 5-year follow-up and for reporting persistent CI. Participants were classified as reporting no signs of CI  having symptoms of CI and as being a likely CI case based on self-reported reactions to 11 common chemical exposures  symptoms related to chemical exposures and daily life adjustments attributed to reactions when exposed to chemicals. A total of 69.4% of the participants who had reported CI at baseline also reported CI at follow-up. In participants with no baseline CI  15.5% reported CI at follow-up and 18.1% reported symptoms related to chemicals but no daily life adjustments. Baseline negative affect was positively and statistically significantly associated with both development and persistence of CI. Initial reports of CI were found to be persistent over time  and a considerable proportion of the participants with no CI at baseline reported having developed CI after 5 years. The positive association between negative affect and CI at the 5-year follow-up supports negative affect as a possible risk factor for CI.
Pediatrics,,,The impact of legislation on drug substances used off-label in paediatric wards--a nationwide study. This nationwide study is aimed at describing to what extent the European Paediatric Regulation has met therapeutic needs in children. Data for each drug substance in defined daily doses (DDD) were extracted from the national Danish data base. We evaluated if drug substances were used off-label and whether they had a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). This study did not include drug prescriptions for individual paediatric patients; thus  it was not possible to make use of all off-label categories previously used. Additionally  paediatric standard assortments (SA) were compared to the European survey on paediatric medicinal products. Thirteen percent of the 100 most used drug substances were determined as being used off-label  four of which had a PIP and one had a full waiver. Only one of the three drug substances used off-label most often  accounting for 85 % of such use  had a PIP. Neonates were included in one-third of PIPs and adolescents in 15. Nineteen out of 21 PIPs had a waiver and 14 PIPs were deferred. In line with the European survey  carbapenems  corticosteroids and proton pump inhibitors were frequent found in SAs. PIPs only cover a small proportion of the drugs found to be used off-label in this study. Despite waivers granted  drug substances were used nonetheless. Unmet regulatory needs are still considerable in some therapeutic areas in neonates as well as in children.
Clinical Medicine,,,Pyogenic brain abscess  a 15 year survey. Brain abscess is a potentially fatal disease. This study assesses clinical aspects of brain abscess in a large hospital cohort. Retrospective review of adult patients with pyogenic brain abscess at Rigshospitalet University Hospital  Denmark between 1994 and 2009. Prognostic factors associated with Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) (death  severe disability or vegetative state) were assessed by logistic regression. 102 patients were included. On admission  only 20% of patients had a triad of fever  headache and nausea  39% had no fever  26% had normal CRP and 49% had no leucocytosis. Median delay from symptom onset to antibiotic treatment was 7 days (range 0-97 days). Source of infection was contiguous in 36%  haematogenous in 28%  surgical or traumatic in 9% and unknown in 27% of cases. Abscess location did not accurately predict the portal of entry. 67% were treated by burr hole aspiration  20% by craniotomy and 13% by antibiotics alone. Median duration of antibiotic treatment was 62 days. No cases of recurrent abscess were observed. At discharge 23% had GOS ≤3. The 1-  3- and 12-month mortality was 11%  17% and 19%. Adverse outcome was associated with a low GCS at admission  presence of comorbidities and intraventricular rupture of abscess. The clinical signs of brain abscess are unspecific  many patients presented without clear signs of infection and diagnosis and treatment were often delayed. Decreased GCS  presence of comorbidities and intraventricular rupture of brain abscess were associated with poor outcome. Brain abscess remains associated with considerable morbidity and mortality.
Pharmacoepidemiology,,,Antiepileptic drugs and risk of suicide: a nationwide study. Patients with epilepsy or psychiatric diseases have increased risk of suicide  but whether the risk is influenced by antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment is unclear. Studies have suggested that AEDs in general increase the risk of suicidal behaviour shortly after initiation. This study investigated possible differences in suicide risk associated with different AEDs. The use of AEDs in the Danish population from 1997 to 2006 was determined by prescription claims. The risk of suicide associated with use of AEDs was estimated by case-crossover analyses  where each case serves at its own control during different periods. For sensitivity  the risk of suicide was estimated by a time-dependent Cox proportional-hazard analysis in AED treatment-naïve patients. There were 6780 cases committing suicide in the 10-year study period  of which 422 received AED treatment at the time of suicide. The case-crossover analysis estimated AED treatment initiation to increase the risk of suicide (odds ratio (OR): 1.84  95% confidence interval (CI): 1.36-2.49). Clonazepam (OR: 2.01  CI: 1.25-3.25)  valproate (OR: 2.08  CI: 1.04-4.16)  lamotrigine (OR: 3.15  CI: 1.35-7.34) and phenobarbital (OR: 1.96  CI: 1.02-3.75) were associated with a significant increased risk  while the remaining examined AEDs did not significantly influence the risk. In the cohort comprising of 169 725 AED treatment-naïve patients  the Cox proportional-hazard analysis yielded similar results. This study suggests that clonazepam  valproate  lamotrigine and phenobarbital relatively shortly after treatment initiation may increase the risk of suicide. The increased risk of suicide associated with these AEDs appears to be a consistent finding.
Rheumatology,,,Feasibility of a standardized ultrasound examination in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: a quality improvement among rheumatologists cohort. Quality improvement is important to facilitate valid patient outcomes. Standardized examination procedures may improve the validity of US.The aim of this study was to investigate the learning progress for rheumatologists during training of US examination of the hand in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Rheumatologists with varying degrees of experience in US were instructed by skilled tutors. The program consisted of two days with hands-on training followed by personal US examinations performed in their individual clinics. Examinations were sent to the tutors for quality control. The US examinations were evaluated according to a scoring sheet containing 144 items. An acceptable examination was defined as > 80% correct scores. Thirteen rheumatologists participated in the study. They included a total of 104 patients with RA. Only few of the initial examinations were scored below 80%  and as experience increased  the scores improved (p = 0.0004). A few participants displayed decreasing scores.The mean time spent performing the standardized examination procedure decreased from 34 min to less than 10 minutes (p = 0.0001). With systematic hands-on training  a rheumatologist can achieve a high level of proficiency in the conduction of US examinations of the joints of the hand in patients with RA. With experience  examination time decreases  while the level of correctness is maintained. The results indicate that US may be applied as a valid measurement tool suitable for clinical practice and in both single- and multi-centre trials.
Orthopedics,,,The use of computer-assisted surgery as an educational tool for the training of orthopedic surgery residents in pedicle screw placement: a pilot study and survey among orthopedic residents. The training of orthopedic residents in adequate pedicle screw placement is very important. We sought to investigate orthopedic residents' perspectives on the use of computer-assisted surgery (CAS) in a training trial. Orthopedic residents were randomly assigned to independently place a screw using the free-hand technique and the CAS technique on 1 of 3 cadavers (Cobb angles 5º  15º and 67º) at randomly selected thoracolumbar vertebral levels. All residents were blinded to their colleagues' pedicle screw placements and were asked to complete a short questionnaire at the end of the session to evaluate their experience with CAS. We obtained CT images for each cadaver to assess pedicle screw placement accuracy and classified placement as A) screw completely in pedicle  B) screw < 2 mm outside pedicle  C) screw 2-4 mm outside pedicle  or D) screw > 4 mm outside pedicle. Twenty-four orthopedic residents participated in this trial study. In total  65% preferred using the free-hand technique in an educational setting even though most (60%) said that CAS is safer. The main reason for free-hand technique preference was the difficult technical aspects encountered with CAS. In addition  accuracy of pedicle screw placement in this trial showed that 5 screws were classified as A or B (safe zone) and 19 as grade C or D (unsafe zone) using the free-hand technique compared with 15 and 9  respectively  using CAS (p = 0.008). Orthopedic residents perceived CAS as safe and demonstrated improved accuracy in pedicle screw placement in a single setting. However  the residents preferred the free-hand technique in an educational stetting owing to the difficult technical aspects of CAS. Il est très important d’apprendre aux médecins résidents en chirurgie orthopédique comment positionner adéquatement une vis pédiculaire. Notre objectif était d’obtenir l’opinion des médecins résidents sur le recours à la chirurgie assistée par ordinateur (CAO) dans un essai sur la formation. Des médecins résidents en chirurgie orthopédique répartis aléatoirement ont placé indépendamment une vis à l’aide d’une technique à main libre basée sur les repères topographiques et la palpation  et de la CAO dans 1 de 3 cadavres (angles de Cobb de 5°  15° et 67°) dans une vertèbre dorsolombaire sélectionnée aléatoirement. Aucun des médecins résidents n’a pu observer le positionnement de la vis de ses collègues  et les participants ont rempli un court questionnaire à la fin de la séance pour évaluer leur expérience de la CAO. Nous avons obtenu un tomodensitogramme pour chaque cadavre afin d’évaluer la précision du positionnement de la vis pédiculaire  classée selon 4 catégories : A) vis entièrement dans le pédicule  B) vis < 2 mm hors du pédicule  C) vis de 2–4 mm hors du pédicule  ou D) vis > 4 mm hors du pédicule. Vingt-quatre médecins résidents en chirurgie orthopédique ont participé à l’étude clinique. Au total  65 % d’entre eux ont préféré utiliser la technique à main libre dans un contexte de formation  même si la plupart (60 %) considéraient que la CAO était plus sécuritaire. La principale raison justifiant cette préférence était le degré de difficulté technique associé à la CAO. De plus  une évaluation de la précision du positionnement a montré qu’avec la technique à main libre  5 des vis posées se classaient dans les catégories A ou B (sécuritaire) et 19 dans les catégories C ou D (non sécuritaire)  alors que la CAO a permis de positionner 15 vis dans les catégories A ou B et 9 dans les catégories C ou D (p = 0 008). Chez un sous-groupe de patients souffrant de traumatismes abdominaux pénétrants  le traitement conservateur est sécuritaire et se traduit par une durée de séjour inférieure de 1 9 jour. La présence de fluide détectée par tomodensitographie est un indicateur de l'échec du traitement.
Epidemiology,,,Parkinson's disease and risk of prostate cancer: A Danish population-based case-control study  1995-2010. Prostate cancer growth and progression may be linked to neurogenesis and to medical anti- Parkinson treatment  but results are inconclusive. Therefore  we examined the association between Parkinson's disease and risk of prostate cancer in a population based case-control study. We identified 45 429 patients diagnosed with incident prostate cancer during 1997-2010 from the National Cancer Registry. Five age-matched population controls (n=227 145) were selected for each case. Odds ratios (ORs) adjusted for age and comorbidity for prostate cancer associated with Parkinson's disease were computed using conditional logistic regression. Analyses were stratified by duration of Parkinson's disease and stage of prostate cancer (localized and advanced). In total  245 patients (0 5%) and 1656 controls (0 7%) had Parkinson's disease. Overall  patients with Parkinson's disease had a 27% lower risk of prostate cancer compared with patients without Parkinson's disease (adjusted OR (ORa) 0.73; 95% confidence interval (CI)  0.63-0.83). Risk of prostate cancer decreased with increasing duration of Parkinson's disease. The odds ratios were slightly lower for advanced prostate cancer (ORa  0.68; 95% CI  0.52-0.88) than for localized prostate cancer (ORa 0.76; 95% CI  0.61-0.93). Parkinson's disease was associated with a risk reduction overall (27%)  which decreased with increasing duration of Parkinson's disease.
Epidemiology,,,Low-dose aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and prostate cancer risk: a nationwide study. Increasing evidence suggests that aspirin use may protect against prostate cancer. In a nationwide case-control study  using Danish high-quality registry data  we evaluated the association between the use of low-dose aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the risk of prostate cancer. We identified 35 600 patients (cases) with histologically verified prostate cancer during 2000-2012. Cases were matched to 177 992 population controls on age and residence by risk-set sampling. Aspirin and nonaspirin NSAID exposure was defined by type  estimated dose  duration  and consistency of use. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs)  with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs)  for prostate cancer associated with low-dose aspirin (75-150 mg) or nonaspirin NSAID use  adjusted for potential confounders. Use of low-dose aspirin was associated with an OR for prostate cancer of 0.94 (95 % CI 0.91-0.97). Slightly lower ORs were seen with increasing cumulative amount  duration  and consistency of low-dose aspirin use (continuous use  ≥5 years: OR 0.89; 95 % CI 0.82-0.97; ≥10 years: OR 0.86; 95 % CI 0.70-1.06). Nonaspirin NSAID use was associated with a slightly increased OR for prostate cancer (1.13; 95 % CI 1.10-1.15); however  this association was confined to localized disease and did not vary materially with amount  duration  or consistency of nonaspirin NSAID use. Our study indicates that long-term  consistent low-dose aspirin use may provide modest protection against prostate cancer. The slightly increased risk of only localized prostate cancer with nonaspirin NSAID use suggests a noncausal explanation of the observed association.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Treatment of psychotic depression]. Psychotic depression is frequent among hospitalized patients diagnosed with major depression. Patients diagnosed with this type of depression display a number of specific characteristics. They have a higher risk of suicidal behaviour  they have a prolonged and more severe clinical picture and subsequently they have an increased risk of relapse. Studies show that monotherapy with antidepressants is more effective than antipsychotic monotherapy. Electroconvulsive therapy remains the most effective treatment  while tricyclic antidepressants in monotherapy are also effective. An antipsychotic drug can be added if no effect of monotherapeutic antidepressant treatment is observed within two to four weeks.
Pharmacoepidemiology,,,Risk factors for venous thromboembolism during pregnancy. Pregnant women are at an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Risk factors for VTE among pregnant women are not sufficiently investigated. To examine pharmacological and non-pharmacological VTE risk factors during pregnancy (antepartum). The population comprised all pregnant women in Denmark aged 15-50 giving birth 2003-2010. Pregnancies were linked on an individual level with national registers for hospital admissions and drug dispenses from pharmacies. Risk of first occurring VTE antepartum was examined with Cox regression models. Out of 299 810 pregnancies  337 experienced a VTE  incidence rate 1.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-1.3) per 1000 pregnancies. Being underweight (body mass index [BMI] < 18.5 kg/m(2) ) was associated with a decreased risk of VTE (hazard ratio [HR] 0.53 [CI 0.29-0.98]) compared to normal weight (18.5 ≤ BMI < 25 kg/m(2) ). Overweight (25 ≤ BMI < 30 kg/m(2) ) increased VTE risk (HR 1.30 [CI 1.01-1.67]) but obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2) ) was insignificant (HR 1.14 [CI 0.82-1.58]). A history of VTE was highly significant (HR 72.65 [CI 51.17-103.15]). The youngest (<20 years) and oldest (≥35 years) had insignificantly increased risks (HR 1.45 [CI 0.80-2.62] and HR 1.31 [CI 0.98-1.75]  respectively) compared to those aged 20-30 years. Sixteen groups of medications  including anti-infectious medications  hormones  aminosalicylic acid  insulin  and benzodiazepine derivatives  were associated with VTE. The risk of antepartum VTE was increased in women with prior VTE. Compared to normal weight women  being underweight decreased the risk of VTE whereas being overweight increased the risk. Also  the use of several medications was associated with increased risk of VTE.
Epidemiology,,,Obesity is a risk factor for atrial fibrillation among fertile young women: a nationwide cohort study. Obesity has been associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF)  but whether this risk is also prevalent in younger individuals is unknown. We therefore investigated the risk of AF in relation to body mass index (BMI) among young fertile women. By cross-linkage of nationwide registers of childbirth and hospitalization  we identified 271 203 women without prior AF who gave birth in Denmark between 2004 and 2009. Body mass index (kg/m(2)) was examined as a risk factor for AF using proportional hazard models. Mean age was 30.6 years (4.7 SD) and median follow-up was 4.6 years (interquartile range 2.9-5.8). During the follow-up  110 women were hospitalized with first-time AF; very few individuals had known risk factors for AF. Overall incidence rate of AF was 9.3 [95% confidence interval (CI): 7.7-11.2] per 100 000 person-years. According to BMI  the incidence rate of AF per 100 000 person-years was 7.4 (5.6-9.7) in normal weight (BMI: 18.5-24.9)  8.5 (5.5-13.1) in overweight (BMI: 25-29.9)  15.8 (9.3-26.7) in obese (BMI: 30-35)  and 27.3 (15.5-48.1) in very obese (BMI >35) individuals. Multivariable regression analyses adjusted for age  hyperthyroidism  and previous use of beta-blockers revealed a hazard ratio of 2.04 (95% CI: 1.13-3.69) in the obese and 3.50 (1.86-6.58) in the very obese individuals compared with normal weight. Obesity is a risk factor for AF among young and essentially healthy fertile women despite the low incidence of AF. These results may have implications for prevention of AF.
Rehabilitation,,,Predictors of improvement in observed functional ability in patients with fibromyalgia as an outcome of rehabilitation. To investigate predictors of improvement in observed ability to manage activities of daily living as an outcome of rehabilitation in fibromyalgia. Exploratory analyses used data from the Interdisciplinary Rehabilitation and Evaluation Programme for Patients with Chronic Widespread Pain (the IMPROvE study); a randomized controlled trial including 191 females with fibromyalgia randomized (1:1) to rehabilitation or a waiting list. The primary outcome was observed activities of daily living ability evaluated with the Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS) 6 months post-intervention. Overall  38.7% of subjects were AMPS responders  i.e. having a clinically meaningful improvement in AMPS activities of daily living ability measures at 6 months post-intervention. In the exploratory analysis  only 4 baseline variables out of the 52 analysed showed a statistically significant interaction with treatment allocation (at the 0.05 level) indicating possible predictive value. Statistical analyses that used continuous variables dichotomized at the median suggested a predictive value of a low intake of weak and strong analgesics  and a high score of current pain and total score on the Pain Detect Questionnaire. The results of this exploratory study suggest that several subgroups of patients  specifically those with a low baseline intake of weak and strong analgesics  and more pronounced clinical signs of central sensitization  may gain most clinical benefit from specialized rehabilitation when the outcome of interest is improvement in observed activity of daily living ability.
Rehabilitation,,,Association of Physical Fitness With Fibromyalgia Severity in Women: The al-Ándalus Project. To assess the association between physical fitness and fibromyalgia (FM) severity in women with FM as well as to assess whether different fitness components present an independent relation with FM severity. Population-based cross-sectional study. University facilities and FM associations. Women with FM (N=444). Not applicable. FM severity was assessed with the Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQR). Aerobic fitness (6-min walk test)  muscle strength (handgrip  chair stand  and arm curl tests)  flexibility (chair sit and reach and back scratch tests)  and motor agility (8 foot Up and Go test) were measured with the Senior Fitness Test battery and digital dynamometry. A standardized composite score (hereafter "global fitness profile") was calculated and divided into quintiles. Overall  physical fitness was significantly associated with the FIQR total and subscale scores  regardless of the fitness test used (all P<.05). The 6-minute walk and back-scratch tests were independently associated with the FIQR total score (R(2)=.88; both P<.005). The group with the highest global fitness profile had 16% lower FM severity than did the group with the lowest global fitness profile (P<.001). Our results suggest that higher physical fitness is consistently associated with lower FM severity in women with FM. Aerobic fitness and flexibility present independent associations with FM severity. However  the FIQR variability explained by these fitness tests was rather low (<10%)  and further research on the potential disagreement between performance-based physical fitness and different self-reported outcomes in women with FM is warranted.
Occupational Therapy,,,Describing patients with a duration of sick leave over and under one year in Norway. This study aimed to describe the somatic  social  psychological  and work-related factors that characterize participants with a duration of sick leave over and under one year. During 2012  181 patients on long-term sick leave were consecutively recruited and asked to answer an extensive survey. Several outcomes were reported  addressing work-related factors and somatic  psychological  and social symptoms. In cross-sectional analyses  sick leave duration was dichotomized as > or < one year  based on Norwegian legislation. Linear and logistic regressions were used to estimate population probabilities and means. The estimated prevalence of pain  fatigue  anxiety  and depression was overall high. There was a tendency towards a higher prevalence of fatigue  anxiety  and depression in those with sick leave duration less than one year  with the exception of sleep problems  which was more frequent in the population with longer duration. Relationship with friends  family  co-workers  and the last workplace were worse in the population with longer duration. Cross-sectional analyses indicated that social and work-related problems are more adverse in patients with longer duration of sick leave  while psychological and somatic symptoms appear less adverse. This is one of the first studies quantitatively demonstrating these differences through comprehensive  simultaneously measured self-report questionnaires.
Cardiology,Sports Medicine,,Position paper: proposal for a core curriculum for a European Sports Cardiology qualification. Sports cardiology is a new and rapidly evolving subspecialty. It aims to elucidate the cardiovascular effects of regular exercise and delineate its benefits and risks  so that safe guidance can be provided to all individuals engaging in sports and/or physical activity in order to attain the maximum potential benefit at the lowest possible risk. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) advocates systematic preparticipation cardiovascular screening in an effort to identify competitive athletes at risk of exercise-related cardiovascular events and sudden cardiac death. However  the implementation of preparticipation screening is hindered because of lack of structured training and as a result lack of sufficient expertise in the field of sports cardiology. In 2008 the European Society of Cardiology published a core curriculum for the general cardiologist  in which sports cardiology was incorporated within the topic 'Rehabilitation and Exercise Physiology'. However  the exponential rise in knowledge and the growing demand for expertise in the field of sports cardiology dictates the need to systematically structure the knowledge base of sports cardiology into a detailed curriculum. We envisage that the curriculum would facilitate more uniform training and guideline implementation throughout Europe  and safeguard that evaluation and guidance of competitive athletes or individuals who wish to engage in leisure-time sports activities is performed by physicians with expertise in the field. The current manuscript provides a comprehensive curriculum for sports cardiology  which may serve as a framework upon which universities and national and international health authorities will develop the training  evaluation and accreditation in sports cardiology.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Herbal medicines--evidence and drug interactions in clinical practice]. We present an evidence-based literature review of five commonly used herbs in Denmark: St John's wort  ginkgo biloba  valerian  garlic  and ginseng. Various drug interactions are associated with the intake of some herbal medicines  and may result in many clinical conditions. We bring this to the attention of clinical practitioners. Attention to clinical practice and recommendations for discontinuation of the five herbs are given before surgery. Physicians should be aware of and report potential drug interactions and adverse effects  so as to throw more light on this subject.
General Practice,,,Prevalence of neuropathy and peripheral arterial disease and the impact of treatment in people with screen-detected type 2 diabetes: the ADDITION-Denmark study. There is limited evidence on how intensive multifactorial treatment (IT) improves outcomes of diabetes when initiated in the lead time between detection by screening and diagnosis in routine clinical practice. We examined the effects of early detection and IT of type 2 diabetes in primary care on the prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) 6 years later in a pragmatic  cluster-randomized parallel group trial. A stepwise screening program in 190 general practices in Denmark was used to identify 1 533 people with type 2 diabetes. General practices were randomized to deliver either IT or routine care (RC) as recommended through national guidelines. Participants were followed for 6 years and measures of DPN and PAD were applied. We found no statistically significant effect of IT on the prevalence of DPN and PAD compared with RC. The prevalence of an ankle brachial index ≤0.9 was 9.1% (95% CI 6.0-12.2) in the RC arm and 7.3% (5.0-9.6) in the IT arm. In participants tested for vibration detection threshold and light touch sensation  the prevalence of a least one abnormal test was 34.8% (26.7-43.0) in the RC arm and 30.1% (24.1-36.1) in the IT arm. In a population with screen-detected type 2 diabetes  we did not find that screening followed by IT led to a statistically significant difference in the prevalence of DPN and PAD 6 years after diagnosis. However  treatment levels were high in both groups.
General Practice,,,Semi-structured interview is a reliable and feasible tool for selection of doctors for general practice specialist training. In order to optimise the selection process for admission to specialist training in family medicine  we developed a new design for structured applications and selection interviews. The design contains semi-structured interviews  which combine individualised elements from the applications with standardised behaviour-based questions. This paper describes the design of the tool  and offers reflections concerning its acceptability  reliability and feasibility. We used a combined quantitative and qualitative evaluation method. Ratings obtained by the applicants in two selection rounds were analysed for reliability and generalisability using the GENOVA programme. Applicants and assessors were randomly selected for individual semi-structured in-depth interviews. The qualitative data were analysed in accordance with the grounded theory method. Quantitative analysis yielded a high Cronbach's alpha of 0.97 for the first round and 0.90 for the second round  and a G coefficient of the first round of 0.74 and of the second round of 0.40. Qualitative analysis demonstrated high acceptability and fairness and it improved the assessors' judgment. Applicants reported concerns about loss of personality and some anxiety. The applicants' ability to reflect on their competences was important. The developed selection tool demonstrated an acceptable level of reliability  but only moderate generalisability. The users found that the tool provided a high degree of acceptability; it is a feasible and useful tool for -selection of doctors for specialist training if combined with work-based assessment. Studies on the benefits and drawbacks of this tool compared with other selection models are relevant. not relevant. not relevant.
Aerospace Medicine,,,Postural control and shoulder steadiness in F-16 pilots: a randomized controlled study. During maneuvering  fighter pilots experience loads of up to 50-70 kg on their necks. Neck disorders are common and have been linked to impairment in muscle control. We conducted an intervention study introducing targeted training for 24 wk that reduced neck pain. The current study reports the results of the secondary objective  which was to increase the understanding of possible mechanisms underlying such neck pain and its intervention-related relief. In a parallel  single-blinded  randomized controlled study  55 F-16 pilots were evaluated at baseline and randomized to a control group (CG; N = 28) or training group (TG; N = 27). Postural control was tested in four different settings: Romberg with open and closed eyes  unilateral stance  and perturbation. Maximal voluntary contraction and force steadiness was measured for shoulder elevation. At follow-up  there was a significant between-group difference in the Romberg test with closed eyes only (95% confidence ellipse area; CG: 761 +/- 311 mm2; TG: 650 +/- 405 mm2). Prior to randomization  there were no significant differences in postural control and steadiness between 30 pilots who experienced neck pain within the previous 3 mo and 25 pilots without such pain. Impaired postural control and steadiness may only be quantifiable in individuals experiencing acute neck pain of certain intensity  and there may be a ceiling effect in the ability to improve these parameters. For individuals with highly developed physiological capacity  a battery of tests with more stringent demands should be considered  e.g.  increased number of repetitions  prolonged duration of the tests  or testing with eyes closed.
Aerospace Medicine,,,Centrifuge-induced neck and back pain in F-16 pilots: a report of four cases. Early in their careers  as an important part of their training to become fighter pilots  pilots undergo centrifuge training in order to learn effective anti-G straining maneuvers (AGSM) and to test their G tolerance. The exposure of pilots  especially early in their careers  to training that could lead to injuries should be avoided. This is a report of four cases of neck pain experienced during G-tolerance training  some of which may have caused ongoing problems for the pilot. Four cases  describing four different injuries experienced during G-tolerance training  are presented  including the history of the incident  radiographic description  and physical examination. Three main questions were identified in regards to the training of fighter pilots in centrifuges: 1) should the seat be positioned to imitate a specific aircraft's seat? 2) should the pilot wear a helmet and a mask? 3) what is the appropriate amount of head support? Based on the four cases reported it is recommended that pilots should be given the best possible conditions concerning neck support and load on the neck and the back for G-tolerance testing. Training the pilot in an anatomical neutral sitting position  without a helmet  and with maximal neck support minimizes head movements in cases of conscious or unconscious loss of muscle control. To test the stability of the neck in a setup similar to the environment where the pilot is going to operate  the pilot should be given the opportunity to prepare himself or herself accordingly in advance.
Internal Medicine,,,Inadequate use of prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism in Danish medical departments. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) constitutes a major risk factor in hospitalized acutely ill medical patients. It has been demonstrated in numerous papers that by using different forms of prophylaxis  a significant reduction of the incidence of VTE can be achieved. In this article we assessed the tendencies in the use of venous thromboprophylaxis (TP) at internal medicine departments in Denmark. The results were compared with results from a similar study conducted in 2005. All medical departments in Denmark received a two-page questionnaire on TP. The recipients were asked to evaluate the frequency  use of local instructions  form of administration  side-effects and duration of TP at their departments. One reminder was sent out. A total of 188 responses were received (90% response rate)  16 were excluded. Virtually all departments indicated that they used TP (92%). At intensive care units  the TP was used according to local guidelines at 77% of the wards and at the other subspecialties of internal medicine  TP was used in less than 50%. By far the most frequently used prophylaxis method was low molecular weight heparin  which was used by more than 80% of the departments. Side-effects  most often superficial bleeding and haematomas  were reported in 25% of the cases. The following serious side-effects were reported: heparininduced thrombocytopenia (n = 2)  stroke (n = 1) and gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 3). No difference was observed between the hospitals of larger cities and those of smaller cities. In Denmark  no significant increase in the use of TP at internal medicine departments has been observed since 2005. The guideline's strong recommendation of TP is still not reflected in daily practice. not relevant. not relevant.
Telepathology,,,Virtual microscopy: an evaluation of its validity and diagnostic performance in routine histologic diagnosis of skin tumors. Digitization of histologic slides is associated with many advantages  and its use in routine diagnosis holds great promise. Nevertheless  few articles evaluate virtual microscopy in routine settings. This study is an evaluation of the validity and diagnostic performance of virtual microscopy in routine histologic diagnosis of skin tumors. Our aim is to investigate whether conventional microscopy of skin tumors can be replaced by virtual microscopy. Ninety-six skin tumors and skin-tumor-like changes were consecutively gathered over a 1-week period. Specimens were routinely processed  and digital slides were captured on Mirax Scan (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging  Göttingen  Germany). Four pathologists evaluated the 96 virtual slides and the associated 96 conventional slides twice with intermediate time intervals of at least 3 weeks. Virtual slides that caused difficulties were reevaluated to identify possible reasons for this. The accuracy was 89.2% for virtual microscopy and 92.7% for conventional microscopy. All κ coefficients expressed very good intra- and interobserver agreement. The sensitivities were 85.7% (78.0%-91.0%) and 92.0% (85.5%-95.7%) for virtual and conventional microscopy  respectively. The difference between the sensitivities was 6.3% (0.8%-12.6%). The subsequent reevaluation showed that virtual slides were as useful as conventional slides when rendering a diagnosis. Differences seen are presumed to be due to the pathologists' lack of experience using the virtual microscope. We conclude that it is feasible to make histologic diagnosis on the skin tumor types represented in this study using virtual microscopy after pathologists have completed a period of training. Larger studies should be conducted to verify whether virtual microscopy can replace conventional microscopy in routine practice.
Submarine Medicine,,,Disposition of 2 6-di-tert-butyl-4-nitrophenol (DBNP)  a submarine atmosphere contaminant  in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The phenol 2 6-di-tert-butyl-4-nitrophenol (DBNP) is a contaminant found onboard submarines and is formed by the nitration of an antioxidant present in turbine lubricating oil TEP 2190. DBNP has been found on submarine interior surfaces  on eating utensils and dishes  and on the skin of submariners. DBNP exposure is a potential health concern because it is an uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Adult male rats were dosed once by oral gavage with 15 or 40 mg/kg DBNP mixed with 14C-DBNP in kanola oil and 0.8% v/v DMSO (n = 16/group). The distribution of 14C in major tissues was measured over time for up to 240 h post-dose. Unexpectedly  6/16 (40%) of the rats gavaged with 40 mg/kg DBNP died within 24 h of dosing. Prostration  no auditory startle response  reduced locomotor activity  and muscular rigidity persisted in survivors for up to 8 days after dosing. For animals dosed with 15 mg/kg DBNP  radioactivity levels were significantly elevated in the following tissues 24h after dosing: fat>liver>kidneys>heart>lungs>brain>striated muscle>spleen. Radioactivity levels were elevated for fat  liver  kidney  heart  and lungs of animals euthanized 144 h post-dosing and in the liver of animals euthanized 240 h post-dosing. These findings suggest that DBNP may accumulate in the body as a result of continuous or repeat exposures of short interval to DBNP.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Sparse effect of long-term treatment with macrolides in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]. Macrolides have been proposed to have a positive effect in patients with inflammatory lung diseases  including patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  who suffer from acute exacerbations. Increased use of macrolides for long-term treatment of patients with COPD has been observed. The evidence of a treatment effect of macrolides in this area is sparse  but some studies suggest that it might be beneficial on the number of exacerbations and the length between them. At present there is not sufficient evidence to issue a general recommendation for prescribing macrolides for the long-term treatment of COPD.
Cardiology,,,Sudden unexpected death in children with congenital heart defects. Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are the most common birth defects and are an important cause of death in children. The fear of sudden unexpected death has led to restrictions of physical activity and competitive sports. The aim of the present study was to investigate the rate of sudden unexpected deaths unrelated to surgery in children 2-18 years old with CHDs and  secondarily  to determine whether these deaths were related to cardiac disease  comorbidity  or physical activity. To identify children with CHDs and to determine the number of deaths  data concerning all 9 43 871 live births in Norway in 1994-2009 were retrieved from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway  the Cardiovascular Disease in Norway project  the Oslo University Hospital's Clinical Registry for Congenital Heart Defects and the Norwegian Cause of Death Registry. Survivors were followed through 2012  and information for the deceased children was retrieved from medical records at Norwegian hospitals. Among 11 272 children with CHDs  we identified 19 (0.2%) children 2-18 years old who experienced sudden unexpected deaths unrelated to cardiac surgery. A cardiac cause of death was identified in seven of these cases. None of the children died during physical activity  whereas two children survived cardiac arrest during sports. Sudden unexpected death was infrequent among children with CHDs who survived 2 years of age. Comorbidity was common among the children who died. This study indicates that sudden unexpected death in children with CHDs rarely occurs during physical activity.
Forensic Medicine,,,[Non penetrating cardiac trauma]. Traffic accidents are a very important leading cause of death in young adults in our country and the most cause of non penetrating cardiac trauma. Cardiac contusions represent the most common form of non penetrating cardiac trauma but a wide spectrum of cardiac injury ranging from  cardiac valve is not usually foremost in the minds of physicians dealing with acutely injured patients because initial screening is usually focused on others classic and common injuries. There is actually no controversies surrounding the fact that tnsoesophageal echocardiography is becoming the corner stone and the most useful modality of the evaluation of severe chest trauma with suspicion of cardiac injury. This paper describe the most important blunt cardiac injuries and emphasizes indirectly the need for early diagnosis that becomes an easy one  if the physician keeps in mind such a possibility in all traumatised patients. Another concern is to point out the importance of appropriate therapeutic approach that may significantly improve outcomes in patients with blunt cardiac trauma.
Rheumatology,,,Standards of care for patients with spondyloarthritis. To define and give priory to standards of care in patients with spondyloarthritis (SpA). A systematic literature review on SpA standards of care and a specific search in relevant and related sources was performed. An expert panel was established who developed the standards of care and graded their priority (high  mild  low  or no priority) following qualitative methodology and Delphi process. An electronic survey was sent to a representative sample of 167 rheumatologists all around the country  who also gave priority to the standards of care (same scale). A descriptive analysis is presented. The systematic literature review retrieved no article specifically related to SpA patients. A total of 38 standards of care were obtained-12 related to structure  20 to process  and 6 to result. Access to care  treatment  and safety standards of care were given a high priority by most of rheumatologists. Standards not directly connected to daily practice were not given such priority  as standards which included a time framework. The standards generated for the performance evaluation (including patient and professionals satisfaction) were not considered especially important in general. This set of standards of care should help improve the quality of care in SpA patients.
Naval Medicine,,,Mental readiness for maritime international operation: procedures developed by Norwegian navy. Seafarer's mental health is vital for a well-functioning organisation. Neglecting mental health status on board could be extremely costly for both the crew affected as well as the company. The present article outlines an extensive programme implemented in the Royal Norwegian Navy for personnel deployed in international operations. The challenges involved in international operations bare similarities to onboard personnel in civilian maritime operations. The program utilised by the Royal Norwegian Navy is extensive and not immediately applicable to civilian maritime companies. However  elements of this program could be used with limited resources. Questionnaire based screening  before  during and at the end of a contract period could result in early detections of mental health problems and increased retaining of personnel. This should be done by health professionals. Early targeting of at risk personnel could prevent serious costs for the individual as well as the company.
Naval Medicine,,,Legionella pneumophila in Norwegian naval vessels. Little is known about the occurrence of Legionella pneumophila in water supply systems on board ships. Our aim was to study the occurrence of L. pneumophila in the water supply system on board Norwegian naval vessels as the basis for framing preventive strategies against Legionella infection. Water samples were collected from technical installations and from the water distribution network on board 41 vessels and from ten water filling (bunkering) stations  the sampling taking place in two rounds separated by a one-year interval. The samples were subjected to analysis  including serotyping and genotyping  with a view to identifying the presence of L. pneumophila and of free-living amoebae. L. pneumophila was found in 20 out of a total of 41 vessels in the first round of sampling  and live L. pneumophila serogroup 1 was isolated in seven of the 20 vessels. Free-living amoebae were found in the water supply system in most of the vessels  including all the vessels with L. pneumophila. The same genotype of L. pneumophila was identified in the water in bunkering stations and in the water on board the vessels. L. pneumophila was not present in all the vessels  but all the vessels where the bacterium was found were also contaminated with free-living amoebae. We have demonstrated the probability of the fresh water from bunkering stations being the source of the contamination. In framing preventive strategies  importance should therefore be attached to identifying the source of contamination and the presence of free-living amoebae  as a premise for the establishment and growth of L. pneumophila in onboard water supply systems.
Forensic Toxicology,,,The PMMA epidemic in Norway: comparison of fatal and non-fatal intoxications. During a 6 month period (July 2010-January 2011) we observed 12 fatal intoxications and 22 non-fatal cases related to the drug paramethoxymethamphetamine (PMMA) in Norway (4.8 mill inhabitants). This toxic designer drug  also known as "Death"  is occasionally found in street drugs offered as "ecstasy" or "amphetamine". The present study aimed to evaluate the cause of death  and to compare the PMMA blood concentrations in fatal and non-fatal cases. Methods for identification and quantification of PMMA are presented. The median age of fatalities was 30 years (range 15-50) with 67% males; in non-fatal cases 27 years (20-47) with 86% males. In the 12 fatalities  the median PMMA blood concentration was 1.92 mg/L (range 0.17-3.30)  which is in the reported lethal range of 0.6-3.1 mg/L in peripheral blood and 1.2-15.8 mg/L in heart blood. In the 22 non-fatal cases  the median PMMA concentration was 0.07 mg/L (range 0.01-0.65). Poly-drug use was frequent both in fatal and non-fatal cases. The PMA concentrations ranging from 0.00 to 0.26 mg/L in both groups likely represented a PMMA metabolite. Three fatalities were attributed to PMMA only  six to PMMA and other psychostimulant drugs  and three to PMMA and CNS depressant drugs  with median PMMA concentrations of 3.05 mg/L (range 1.58-3.30)  2.56 (1.52-3.23) and 0.52 mg/L (0.17-1.24)  respectively. Eight victims were found dead  while death was witnessed in four cases  with symptoms of acute respiratory distress  hyperthermia  cardiac arrest  convulsions  sudden collapse and/or multiple organ failure. In summary  all fatalities attributed to PMMA had high PMMA blood concentrations compared to non-fatal cases. Our sample size was too small to evaluate a possible impact of poly-drug use. A public warning is warranted against use and overdose with illegal "ecstasy" or "speed" drugs.
Pathology  Clinical,,,Structured electronic health records. In order to succeed in realising general health-policy goals for cancer care  they must be formulated as specific and realistic objectives. An administrative organ must be provided with the authority and funding needed to establish the technical solutions required. Reporting to national registries must take place automatically in electronic form  on the basis of ongoing structured reporting in the patient records. In our opinion the Directorate of Health should enter into cooperation with the College of American Pathologists  with a view to integrating a Norwegian version of their electronic checklists for pathology reporting of cancer into the hospitals' record systems.
Telemedicine,,,Bridging the distance: a prospective tele-oncology study in Northern Norway. The University Hospital of North Norway (UNN) is a tertiary-level hospital and has the main responsibility of providing specialized cancer health care in the remote area of Northern Norway. Weekly videoconferences (VCs) have been established to enable clinicians at a local hospital and primary cancer health care providers in five different communities to discuss cases with specialist cancer care services at UNN. In this study  we aimed to evaluate the feasibility of these VCs. This is a prospective registration study. Descriptive data were collected at UNN  and for each patient discussed at the VC  a survey was completed by the local health care provider responsible for the patient. During an 18-month period  167 cases were discussed (101 patients). A median of 7 health care providers participated in each VC. According to the local physicians and nurses  the VCs contributed in 96% of cases to give "quite a bit" or "very much" confidence in adequate patient care. They reported that patient care in 85% of cases would be improved "quite a bit" or "very much" due to the VC. The mean number of days waiting for VC were 2.0 days (range  0-7; SD  2.0) and was significantly shorter (P < 0.001) than the estimated time waiting if alternative consultations were to be used (mean  10.2 days (range  0-30; SD  5.8)). VC may be a useful supplemental tool to support primary health care providers at local hospitals and remote communities in their effort to offer efficient and high-quality cancer care.
Family Practice,,,Observed communication skills: how do they relate to the consultation content? A nation-wide study of graduate medical students seeing a standardized patient for a first-time consultation in a general practice setting. In this study  we wanted to investigate the relationship between background variables  communication skills  and the bio-psychosocial content of a medical consultation in a general practice setting with a standardized patient. Final-year medical school students (N = 111) carried out a consultation with an actor playing the role of a patient with a specific somatic complaint  psychosocial stressors  and concerns about cancer. Based on videotapes  communication skills and consultation content were scored separately. The mean level of overall communication skills had a significant impact upon the counts of psychosocial issues  the patient's concerns about cancer  and the information and planning parts of the consultation content being addressed. Gender and age had no influence upon the relationship between communication skills and consultation content. Communication skills seem to be important for final-year students' competence in addressing sensitive psychosocial issues and patients' concerns as well as informing and planning with patients being representative for a fairly complex case in general practice. This result should be considered in the design and incorporation of communication skills training as part of the curriculum of medical schools.
Evidence-Based Medicine,Rheumatology,,Evidence-based recommendations for treatment with methotrexate in rheumatic disorders. The aim of this study was to develop 3E (Evidence  Expertise  Exchange) recommendations (RCs) on the use of methotrexate in rheumatic disorders and to assess the agreement among Danish rheumatologists. Based on a systematic literature review and Delphi votes  national and multinational (MN) RCs were developed by 751 rheumatologists from 17 countries including Denmark  and the degree of agreement among the participants was assessed. Subsequently  a survey regarding the agreement on the MN RCs was sent to all Danish rheumatologists. A total of 24 Danish RCs were elaborated by 43 rheumatologists at a national meeting. 71-100% (median 94%) of the participants agreed with each of the RCs. A total of 73 rheumatologists answered the survey on the ten MN RCs. On numerical rating scales with values ranging from zero to ten  the median agreement score for each of these RCs ranged from eight to ten. The RCs were already applied in daily practice by 70-100% (median 91%) of the specialists. Any direct conflict between the national and MN RCs was not evident. Based on evidence and expert opinion in a MN approach  national and MN RCs on methotrexate therapy were developed and a high level of agreement among Danish rheumatologists was evidenced.
Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine,,,Postural balance in low back pain patients: criterion-related validity of centre of pressure assessed on a portable force platform. Altered postural control has been observed in low back pain (LBP) patients. They seem to be more dependent on vision when standing. The objective of the study was to determine concurrent and predictive validity of measures of postural stability in LBP patients. Centre of Pressure (CoP) measurements were tested against pain  fear of pain  and physical function. Velocity  anterior-posterior displacement  and the Romberg Ratio obtained on a portable force platform were used as measures of postural stability. Baseline and 12-week follow-up results of 97 LBP patients were evaluated. The correlations between CoP measurements and pain  fear of pain  and physical function were poor. There were no significant differences in CoP measurements between patients with no change or deterioration and patients with improvement in pain and back-specific function. This first study of concurrent and predictive validity of postural balance in LBP patients revealed no association between CoP measures and pain  fear of pain  and physical function.
Molecular Epidemiology,,,Genetic characterization of emerging coxsackievirus A12 associated with hand  foot and mouth disease in Qingdao  China. To characterize the genetic properties of coxsackievirus A12 (CVA12) strains isolated from hand  foot and mouth disease (HFMD) patients in Qingdao during 2008-2011  the complete genome and VP1 coding region were sequenced and analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all strains from China clustered into three different branches  suggesting multiple lineages of CVA12 co-circulating in Asia. Sequence analysis indicated a monophyletic group only when the P1 region was examined  indicating possible recombination between CVA12 and other HEV-A serotypes. The emergence of CVA12 involved in an HFMD outbreak in China is a public-health issue.
Global Health,,,Re-evaluation of the WHO (2010) formaldehyde indoor air quality guideline for cancer risk assessment. In 2010  the World Health Organization (WHO) established an indoor air quality guideline for short- and long-term exposures to formaldehyde (FA) of 0.1 mg/m(3) (0.08 ppm) for all 30-min periods at lifelong exposure. This guideline was supported by studies from 2010 to 2013. Since 2013  new key studies have been published and key cancer cohorts have been updated  which we have evaluated and compared with the WHO guideline. FA is genotoxic  causing DNA adduct formation  and has a clastogenic effect; exposure-response relationships were nonlinear. Relevant genetic polymorphisms were not identified. Normal indoor air FA concentrations do not pass beyond the respiratory epithelium  and therefore FA's direct effects are limited to portal-of-entry effects. However  systemic effects have been observed in rats and mice  which may be due to secondary effects as airway inflammation and (sensory) irritation of eyes and the upper airways  which inter alia decreases respiratory ventilation. Both secondary effects are prevented at the guideline level. Nasopharyngeal cancer and leukaemia were observed inconsistently among studies; new updates of the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) cohort confirmed that the relative risk was not increased with mean FA exposures below 1 ppm and peak exposures below 4 ppm. Hodgkin's lymphoma  not observed in the other studies reviewed and not considered FA dependent  was increased in the NCI cohort at a mean concentration ≥0.6 mg/m(3) and at peak exposures ≥2.5 mg/m(3); both levels are above the WHO guideline. Overall  the credibility of the WHO guideline has not been challenged by new studies.
Rheumatology,,,Update on the OMERACT magnetic resonance imaging task force: research and future directions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides an important biomarker across a range of rheumatological diseases. At the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) 11 meeting  the MRI task force continued its work of developing and improving the use of MRI outcomes for use in clinical trials. The breadth of pathology in the Rheumatoid Arthritis MRI Score has been strengthened with further work on the development of a joint space narrowing score  and a series of exercises presented at OMERACT 11 demonstrated good reliability and construct validity for this assessment. Understanding the importance of residual inflammation after RA treatment remains a major focus of the group's work. Analyses were presented on defining the level of synovitis (using MRI scores of a single hand) that would predict absence of erosion progression. The development of the OMERACT Hand Osteoarthritis MRI score has continued with substantial work presented on its iterative development  including pathology definition  scaling  and subsequent reliability of the score. Optimizing the role of MRI as a robust biomarker and surrogate outcome remains a priority for this group.
Geriatric Nursing,,,[A nine-year controlled follow-up study of delirium patients discharged after treatment in a psychogeriatric university department]. Although delirium is a reversible cerebral syndrome  the effect of treatment of the elderly is unsatisfactory  involving prolonged hospitalizations and increased risk of relapse and mortality. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether hospitalization for delirium (severe delirium) diagnosed by ICD-10 criteria predicts increased morbidity  utilization of health services and mortality. Delirious inpatients (n = 26) discharged after treatment in an old-age psychiatric university clinic were studied for nine years. In a register-based design  the above-mentioned parameters of the delirium cohort were compared with a group of controls (n = 116). There was a trend to increased mortality in the delirium cohort. Compared with the controls  the delirium cohort had a significantly increased incidence of disorders of vital organs  serious psychiatric disorders  particularly depression  increased use of hospital psychiatry and general practitioner's out-of-hours service  but less use of office-hour services. The incidence of delirium in the cohorts was low. In the delirium cohort  there was no significantly increased use of services or the number of diagnoses in somatic hospitals. Increased somatic and psychiatric morbidity and a trend to increased mortality indicate a serious prognosis after severe delirium in the elderly. It is noteworthy that the delirium cohort had increased use of GPs' out-of-hours services but less use of office-hour services.
Medical Oncology,Ophthalmology,,The Pediatric Choroidal and Ciliary Body Melanoma Study: A Survey by the European Ophthalmic Oncology Group. To collect comprehensive data on choroidal and ciliary body melanoma (CCBM) in children and to validate hypotheses regarding pediatric CCBM: children younger than 18 years  males  and those without ciliary body involvement (CBI) have more favorable survival prognosis than young adults 18 to 24 years of age  females  and those with CBI. Retrospective  multicenter observational study. Two hundred ninety-nine patients from 24 ocular oncology centers  of whom 114 were children (median age  15.1 years; range  2.7-17.9 years) and 185 were young adults. Data were entered through a secure website and were reviewed centrally. Survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression. Proportion of females  tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage  cell type  and melanoma-related mortality. Cumulative frequency of having CCBM diagnosed increased steadily by 0.8% per year of age between 5 and 10 years of age and  after a 6-year transition period  by 8.8% per year from age 17 years onward. Of children and young adults  57% and 63% were female  respectively  which exceeded the expected 51% among young adults. Cell type  known for 35% of tumors  and TNM stage (I in 22% and 21%  II in 49% and 52%  III in 30% and 28%  respectively) were comparable for children and young adults. Melanoma-related survival was 97% and 90% at 5 years and 92% and 80% at 10 years for children compared with young adults  respectively (P = 0.013). Males tended to have a more favorable survival than females among children (100% vs. 85% at 10 years; P = 0.058). Increasing TNM stage was associated with poorer survival (stages I  II  and III: 100% vs. 86% vs. 76%  respectively; P = 0.0011). By multivariate analysis  being a young adult (adjusted hazard rate [HR]  2.57)  a higher TNM stage (HR  2.88 and 8.38 for stages II and III  respectively)  and female gender (HR  2.38) independently predicted less favorable survival. Ciliary body involvement and cell type were not associated with survival. This study confirms that children with CCBM have a more favorable survival than young adults 18 to 25 years of age  adjusting for TNM stage and gender. The association between gender and survival varies between age groups.
Ophthalmology,,,Update on simulation-based surgical training and assessment in ophthalmology: a systematic review. This study reviews the evidence behind simulation-based surgical training of ophthalmologists to determine (1) the validity of the reported models and (2) the ability to transfer skills to the operating room. Simulation-based training is established widely within ophthalmology  although it often lacks a scientific basis for implementation. We conducted a systematic review of trials involving simulation-based training or assessment of ophthalmic surgical skills among health professionals. The search included 5 databases (PubMed  EMBASE  PsycINFO  Cochrane Library  and Web of Science) and was completed on March 1  2014. Overall  the included trials were divided into animal  cadaver  inanimate  and virtual-reality models. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. Validity evidence was evaluated using a modern validity framework (Messick's). We screened 1368 reports for eligibility and included 118 trials. The most common surgery simulated was cataract surgery. Most validity trials investigated only 1 or 2 of 5 sources of validity (87%). Only 2 trials (48 participants) investigated transfer of skills to the operating room; 4 trials (65 participants) evaluated the effect of simulation-based training on patient-related outcomes. Because of heterogeneity of the studies  it was not possible to conduct a quantitative analysis. The methodologic rigor of trials investigating simulation-based surgical training in ophthalmology is inadequate. To ensure effective implementation of training models  evidence-based knowledge of validity and efficacy is needed. We provide a useful tool for implementation and evaluation of research in simulation-based training.
Ophthalmology,,,Simulation-based certification for cataract surgery. To evaluate the EyeSi(™) simulator in regard to assessing competence in cataract surgery. The primary objective was to explore all simulator metrics to establish a proficiency-based test with solid evidence. The secondary objective was to evaluate whether the skill assessment was specific to cataract surgery. We included 26 ophthalmic trainees (no cataract surgery experience)  11 experienced cataract surgeons (>4000 cataract procedures) and five vitreoretinal surgeons. All subjects completed 13 different modules twice. Simulator metrics were used for the assessments. Total module score on seven of 13 modules showed significant discriminative ability between the novices and experienced cataract surgeons. The intermodule reliability coefficient was 0.76 (p < 0.001). A pass/fail level was defined from the total score on these seven modules using the contrasting-groups method. The test had an overall ability to discriminate between novices and experienced cataract surgeons  as 21 of 26 novices (81%) versus one of 11 experienced surgeons (9%) did not pass the test. The vitreoretinal surgeons scored significantly higher than the novices (p = 0.006)  but not significantly lower than the experienced cataract surgeons (p = 0.32). We have established a performance test  consisting of seven modules on the EyeSi(™) simulator  which possess evidence of validity. The test is a useful and reliable tool for assessment of both cataract surgical and general microsurgical skills in vitro.
Specialization,,,Doctors applying for Danish postgraduate medical specialist training are getting younger. It was previously shown that applicants for postgraduate medical specialist training in Denmark were old. In order to prevent potential shortage of specialists  the Danish health authorities have passed legislation to speed up the output of new specialists. The aim of this study was to highlight the present characteristics of young doctors who entered specialist training. Data include 443 doctors who were enrolled in a formalized postgraduate medical training programme in the Region of Southern Denmark from 2009 to 2011. 41% of the recruited young doctors were men and 59% were women. The average age for doctors recruited for residency training was 35 years and the average time from graduation to initiation of specialist training (candidate age) was 70 months. If foreign graduates were excluded  the average age was 34 years and average candidate age was 58 months. 6% of the recruited doctors had a PhD. 61% of the doctors were graduates from the University of Southern Denmark. 14% graduated from the University of Copenhagen and 12% from Aarhus University. Finally  13% graduated from a foreign university. Applicants accepted for specialist training are becoming younger at a faster rate than the new legislation can explain. The gender distribution seems to have been stable for more than a decade. The number of doctors who had a PhD seemed low; however  there was a variation between specialties.
General Practice,,,The role of general practice in postgraduate basic training. In recent years  there has been growing interest in the role of primary care in postgraduate training. Relatively little has been published about benefits of early and sustained postgraduate basic training in general practice  especially for doctors with other ambitions than family medicine. To explore young Danish doctors' views on basic medical training including views on the participation of general practice. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of all Danish doctors  who took part in the postgraduate basic training programmes in 2009. The survey consisted of rating scale and qualitative questions. We used a phenomenological approach. Almost all of the young Danish doctors responding felt that training in general practice is a necessary part of a postgraduate basic training programme. Early training in primary care not only gives doctors a broad understanding of the health care system but also strengthens the ability to collaborate with general practitioners upon entering another specialty. It also develops important medical and communicative competences. The training in general practice is considered beneficial for the development of professional identity. The educational environment in general practice is rated highly. The inclusion of family medicine in postgraduate basic training should be considered for all doctors.
Epidemiology,,,Shock in the emergency department; a 12 year population based cohort study. The knowledge of the frequency and associated mortality of shock in the emergency department (ED) is limited. The aim of this study was to describe the incidence  all-cause mortality and factors associated with death among patients suffering shock in the ED. Population-based cohort study at an University Hospital ED in Denmark from January 1  2000  to December 31  2011. All patients aged ≥18 years living in the hospital catchment area with a first time ED presentation with shock (n = 1646) defined as hypotension (systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≤100 mmHg)) and ≥1 organ failures. Outcomes were annual incidence per 100 000 person-years at risk (pyar)  all-cause mortality at 0-7  and 8-90 days and risk factors associated with death. We identified 1646 of 438 191 (0.4 %) ED patients with shock at arrival. Incidence of shock increased from 53.8 to 80.6 cases per 100 000 pyar. The 7-day  and 90-day mortality was 23.1 % (95 % CI: 21.1-25.1) and 40.7 % (95 % CI: 38.3-43.1)  respectively. Independent predictors of 7-day mortality were: age (adjusted HR 1.03 (95 % CI: 1.03-1.04)  and number of organ failures (≥3 organ failures; adjusted HR 3.13 95 % CI: 2.28-4.30). Age  comorbidity level and number of organ failure were associated with 90-day mortality. Shock is a frequent and critical finding in the ED  carrying a 7- and  90- day mortality of 23.1 and 40.7 %  respectively. Age and number of organ failures are independent prognostic factors for death within 7 days  whereas age  comorbidity and organ failures are of significance within 8-90 days.
Epidemiology,,,The daily risk of bacteremia during hospitalization and associated 30-day mortality evaluated in relation to the traditional classification of bacteremia. We investigated the overall and daily incidence of bacteremia among hospitalized patients and evaluated the traditional classification of bacteremia (community-onset vs nosocomial based on a 48-hour time window) by means of the daily incidence and associated 30-day mortality. In a multicenter hospital-based cohort study  we included all patients aged 15 years or older admitted to hospitals in Funen County  Denmark  during 2000-2008  and identified all first bacteremias per admission. We calculated the overall incidence of bacteremia per 1 000 admissions and 10 000 bed-days  as well as the daily incidence of bacteremia per 10 000 bed-days and associated 30-day mortality. We included 724 339 admissions and 10 281 bacteremias for an overall incidence of 14.2 per 1 000 admissions and 23.6 per 10 000 bed-days. The daily incidence was highest on the first 2 days of admission followed by lower incidences that were constant beyond day 12  but varied according to patient and epidemiologic characteristics. Thirty-day mortality for patients with bacteremia was 18% on day 1  21% on day 2  and between 25% and 35% thereafter. Hospitalized patients were at the highest risk of bacteremia during the first 2 days followed by lower incidences that were constant beyond day 12. Thirty-day mortality was 18%-21% for patients with bacteremia on the first 2 days and 25%-35% thereafter. Our findings support the traditional classification of bacteremia.
Family Practice,,,[Memory problems among elderly patients in general practice: the importance of caregiver information]. The aim was to describe and analyse signs that make caregivers suspect memory problems among elderly patients in general practice. This prospective study was conducted in October and November 2002 among all patients aged 65 or older who consulted a GP in a total of 17 practices in Copenhagen inner city. The patients who agreed to participate were asked to complete a questionnaire regarding memory  quality of life  etc. Their GP completed a questionnaire independently  and a MMSE was subsequently given to the patient. Where consent was obtained from a patient  a postal questionnaire regarding the patient's memory was mailed to a caregiver chosen by the patient. Out of 775 patients 62% (483) gave consent to contact a caregiver. Among the caregivers who received the questionnaire a total of 74% returned the questionnaire. A total of 88 (26%) of the caregivers suspected that the patient had memory problems. Predictors for caregiver suspicion of memory problems were: patient had complained about memory problems to caregiver (OR 21.7)  caregiver had received information for other sources that the patient suffered from memory problems (OR 5.0)  a MMSE in the interval between 0-24 (OR 4.5) and a low quality of life (OR 3.1). Furthermore  if the patient was male  caregivers were more likely to report memory problems. Memory impairment is commonly observed by caregivers  but is rarely discussed with a GP. The results indicate that more focus on the possibility of memory impairment among elderly patients is important in general practice.
Epidemiology,,,Inverse comorbidity in multiple sclerosis: Findings in a complete nationwide cohort. Inverse comorbidity is disease occurring at lower rates than expected among persons with a given index disease. The objective was to identify inverse comorbidity in MS. We performed a combined case-control and cohort study in a total nationwide cohort of cases with clinical onset of MS 1980-2005. We randomly matched each MS-case with five population controls. Comorbidity data were obtained from multiple  independent nationwide registries. Cases and controls were followed from January 1977 to the index date  and from the index date through December 2012. We controlled for false discovery rate and investigated each of eight pre-specified comorbidity categories: psychiatric  cerebrovascular  cardiovascular  lung  and autoimmune comorbidities  diabetes  cancer  and Parkinson's disease. A total of 8947 MS-cases and 44 735 controls were eligible for inclusion. We found no inverse associations with MS before the index date. After the index date  we found a decreased occurrence of chronic lung disease (asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) (HR 0.80 (95% CI 0.75-0.86  p<0.00025)) and overall cancer (HR 0.88 (95% CI 0.81-0.95  p=0.0005)) among MS-cases. This study showed a decreased risk of cancers and pulmonary diseases after onset of MS. Identification of inverse comorbidity and of its underlying mechanisms may provide important new entry points into the understanding of MS.
Epidemiology,,,Vascular comorbidities in multiple sclerosis: a nationwide study from Denmark. To investigate the occurrence of vascular comorbidities before and after the clinical onset of multiple sclerosis. In this combined case-control and cohort study  all Danish born citizens with onset of multiple sclerosis 1980-2005 were identified from the Danish Multiple Sclerosis Registry and randomly matched with controls regarding year of birth  gender  and municipality on January 1st in the year of multiple sclerosis (MS) onset (index date). Individual-level information on comorbidities was obtained from several independent nationwide registries and linked to the study population by unique personal identification numbers. To assess the presence of vascular comorbidities before and after MS onset  cases and controls were followed from January 1977 to the index date  and from the index date through December 2012. We used logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and Cox regression to calculate hazard ratios (HRs). Before the index date  MS cases had a decreased probability for cerebrovascular comorbidity [OR 0.69 (95 % CI 0.48-0.99  p = 0.043)]  and a numerically but not statistically significant decreased probability for cardiovascular comorbidity [OR 0.87 (95 % CI 0.71-1.07  p = 0.188)]. After the index date  MS cases had an increased risk for cerebrovascular comorbidity [HR 1.84 (95 % CI 1.69-2.00  p < 0.0005)]  and for cardiovascular comorbidity [HR 1.08 (95 % CI 1.02-1.15  p = 0.013)]. The lower occurrence of cerebrovascular comorbidities in cases prior to MS onset could be due to protective immune mechanisms  while the higher occurrence of vascular comorbidities in cases after MS onset could be because of converging causal pathways of the coexisting diseases. These findings deserve to be studied closer in a broader spectrum of comorbidities in MS.
Global Health,,,Relationship between sunlight and the age of onset of bipolar disorder: an international multisite study. The onset of bipolar disorder is influenced by the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. We previously found that a large increase in sunlight in springtime was associated with a lower age of onset. This study extends this analysis with more collection sites at diverse locations  and includes family history and polarity of first episode. Data from 4037 patients with bipolar I disorder were collected at 36 collection sites in 23 countries at latitudes spanning 3.2 north (N) to 63.4 N and 38.2 south (S) of the equator. The age of onset of the first episode  onset location  family history of mood disorders  and polarity of first episode were obtained retrospectively  from patient records and/or direct interview. Solar insolation data were obtained for the onset locations. There was a large  significant inverse relationship between maximum monthly increase in solar insolation and age of onset  controlling for the country median age and the birth cohort. The effect was reduced by half if there was no family history. The maximum monthly increase in solar insolation occurred in springtime. The effect was one-third smaller for initial episodes of mania than depression. The largest maximum monthly increase in solar insolation occurred in northern latitudes such as Oslo  Norway  and warm and dry areas such as Los Angeles  California. Recall bias for onset and family history data. A large springtime increase in sunlight may have an important influence on the onset of bipolar disorder  especially in those with a family history of mood disorders.
Orthodontics,,,Northcroft lecture: how has the spectrum of orthodontics changed over the past decades? Three aspects have had a significant impact on orthodontics during the last few decades: the appliances being used  the anchorage being used and finally the distribution of patients being treated. Firstly  the marketing of appliances is increasingly leading the orthodontist to outsource important aspects of treatment such as wirebending and bracket positioning. Brackets and wires are being presented as the solution to all problems and metaphysical terms such as 'intelligent design ' 'working brackets' and 'intelligent wires' are dominating advertising and reducing the impact of evidence-based treatment approaches. Secondly  the introduction of skeletal anchorage has potentially widened the spectrum of orthodontics  allowing for treatments that could not be done with conventional appliances. Biomechanical knowledge is  however  mandatory if we agree that the system should not be abused. Thirdly  the orthodontic population comprises an increasing number of adult patients  many of whom are characterized by a degenerated dentition. The treatment of these patients requires a thorough knowledge not only of biomechanics but also of the reaction of the periodontal tissues to various types of loading. They can be treated only with custom-made appliances adapting the force systems and magnitude to the patient-specific treatment goal. In summary  the orthodontic world is being split between 'appliance-driven fast-food orthodontics' where the results to a large extent are dependent on both growth and function and 'orthodontist-driven' 'slow-food' treatments attempting to push the limits of the possible in relation to complicated problems and reversal of degeneration in adult patients. The latter treatments are performed with individualized appliances adapting the force system to the patient. This paper will attempt to summarize the bearing of these factors on present orthodontics.
Clinical Medicine,,,Important options available--from start to finish--for translating proteomics results to clinical chemistry. In the realm of clinical chemistry  the field of clinical proteomics  that is  the application of proteomic methods for understanding mechanisms and enabling diagnosis  prediction  measurement of activity  and treatment response in disease  is first and foremost a discovery and research tool that feeds assay development downstream. Putative new assay candidates generated by proteomics discovery projects compete with well-established assays with known indications  well-described performance  and of known value in specific clinical settings. Careful attention to the many options available in the design  execution  and interpretation of clinical proteomics studies is thus necessary for translation into clinical practice. We here review and discuss important options associated with clinical proteomics endeavors stretching from the planning phases to the final use in clinical chemistry.
Epidemiology,,,Hospitalisation  surgical and medical recurrence rates in inflammatory bowel disease 2003-2011—a Danish population-based cohort study. The aim of this study is to evaluate the cumulative probability of recurrence and admission rates in an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) inception cohort diagnosed in 2003-2004. Data on medications  phenotypes and surgery for 513 individuals with ulcerative colitis (UC  n=300) and Crohn's disease (CD  n=213) were obtained from medical records and linked to population-based health administrative database information. The admission rates and cumulative probability of recurrences were estimated  and the association with the baseline factors and medication was tested. The cumulative risk of first recurrence after 1  5 and 7 years was 40%  63%  and 66% in CD patients and 51%  75%  and 79% in UC patients  respectively. The cumulative risk of first surgical relapse was 6%  18%  and 23% at 1  5 and 7 years in CD respectively. One hundred and CD patients (66%) and 142 UC patients (47%) had at least one IBD-related hospitalisation. The hospitalisation rate decreased from 7.0 days/person-year in year one to 0.9 day at year 5 in CD  and from 4.7 days to 0.4 days for UC patients. Age above 40  current smoking  stricturing behaviour  and disease localisation (colonic  ileocolonic  and upper-GI) at diagnosis were predictors of recurrence in CD. In UC  age above 40 and former smoker status were predictors of recurrence and left-sided and extensive colitis were predictors of first-time hospitalisation. In an era of improved treatment options  the recurrence rates  but not the surgery or hospitalisation rates  have decreased for CD but not for UC. The phenotypic characteristics at diagnosis predict the risk of recurrence and hospitalisation.
Precision Medicine,Telemedicine,,eHealth: individualization of mesalazine treatment through a self-managed web-based solution in mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. To individualize treatment with mesalazine for ulcerative colitis relapses through a self-managed  web-based solution to optimize the short-term disease course. Prospective  open-label  web-guided study with 3 months mesalazine therapy among patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. Once a week  patients completed the simple clinical colitis activity index (SCCAI) and registered fecal calprotectin (FC) on the web application: www.meza.constant-care.dk. SCCAI and FC were summed and resulted in a total inflammatory burden score (TIBS). Deep remission was defined as SCCAI ≤1; FC = 0  and TIBS ≤1. A total of 95 patients (62% females; median age 45 yr) were included in the study and allocated 4.8 g mesalazine per day. Of these  82 (86%) patients were adherent to web therapy  completing 3 months of web-guided mesalazine therapy. Of the 82 adherent patients  72 (88%) continued mesalazine and 10 (12%) needed rescue therapy. From weeks 0 to 12  patients had experienced a significant reduction in mean SCCAI (4.6 versus 1.6  P < 0.001)  mean FC (437 versus 195  P < 0.001)  and mean TIBS (6.7 versus 2.4  P < 0.001). Based on TIBS values (≤1)  the dose of mesalazine was reduced to 2.4 g in 25% of patients at week 3 in 50% of subjects at week 5 and in 88% of patients at week 12. Web-guided therapy with mesalazine in mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis helps to individualize the dose and improve adherence to therapy. The study confirms mesalazine efficacy in mild-to-moderate UC  significantly improving TIBS values in majority of the patients.
Rehabilitation,,,The psychosocial needs of gynaecological cancer survivors: A framework for the development of a complex intervention. To develop and pilot test an intervention targeting the women's psychosocial needs during the follow-up period after surgical treatment for gynaecological cancer. The project consisted of four phases. Phase 1 involved development of an intervention on the basis of meetings with key healthcare professionals  a literature review and six semi-structured interviews with women who attended the existing follow-up program. The Guided Self-Determination (GSD) method developed in diabetes care was identified as an appropriate framework for the intervention. GSD consists of reflection sheets for patients and advanced professional communication skills. The GSD method was adapted to women in a follow-up program after gynaecologic cancer treatment (GSD-GYN-C). Phase 2 involved primary pilot testing of the intervention and the findings were used to modify the intervention in phase 3. This modification involved the development of additional reflection sheets and a fidelity assessment tool. A systematic training program was arranged for the GSD-GYN-C-nurses. Phase 4 involved secondary pilot testing where nurses and women confirmed the applicability of GSD-GYN-C and final adjustments were made. Selected measurements were tested for sensitivity during pilot testing. Data from phase 2 and 4 were also used to select the primary outcome and calculate power for a future randomized clinical trial (RCT). Pilot testing supported our hypothesis that GSD-GYN-C may be transferable and useful to survivors of gynaecological cancer. GSD-GYN-C was developed and validated and is now ready for evaluation in an RCT.
Orthopedics,,,ISAKOS upper extremity committee consensus statement on the need for diversification of the Rockwood classification for acromioclavicular joint injuries. Optimal treatment for the unstable acromioclavicular (AC) joint remains a highly debated topic in the field of orthopaedic medicine. In particular  no consensus exists regarding treatment of grade III injuries  which are classified according to the Rockwood classification by disruption of both the coracoclavicular and AC ligaments. The ISAKOS Upper Extremity Committee has provided a more specific classification of shoulder pathologies to enhance the knowledge on and clinical approach to these injuries. We suggest the addition of grade IIIA and grade IIIB injuries to a modified Rockwood classification. Grade IIIA injuries would be defined by a stable AC joint without overriding of the clavicle on the cross-body adduction view and without significant scapular dysfunction. The unstable grade IIIB injury would be further defined by therapy-resistant scapular dysfunction and an overriding clavicle on the cross-body adduction view.
Pathology  Molecular,,,Hyperplastic polyps of the colon and rectum - reclassification  BRAF and KRAS status in index polyps and subsequent colorectal carcinoma. Hyperplastic polyps (HP) of the colon and rectum were previously considered benign. Newer studies have suggested that colorectal HP are different entities. The aim of this study was to reclassify lesions from a 5-year period previously classified as colorectal HP into traditional hyperplastic polyp (THP)  sessile serrated lesions (SSL)  and other lesions. All patients were confirmed in the Danish National Pathology Database for the occurrence of metachronous polyps/adenomas  colorectal cancer (CRC)  and other gastrointestinal malignancies. Molecular pathology of the CRC were characterized and correlated with the index lesion. In total  591 HP biopsy specimens were obtained from 480 patients. The lesions were reclassified as: 358 THP  109 SSL  35 TA  81 unspecified non-neoplastic lesions  four traditional serrated adenoma  and 4 SSL with cytological dysplasia. Seven patients developed CRC in the follow-up period (1 patient had SSL  4 had THP  and 2 had unspecified non-neoplastic lesions). Ten patients developed other gastrointestinal malignancies. The patient with SSL as index lesions who developed CRC harbored V600E BRAF mutation in both index lesion and the carcinoma. Sixteen percent of patients with SSL subsequently developed a neoplastic lesion. Further studies are needed to clarify the cancer risk of SSL.
Epidemiology,,,Increasing incidence of acute Achilles tendon rupture and a noticeable decline in surgical treatment from 1994 to 2013. A nationwide registry study of 33 160 patients. The purpose of this study is to investigate the incidence of acute Achilles tendon rupture in Denmark from 1994 to 2013 with focus on sex  age  geographical areas  seasonal variation and choice of treatment. The National Patient Registry was retrospectively searched to find the number of acute Achilles tendon rupture in Denmark during the time period of 1994-2013. Regional population data were retrieved from the services of Statistics Denmark. During the 20-year period  33 160 ruptures occurred revealing a statistically significant increase in the incidence (p < 0.001  range = 26.95-31.17/100 000/year). Male-to-female ratio was 3:1 and average age 45 years for men and 44 years for women. There was a statistically significant increasing incidence for people over 50 years. A higher incidence in rural compared with urban geographical areas was found  but this was not statistically significant. There was a statistically significant decreasing incidence of patients treated with surgery from 16.9/10(5) in 1994 to 6.3/10(5) in 2013. The incidence of acute Achilles tendon rupture increased from 1994 to 2013 based on increasing incidence in the older population. There was no difference in incidence of acute Achilles tendon rupture in the rural compared with urban geographical areas. A steady decline in surgical treatment was found over the whole period  with a noticeable decline from 2009 to 2013  possibly reflecting a rapid change in clinical practice following a range of high-quality randomized clinical trials (RCT).

Telemedicine,,,Diagnostic performance and system delay using telemedicine for prehospital diagnosis in triaging and treatment of STEMI. European ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) guidelines recommend prehospital diagnosis to facilitate early reperfusion in patients with STEMI  and they provide recommendations regarding optimal system delay (time from first medical contact (FMC) to the primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI)). There are limited data on achievable system delays in an optimal STEMI system of care using prehospital diagnosis to triage patients with STEMI directly to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) centres. We examined the proportion of tentative prehospital STEMI diagnoses established by telemedicine confirmed on hospital arrival  and we determined system delay in patients diagnosed before hospital arrival and triaged directly to the catheterisation laboratory.  Population-based follow-up study. Central Denmark Region. 15 992 patients diagnosed using telemedicine. During the study period  a tentative diagnosis of STEMI was established in 1061 patients  of whom 919 were triaged directly to the PCI centre. In 771 (84%) patients  a diagnosis of STEMI was confirmed. Patients transported <10 km had a mean system delay of 82 min; this delay rose to 103 min for patients transported 50-75 km. Data on system delay was achievable in 682 patients in whom 553 (81%) were treated within 120 min of the FMC  and a system delay of <120 min was achievable in 89% of patients living up to 95 km from the PCI centre. Even for patients living <10 km from the PCI centre  only 16 (14%) had a system delay of 60 min or less. The use of telemedicine for prehospital diagnosis and triage of patients directly to the catheter laboratory is feasible and allows 89% of patients living up to 95 km from the invasive centre to be treated with PPCI within 120 min of the emergency medical service call. The study confirms that a recommendation of a system delay <60 min is unachievable if the FMC is the emergency medical call.
Chiropractic,,,Retropharyngeal tendinitis may be more common than we think: a report on 45 cases seen in Danish chiropractic clinics. This study presents information from 45 cases of retropharyngeal tendinitis that were collected in Danish chiropractic clinics. A practicing Danish chiropractor collected cases of retropharyngeal tendinitis from colleagues who were members of the Danish Society of Chiropractic and Clinical Biomechanics. Only cases where a patient history of acute severe neck pain  cervical stiffness  and dysphagia were considered  and these were supplemented with imaging in the form of x-rays  computed tomography  or magnetic resonance imaging scans. All cases were reviewed independently by the chiropractor and a medical radiologist with a specialty in musculoskeletal disorders before acceptance into this case series. Forty-five cases fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Sixteen of these were recruited from a single chiropractic practice. Nineteen were males and 26 were females with an average age of 48 years. All but 2 patients had the characteristic depositions of calcium hydroxyapatite in the tendon of the longus colli muscle  and the average diameter of the retropharyngeal space was 8.1 mm. Patients presenting with a triad of acute severe neck pan  stiff neck  and dysphagia may have retropharyngeal tendinitis. This condition may be a more common than previously thought among patients presenting with acute neck pain in the primary health care sector.
Global Health,,,Effects of nitrogen dioxide on human health: systematic review of experimental and epidemiological studies conducted between 2002 and 2006. In order to assess health effects in humans caused by environmental nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) a systematic review of studies in humans was conducted. MEDLINE database was searched for epidemiological studies and experiments on adverse effects of NO(2) published between 2002 and 2006. The evidence with regard to NO(2) exposure limits was assessed using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) grading system and the modified three star system. Of the 214 articles retrieved 112 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. There was limited evidence that short-term exposure to a 1-h mean value below 200 microg NO(2)/m(3) is associated with adverse health effects provided by only one study on mortality in patients with severe asthma (*2+). The effect remained after adjusting for other air pollutants. There was moderate evidence that short-term exposure below a 24-h mean value of 50 microg NO(2)/m(3) at monitor stations increases hospital admissions and mortality (**2+). Evidence was also moderate when the search was restricted to susceptible populations (children  adolescents  elderly  and asthmatics). There was moderate evidence that long-term exposure to an annual mean below 40 microg NO(2)/m(3) was associated with adverse health effects (respiratory symptoms/diseases  hospital admissions  mortality  and otitis media) provided by generally consistent findings in five well-conducted cohort and case-control studies with some shortcomings in the study quality (**2+). Evidence was also moderate when the search was restricted to studies in susceptible populations (children and adolescents) and for the combination with other air pollutants. The most frequent reasons for decreased study quality were potential misclassification of exposure and selection bias. None of the high-quality observational studies evaluated was informative for the key questions due to the choice of the dose parameter (e.g.  1-week mean) and exposure levels above the limit values. Inclusion of study designs unlisted in the SIGN grading system did not bring additional evidence regarding exposures below the current air quality limit values for NO(2). As several recent studies reported adverse health effects below the current exposure limits for NO(2) particularly among susceptible populations regarding long-term exposure further research is needed. Apart from high-quality epidemiological studies on causality and the interaction of NO(2) with other air pollutants there is a need for double-blinded randomized cross-over studies among susceptible populations for further evaluation of the short-term exposure limits.
Ophthalmology,,,Non-physician delivered intravitreal injection service is feasible and safe - a systematic review. Non-physicians such as nurses are trained to give injections into the vitreous body of the eye to meet the increasing demand for intravitreal therapy with vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors against common eye diseases  e.g. age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. We systematically reviewed the existing literature to provide an overview of the experiences in this transformational process. We searched for literature on 22 September 2015 using PubMed  Embase  the Cochrane Library  CINAHL and the Web of Science. Eligible studies had to address any outcome based on non-physician delivered intravitreal therapy regardless of the study design. Being non-physician was defined as the injecting personnel not being a physician  but no further restrictions were made. Five studies were included with a total of 31 303 injections having been performed by 16 nurses. The studies found that having nurses perform the intravitreal injections produced to a short-term capacity improvement and liberated physicians for other clinical work. Training was provided through courses and direct supervision. The rates of endophthalmitis were 0-0.40‰  which is comparable to reported rates when the intravitreal therapy is given by physicians. Non-physician delivered intravitreal therapy seems feasible and safe.
Health Occupations,,,Adaptation and reliability of the Readiness for Inter professional Learning Scale in a Danish student and health professional setting. Shared learning activities aim to enhance the collaborative skills of health students and professionals in relation to both colleagues and patients. The Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale is used to assess such skills. The aim of this study was to validate a Danish four-subscale version of the RIPLS in a sample of 370 health-care students and 200 health professionals. The questionnaire was translated following a two-step process  including forward and backward translations  and a pilot test. A test of internal consistency and a test-retest of reliability were performed using a web-based questionnaire. The questionnaire was completed by 370 health care students and 200 health professionals (test) whereas the retest was completed by 203 health professionals. A full data set of first-time responses was generated from the 570 students and professionals at baseline (test). Good internal association was found between items in Positive Professional Identity (Q13-Q16)  with factor loadings between 0.61 and 0.72. The confirmatory factor analyses revealed 11 items with factor loadings above 0.50  18 below 0.50  and no items below 0.20. Weighted kappa values were between 0.20 and 0.40  16 items with values between 0.40 and 0.60  and six items between 0.60 and 0.80; all showing p-values below 0.001. Strong internal consistency was found for both populations. The Danish RIPLS proved a stable and reliable instrument for the Teamwork and Collaboration  Negative Professional Identity  and Positive Professional Identity subscales  while the Roles and Responsibility subscale showed some limitations. The reason behind these limitations is unclear.
Telemedicine,,,Pedometer use and self-determined motivation for walking in a cardiac telerehabilitation program: a qualitative study. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation reduces morbidity and mortality. Walking is a convenient activity suitable for people with cardiac disease. Pedometers count steps  measure walking activity and motivate people to increase physical activity. In this study  patients participating in cardiac telerehabilitation were provided with a pedometer to support motivation for physical activity with the purpose of exploring pedometer use and self-determined motivation for walking experienced by patients and health professionals during a cardiac telerehabilitation program. A qualitative research design consisting of observations  individual interviews and patient documents made the basis for a content analysis. Data was analysed deductively using Self Determination Theory as a frame for analysis and discussion  focusing on the psychological needs of autonomy  competence and relatedness. Twelve cardiac patients  11 health professionals  6 physiotherapists and 5 registered nurses were included. The pedometer offered independence from standardised rehabilitation since the pedometer supported tailoring  individualised walking activity based on the patient's choice. This led to an increased autonomy. The patients felt consciously aware of health benefits of walking  and the pedometer provided feedback on walking activity leading to an increased competence to achieve goals for steps. Finally  the pedometer supported relatedness with others. The health professionals' surveillance of patients' steps  made the patients feel observed  yet supported  furthermore  their next of kin appeared to be supportive as walking partners. Cardiac patients' motivation for walking was evident due to pedometer use. Even though not all aspects of motivation were autonomous and self determined  the patients felt motivated for walking. The visible steps and continuous monitoring of own walking activity made it possible for each individual patient to choose their desired kind of activity and perform ongoing adjustments of walking activity. The immediate feedback on step activity and the expectations of health benefits resulted in motivation for walking. Finally  pedometer supported walking made surveillance possible  giving the patients a feeling of being looked after and supported. Current study is a part of The Teledi@log project.
Nursing,,,Emotion work within eldercare and depressive symptoms: A cross-sectional multi-level study assessing the association between externally observed emotion work and self-reported depressive symptoms among Danish eldercare workers. Danish professional caregivers have high rates of depressive symptoms. One proposed cause is exposure to emotion work. However  emotion work is usually measured by self-report which may bias results. The objective of this study was to examine the association of emotion work  externally observed at the workplace  with self-reported depressive symptoms of professional caregivers. The study was a cross-sectional observational study. Data was collected by 9 observers who assessed emotion work stressors and emotion work resources in 124 individual professional caregivers working in 56 work units across 10 eldercare homes. Emotion work stressors were defined as i) barriers for empathetic care  ii) taxing aggressive events  and iii) taxing non-aggressive events. Emotion work resources were defined as i) meaningful events  and ii) social interactions between professional caregivers and residents. Depressive symptoms were measured by a questionnaire sent to all professional caregivers at the 10 eldercare homes. We constructed two samples for analysis: a) a sample of 95 directly observed professional caregivers with full information on covariates  and b) a sample of 205 observed and non-observed professional caregivers with full information on covariates working in one of the 56 observed work units. Using multilevel regression models we analysed associations of individual and work unit averaged levels of emotion work with depressive symptoms among professional caregivers. None of the three emotion work stressors were associated with depressive symptoms. Of the two emotion work resources  a high amount of social interactions between professional caregivers and residents were  contrary to expectations  related to higher levels of depressive symptoms at both the individual level and the work unit averaged level. The unexpected association between social interactions and depressive symptoms need to be replicated in future studies. These future studies should also investigate whether the association of social interactions and level of depressive symptoms depends on the content of the interactions between professional caregivers and residents.
General Practice,,,A new questionnaire to identify bodily distress in primary care: The 'BDS checklist'. Functional symptoms and disorders are common in primary care. Bodily distress syndrome (BDS) is a newly proposed clinical diagnosis for functional disorders. The BDS diagnosis is based on empirical research  and the symptoms stated in the BDS criteria have been translated into a self-report questionnaire called the BDS checklist. The aim of the present study was to investigate the psychometric properties of the checklist and to test the construct of BDS. The 30-item BDS checklist was completed by 2480 adult primary care patients in a cross-sectional study on contact and disease patterns in Danish general practice. We performed (internal) validation analyses of the collected checklist data. We also performed factor and latent class analyses to identify both BDS symptom groups and BDS patient groups. Internal validation analyses revealed acceptable and usable psychometric properties of the BDS checklist. The factor analyses identified the four distinct determining factors for BDS: cardiopulmonary  gastrointestinal  musculoskeletal and general symptoms. Results from factor and multi-trait analyses suggested a shortening of the BDS checklist (from 30 to 25 items). The latent class analyses resulted in three severity levels (no  moderate and severe BDS); the best fit index was found for a threshold of ≥4 symptoms in a symptom group. The results provide empirical support for the previously described construct of BDS with four symptom groups and three patient groups. The BDS checklist is a self-report instrument that may be used for case finding in both clinical practice and in research.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Supportive psychodynamic psychotherapy versus treatment as usual for first-episode psychosis: two-year outcome. During recent decades  the field of treatment of schizophrenia has lacked empirical  systematic outcome studies that support psychodynamic psychotherapy as an evidence-based intervention for patients with schizophrenia. The Danish schizophrenia project (DNS) compared psychodynamic psychotherapy for psychosis with standard treatment in patients with a first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorder. The study was designed as a prospective  comparative  longitudinal multi-site investigation of consecutively referred patients who were included during two years. The patients were treated with either manualized individual supportive psychodynamic psychotherapy (SPP) in addition to treatment as usual or with treatment as usual alone (TaU). Symptoms and functional outcomes were measured using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Global Assessment of Functioning scale (GAF). The study included 269 consecutively admitted patients  age 18-35  of whom 79% remained in the study after two years. The intervention group improved significantly on measures of both PANSS and GAF scores  with large effect sizes at two years follow-up after inclusion. Further  improvement on GAF(function) (p = 0.000) and GAF(symptom) (p = 0.010) significantly favored SPP in combination with TaU over TaU alone. In spite of limitations  this study speaks in favor of including supportive psychodynamic psychotherapy in the treatment for patients with schizophrenic first-episode psychoses.
Medicine,,,Socioeconomic inequalities in adherence to inhaled maintenance medications and clinical prognosis of COPD. Low socioeconomic status has been associated with adverse outcomes in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  but population-based data are sparse. We examined the impact of education  employment  income  ethnicity  and cohabitation on the risk of suboptimal adherence to inhaled medication  exacerbations  acute admissions  and mortality among COPD patients. Using nationwide healthcare registry data we identified 13 369 incident hospital clinic outpatients with COPD during 2008-2012. We estimated medication adherence as proportion of days covered (PDC) one year from first contact. With Poisson regression we computed adjusted relative risks (aRR) of poor adherence and non-use. With Cox regression we calculated adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) of clinical outcomes. 32% were poor adherers (PDC<0.8) and 5% non-users (PDC = 0). Analyses showed a higher risk of poor adherence among unemployed (aRR1.36  95% CI 1.20-1.54)  low income patients (aRR = 1.07  95% CI 1.00-1.16)  immigrants (aRR = 1.29  95% CI 1.17-1.44)  and patients living alone (aRR = 1.17  95% CI 1.11-1.24). Similarly  non-use was associated with unemployment (aRR = 2.75  95% CI 2.09-3.62)  low income (aRR = 1.37  95% CI 1.10-1.70)  immigrant status (aRR = 1.56  95% CI 1.17-2.08)  and living alone (aRR = 1.53  95% CI 1.30-1.81). Low education was associated with exacerbations (aHR = 1.21  95% CI 1.10-1.35) and admissions (aHR = 1.22  95% CI 1.07-1.38). Low income was associated with admissions (aHR = 1.20  95% CI 1.09-1.32)  and death (aHR = 1.11  95% CI 0.99-1.25). The unemployed and those living alone had lower exacerbation-risk but higher mortality-risk. In Denmark  health equity is a stated priority in a public health care system. Nevertheless  there are substantial socioeconomic inequalities in COPD treatment and outcomes.
Pediatrics,,,The applicability of the WHO classification in paediatric AML. A NOPHO-AML study. The World Health Organization (WHO) classification of myeloid leukaemia was revised in 2008. It incorporates newly recognized entities and emphasizes the pivotal role of cytogenetic abnormalities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usability of the WHO classification when applied to a large population-based paediatric acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cohort. We included children diagnosed with de novo AML  0-18 years of age from the Nordic countries and Hong Kong from 1993 to 2012. Data were retrieved from the Nordic Society for Paediatric Haematology and Oncology AML database and patients classified according to the WHO 2008 classification. A successful karyotype was available in 97% of the cases. AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities were present in 262 (41%) and 94 (15%) were classified as AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MDS). WHO classifies patients with monosomy 7 and del(7q) into one group. We found that -7 (n = 14) had significantly poorer outcome than del(7q) (n = 11); 5-year event-free survival 26% vs. 67%  (P = 0·02)  and 5-year overall survival 51% vs. 90%  (P = 0·04). The largest group was the highly heterogeneous AML not otherwise specified (NOS) (n = 280) (44%). In conclusion  the WHO classification allocated 15% to AML-MDS  44% to NOS and grouped together entities with clearly different outcome  therefore limiting the applicability of the current WHO classification in children with AML.
Nephrology,,,Modifiable risk factors for increased arterial stiffness in outpatient nephrology. Arterial stiffness  as measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV)  is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events and mortality. Arterial stiffness increases with age. However  modifiable risk factors such as smoking  BP and salt intake also impact on PWV. The finding of modifiable risk factors may lead to the identification of treatable factors  and  thus  is of interest to practicing nephrologist. We have now studied the prevalence and correlates of arterial stiffness  assessed by PWV  in 191 patients from nephrology outpatient clinics in order to identify modifiable risk factors for arterial stiffness that may in the future guide therapeutic decision-making. PWV was above normal levels for age in 85/191 (44.5%) patients. Multivariate analysis showed that advanced age  systolic BP  diabetes mellitus  serum uric acid and calcium polystyrene sulfonate therapy or calcium-containing medication were independent predictors of PWV. A new parameter  Delta above upper limit of normal PWV (Delta PWV) was defined to decrease the weight of age on PWV values. Delta PWV was calculated as (measured PWV) - (upper limit of the age-adjusted PWV values for the general population). Mean±SD Delta PWV was 0.76±1.60 m/sec. In multivariate analysis  systolic blood pressure  active smoking and calcium polystyrene sulfonate therapy remained independent predictors of higher delta PWV  while age  urinary potassium and beta blocker therapy were independent predictors of lower delta PWV. In conclusion  arterial stiffness was frequent in nephrology outpatients. Systolic blood pressure  smoking  serum uric acid  calcium-containing medications  potassium metabolism and non-use of beta blockers are modifiable factors associated with increased arterial stiffness in Nephrology outpatients.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[No firm evidence for screening for Chlamydia in connection with spontaneous abortion]. Infection with genital Chlamydia while undergoing a vaginal instrumentation increases the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease with pain and sterility as sequelae. A literature study was performed in order to find out if screening and treatment for Chlamydia trachomatis should be offered to all women with miscarriages. This article reviews the available literature on the topic. The results show that there is a need for larger clinical trials before an evidence-based answer can be given.
Precision Medicine,,,Personalized oncology: genomic screening in phase 1. Improvements in cancer genomics and tumor biology have reinforced the evidence of cancer development driven by numerous genomic alterations. Advanced genomics technology can be used to characterize genomic alterations that potentially drive tumor growth. With the possibility of screening thousands of genes simultaneously  personalized molecular medicine has become an option. New treatments are being investigated in phase 1 trials around the world. Traditionally  the goal of phase 1 studies was to determine the optimal dose and assess dose-limiting toxicity of a potential new experimental drug. Only a limited number of patients will benefit from the treatment. However  introducing genomic mapping to select patients for early clinical trials with targeted molecular therapy according to the genomic findings  may lead to a better outcome for the patient  an enrichment of phase 1 trials  and thereby accelerated drug development. The overall advantage is to determine which mutation profiles correlate with sensitivity or lack of resistance to specific targeted therapies. The utility and current limitations of genomic screening to guide selection to Phase 1 clinical trial will be discussed.
Rehabilitation,,,Enhanced function and quality of life following 5 months of exercise therapy for patients with irreparable rotator cuff tears - an intervention study. Rotator cuff rupture is associated with dysfunction  pain and muscular weakness related to the upper extremity. Some evidence exists to support the beneficial effect of exercises but there is lack of evidence of which exercises imply the best effect and how physiotherapy should be administered. Therefore  the purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a neuromuscular exercise program for patients with irreparable rotator cuff rupture. Based on sample-size calculations thirty patients with chronic irreparable rotator cuff tears (of at least m. supraspinatus and m. infraspinatus) was consecutively included. Twenty-four patients completed the five months training to restore function with focus on centering the humeral head in the glenoid cavity trough strengthening m. deltoideus anterior and m. teres minor. The primary outcome measure was Oxford Shoulder Score which was completed at baseline  3 and 5 months follow-up. One-way  repeated-measure ANOVA was used if data was normally distributed. Secondary outcome measures included EQ-5D  range of motion  strength and muscle activity. Paired t-test and Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test was used to the appropriate outcomes. Improvements was seen for both primary and secondary outcomes from baseline to follow-up. Oxford Shoulder Score improved from 25.6 (SD 8.1) at baseline to 33.8 (SD 8.7) at 3 months (p = 0.004) and 37.2 (SD 8.2) at five months (p < 0.001). Range of motion in abduction significantly increased by 34.4° (95 % CI: 11.6-57.2). Strength measured in flexion 45  flexion 90 and abduction also significantly increased at 5 months by 10.2 (95 % CI: 0.8-19.6)  7.0 (95 % CI: 0.0-14.0) and 12.3 (95 % CI: 3.4-21.3) respectively. The remaining outcomes for range of motion and strengths only showed small and non-significant changes. Furthermore patients reported higher levels of quality of life and reduced level of pain after five months. Following a five months exercise protocol patients with irreparable rotator cuff tears showed increased function in their symptomatic shoulder  reduced pain and increased quality of life. This study therefore supports the use of exercise therapy in patients with irreparable rotator cuff rupture. This study is approved by The National Committee on Health Research Ethics (N-20120040) and registered retrospectively at ClinicalTrials.gov in April 2016 ( NCT02740946 ).
Pathology  Surgical,,,Network Consumption and Storage Needs when Working in a Full-Time Routine Digital Environment in a Large Nonacademic Training Hospital. Digital pathology is indisputably connected with high demands on data traffic and storage. As a consequence  control of the logistic process and insight into the management of both traffic and storage is essential. We monitored data traffic from scanners to server and server to workstation and registered storage needs for diagnostic images and additional projects. The results showed that data traffic inside the hospital network (1 Gbps) never exceeded 80 Mbps for scanner-to-server activity  and activity from the server to the workstation took at most 5 Mbps. Data storage per image increased from 300 MB to an average of 600 MB as a result of camera and software updates  and  due to the increased scanning speed  the scanning time was reduced with almost 8 h/day. Introduction of a storage policy of only 12 months for diagnostic images and rescanning if needed resulted in a manageable storage window of 45 TB for the period of 1 year. Using simple registration tools allowed the transition of digital pathology into a concise package that allows planning and control. Incorporating retrieval of such information from scanning and storage devices will reduce the fear of losing control by the management when introducing digital pathology in daily routine.
Pathology  Clinical,,,Expertise in clinical pathology: combining the visual and cognitive perspective. Expertise studies in the medical domain often focus on either visual or cognitive aspects of expertise. As a result  characteristics of expert behaviour are often described as either cognitive or visual abilities. This study focuses on both aspects of expertise and analyses them along three overarching constructs: (1) encapsulations  (2) efficiency  and (3) hypothesis testing. This study was carried out among clinical pathologists performing an authentic task: diagnosing microscopic slides. Participants were 13 clinical pathologists (experts)  12 residents in pathology (intermediates)  and 13 medical students (novices). They all diagnosed seven cases in a virtual microscope and gave post hoc explanations for their diagnoses. The collected data included eye movements  microscope navigation  and verbal protocols. Results showed that experts used lower magnifications and verbalized their findings as diagnoses. Also  their diagnostic paths were more efficient  including fewer microscope movements and shorter reasoning chains. Experts entered relevant areas later in their diagnostic process  and visited fewer of them. Intermediates used relatively high magnifications and based their diagnoses on specific abnormalities. Also  they took longer to reach their diagnosis and checked more relevant areas. Novices searched in detail  described findings by their appearances  and uttered long reasoning chains. These results indicate that overarching constructs can justly be identified: encapsulations and efficiency are apparent in both visual and cognitive aspects of expertise.
Pathology  Clinical,,,Expertise under the microscope: processing histopathological slides. Although the obvious goal of training in clinical pathology is to bring forth capable diagnosticians  developmental stages and their characteristics are unknown. This study therefore aims to find expertise-related differences in the processing of histopathological slides using a combination of eye tracking data and verbal data. Participants in this study were 13 clinical pathologists (experts)  12 pathology residents (intermediates) and 13 medical students (novices). They diagnosed 10 microscopic images of colon tissue for 2 seconds. Eye movements  the given diagnoses  and the vocabulary used in post hoc verbal explanations were registered. Eye movements were analysed according to changes over trial time and the processing of diagnostically relevant areas. The content analysis of verbal data was based on a categorisation system developed from the literature. Although experts and intermediates showed equal levels of diagnostic accuracy  their visual and cognitive processing differed. Whereas experts relied on their first findings and checked the image further for other abnormalities  intermediates tended to double-check their first findings. In their explanations  experts focused on the typicality of the tissue  whereas intermediates mainly mentioned many specific pathologies. Novices looked less often at the relevant areas and were incomplete  incorrect and inconclusive in their explanations. Their diagnostic accuracy was correspondingly poor. This study indicates that in the case of intermediates and experts  different visual and cognitive strategies can result in equal levels of diagnostic accuracy. Lessons for training underline the relevance of the distinction between normal and abnormal tissue for novices  especially when the mental rotation of 2-D images is required. Intermediates need to be trained to see deviations in abnormalities. Feedback and an educational design that is specific to these developmental stages might improve training.
Pathology  Clinical,,,The evaluation of colon biopsies using virtual microscopy is reliable. Virtual microscopy offers major advantages for pathology practice  separating slide evaluation from slide production. The aim of this study was to investigate the reliability of using whole slide images as compared with routine glass slides for diagnostic purposes. Colon biopsies (n = 295) were assessed using both glass slides and whole slide images by four pathologists and two residents. Two pathologists scored the digital images of biopsies in a primary diagnostic setting. For each case  the consensus diagnosis was defined as the majority diagnosis on the study's glass slides. All diagnoses were grouped into seven main diagnostic categories  and further divided into subgroups. The overall concordance rates were 89.6% for whole slide images and 91.6% for light microscopy. The concordance rates of the subgroups 'adenoma' and 'adenocarcinoma' between whole slide images and conventional microscopy showed only small variability. The intraobserver (whole slide images versus glass slide) agreement  including subgroups  was substantial  with a mean κ-value of 0.78  and was higher than the interobserver agreement for glass slides (interobserver κ-value of 0.69). This study shows good diagnostic accuracy and reproducibility for virtual microscopy  indicating that this technology can reliably be used for pathological evaluation of colon biopsies in a primary clinical setting.
Pathology,,,Whole slide images as a platform for initial diagnostics in histopathology in a medium-sized routine laboratory. Whole slide imaging is the process of digitizing glass slides and the creation of Whole Slide Images (WSI)  which enable the examination of pathology samples on a computer screen in a manner comparable to light microscopy. WSI have been used for different applications in pathology but their use for primary diagnostics is still limited. Implementing WSI for primary diagnostics would be a turning point necessitating extensive validation to unravel pitfalls and difficulties that could be encountered within the routine workflow. This article is aimed to describe the gradual integration of WSI into routine pathology diagnostics in a medium-sized routine pathology laboratory. This project was started with optimizing the digital work environment including the setting up of validation studies  scanning preferences  storing WSI and the implemented adjustments to the workflow for the laboratory and the pathologist. Afterwards scanning glass slides was initiated in the department of pathology at the Atrium Medical Center  Heerlen  The Netherlands  for performing primary diagnostics of breast biopsies. Later this was extended to other specimen types including resections. The validation studies yielded a high concordance rate between WSI and conventional diagnoses. Routine primary WSI based diagnosis was possible in 82.1% of cases. Failure of digital diagnosis was mainly related to poor image quality and logistic problems. The quality of the currently produced WSI is sufficient for primary diagnostics in 82.1% of the cases. Improving image quality  adequate retrieval and controlling scanning error will definitely encourage the wide adaptation in routine diagnostics.
Pathology  Surgical,,,A travel report of the implementation of virtual whole slide images in routine surgical pathology. Virtual microscopy is the terminology used to indicate the use of digitized images of whole slides for inspection of cells and tissue sections on computer screens as an add-on or replacement for conventional microscopy using bright field or other types of illumination in combination with a wide variety of microscope brands. Although technically there is no longer a limit in the size and colour composition of the images  the logistics of embedding virtual microscopy in daily routine of a diagnostic process are still a relatively open area where new pitfalls and opportunities can be found. In this article  we described various aspects in the process. None of them had been planned in advance  but mostly originated from observations done during the different steps towards implementation of virtual microscopy in daily routine  for example  the choice between the different scanner types and their (dis)advantages  issues on storing and retrieval and at last  the effect of digitalization on the diagnostic process. This approach resulted in a manuscript that in a way has more the appearance of a story than of a scientific study with strict protocols  with a clear cut question in advance  a research plan and expected outcome. Depending on the purpose of the virtual slides in a given situation  different solutions must be found locally.
General Practice,,,A geographical cluster randomised stepped wedge study of continuing medical education and cancer diagnosis in general practice. Denmark has inferior cancer survival rates compared with many European countries. The main reason for this is suggested to be late diagnosis at advanced cancer stages. Cancer diagnostic work-up begins in general practice in 85% of all cancer cases. Thus  general practitioners (GPs) play a key role in the diagnostic process. The latest Danish Cancer Plan included continuing medical education (CME) on early cancer diagnosis in general practice to improve early diagnosis. This dual aims of this protocol are  first  to describe the conceptualisation  operationalisation and implementation of the CME and  second  to describe the study design and outcomes chosen to evaluate the effects of the CME. The intervention is a CME in early cancer diagnosis targeting individual GPs. It was developed by a step-wise approach. Barriers for early cancer diagnosis at GP level were identified systematically and analysed using the behaviour system involving capability  opportunity and motivation described by Michie et al. The study will be designed as a geographical cluster randomised stepped wedge study. The study population counts 836 GPs from 417 general practices in the Central Denmark Region  geographically divided into eight clusters. GPs from each cluster will be invited to a CME meeting at a certain date three weeks apart. The primary outcomes will be primary care interval and GP referral rate on cancer suspicion. Data will be obtained from national registries  GP-completed forms on patients referred to cancer fast-track pathways and GP-completed online questionnaires before and after the intervention. To our knowledge  this will be the first study to measure the effect of a theory-based CME in early cancer diagnosis at three levels: GP knowledge and attitude  GP activity and patient outcomes. The achieved knowledge will contribute to the understanding of whether and how general practice's ability to perform cancer diagnosis may be improved. Registered as NCT02069470 on ClinicalTrials.gov.
Telemedicine,,,Patients' use of self-monitored readings for managing everyday life with COPD: a qualitative study. Effects of self-monitoring depend on how patients engage with readings and how this engagement is used for managing chronic disease. This article reports on a study of how chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients made use of readings during 16 weeks of self-monitoring. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 22 COPD patients three times each: at the beginning  halfway through  and after the monitoring device was collected. Spouses of nine interviewees were present during one or more interviews. The analysis of how patients used self-monitored readings was based on critical psychology. Patients used readings to monitor bodily condition  to judge whether and when to contact health professionals  to communicate with health professionals about health management  to revise planned activities  to engage close relatives  and to motivate exercise and other health behavior. Self-monitoring can produce a sense of security as readings provide grounds for explaining symptoms and widen the scope of possibilities for taking action. Patients experienced readings as encouraging  reassuring  depressing  worrisome  and at times disturbing. A few patients involved themselves with readings in ways that are emotionally challenging and contrary to medical advice. Reasons for not making use of self-monitoring include good health or not regarding monitoring as relevant at the time. Results can qualify the support health professionals offer in relation to patients' self-monitoring and self-management.
Telemedicine,,,Using preventive home monitoring to reduce hospital admission rates and reduce costs: a case study of telehealth among chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. We studied whether preventive home monitoring of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) could reduce the frequency of hospital admissions and lower the cost of hospitalization. Patients were recruited from a health centre  general practitioner (GP) or the pulmonary hospital ward. They were randomized to usual care or tele-rehabilitation with a telehealth monitoring device installed in their home for four months. A total of 111 patients were suitable for inclusion and consented to be randomized: 60 patients were allocated to intervention and three were lost to follow-up. In the control group 51 patients were allocated to usual care and three patients were lost to follow-up. In the tele-rehabilitation group  the mean hospital admission rate was 0.49 per patient per 10 months compared to the control group rate of 1.17; this difference was significant (P = 0.041). The mean cost of admissions was €3461 per patient in the intervention group and €4576 in the control group; this difference was not significant. The Kaplan-Meier estimates for time to hospital admission were longer for the intervention group than the controls  but the difference was not significant. Future work requires large-scale studies of prolonged home monitoring with more extended follow-up.
Telemedicine,,,Empowering patients with COPD using Tele-homecare technology. This paper discusses how a tele-rehabilitation program using home tele-monitoring may empower patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The paper is based on preliminary findings from an ongoing research and innovation project  called "Tele-homecare  chronic patients and the integrated healthcare system" (the TELEKAT project) that employs triple interventions related to patients  professionals  and the organization of care. The ways COPD patients make use of home tele-monitoring in the TELEKAT project points to the relevance of a concept of empowerment rooted in ideologies of social action  and focusing on the improvement of both personal and social conditions at the intersection of individual  organizational and community development.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparin for acute coronary syndromes--assessment of a Cochrane review]. In aspirin-treated patients with acute coronary syndromes without ST-segment elevation unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) treatment < 7 days significantly reduce the risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI)  and LMWH furthermore reduces revascularisation. There is a non-significant effect on mortality compared with placebo and an insignificantly increased risk of haemorrhagic complications. No net clinical benefit of LMWH was found compared to UHF  but LMWH has pharmacokinetic advantages. The optimal duration of heparin treatment remains controversial.

Pediatrics,,,A multi-disciplinary education process related to the discharging of children from hospital when the child has been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes--a qualitative study. Worldwide  insulin-dependent type 1 diabetes is one of the most frequently diagnosed long-term endocrine disorders found in children and the incidences of this diseased is still increasing. In Sweden the routines are  according to national guidelines  when the child is diagnosed with type 1 diabetes  the child and its family remains at the hospital for about two weeks. There is limited knowledge about how a diabetes team handles a child and its family from admission to discharge  therefore the purpose of this study was to seek a deeper understanding of how the diabetes team's parent/child education process works  from admission to discharge  among families with a child newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Qualitative data collection was used. Four focus-group interviews  with a sample of three diabetes teams from different paediatric hospitals in the south western part of Sweden  were conducted and the data recorded on tape and then analysed using qualitative content analysis. The results indicate that achieving a status of self-care on the part of the patient is the goal of the diabetes education programme. Part of the programme is aimed at guiding the child and its parents towards self-help through the means of providing them with knowledge of the disease and its treatment to enable the whole family to understand the need for cooperation in the process. To do this requires an understanding  by the diabetes team  of the individualities of the family in order to gain an overall picture. The results of this study show that the diabetes education programme is specifically designed for each family using the internationally recommended clinical practice guidelines with its specific aims and objectives. Achieving the families' willingness to assist in the self-care of the child care is the goal of the parent education process. To achieve this  the paediatric diabetes specialist nurse and the diabetes specialist paediatrician immediately and deliberately start the process of educating the family using a programme designed to give them the necessary knowledge and skills they will need to manage their child's type 1 diabetes at home.
General Practice,,,Measurement of blood pressure  ankle blood pressure and calculation of ankle brachial index in general practice. Low ankle brachial index (ABI) is a sensitive measure of 'burden' of atherosclerosis  indicating cardiovascular risk of the asymptomatic patient. Conventionally  ABI values <0.90 are considered pathological  indicating peripheral arterial disease. The purpose of this study was to establish whether GPs after a short training course can reliably determine ABI compared to assessment in a specialized hospital department. Epidemiological observational study. A total of 6 GPs and 12 general practice nurses from six practices were recruited for the study. Doppler measurements and ABI calculations were performed according to guidelines used by the Department of Nuclear Medicine  Odense University Hospital. On average  blood pressure measurements in general practice yielded lower values than those measured at the hospital. Differences in brachial and ankle blood pressure were -7 mmHg (-43 to 30 mmHg) and -14 mmHg (-63 to 33 mmHg)  respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of ABI in general practice were 1.00 (0.87-1.00) and 0.79 (0.69-0.88)  respectively. Predictive value of ABI measured <0.9 in general practice was 0.62 (0.46-0.76). Findings in general practice and at the Department of Nuclear Medicine were concordant with regard to the threshold value of ABI 0.9. However  this study does not warrant a recommendation of doppler measurements or assessment of ABI as screening or diagnostic procedure due to low specificity of assessments in general practice. Our results indicate a high number of false-positive tests if the method is applied for screening in general practice.
Epidemiology,,,The causal role of smoking on the risk of hip or knee replacement due to primary osteoarthritis: a Mendelian randomisation analysis of the HUNT study. Smoking has been associated with a reduced risk of hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA) and subsequent joint replacement. The aim of the present study was to assess whether the observed association is likely to be causal. 55 745 participants of a population-based cohort were genotyped for the rs1051730 C > T single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)  a proxy for smoking quantity among smokers. A Mendelian randomization analysis was performed using rs1051730 as an instrument to evaluate the causal role of smoking on the risk of hip or knee replacement (combined as total joint replacement (TJR)). Association between rs1051730 T alleles and TJR was estimated by hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All analyses were adjusted for age and sex. Smoking quantity (no. of cigarettes) was inversely associated with TJR (HR 0.97  95% CI 0.97-0.98). In the Mendelian randomization analysis  rs1051730 T alleles were associated with reduced risk of TJR among current smokers (HR 0.84  95% CI 0.76-0.98  per T allele)  however we found no evidence of association among former (HR 0.97  95% CI 0.88-1.07) and never smokers (HR 0.97  95% CI 0.89-1.06). Neither adjusting for body mass index (BMI)  cardiovascular disease (CVD) nor accounting for the competing risk of mortality substantially changed the results. This study suggests that smoking may be causally associated with the reduced risk of TJR. Our findings add support to the inverse association found in previous observational studies. More research is needed to further elucidate the underlying mechanisms of this causal association.
Anesthesiology,,,Standard operating procedure changed pre-hospital critical care anaesthesiologists' behaviour: a quality control study. The ability of standard operating procedures to improve pre-hospital critical care by changing pre-hospital physician behaviour is uncertain. We report data from a prospective quality control study of the effect on pre-hospital critical care anaesthesiologists' behaviour of implementing a standard operating procedure for pre-hospital controlled ventilation. Anaesthesiologists from eight pre-hospital critical care teams in the Central Denmark Region prospectively registered pre-hospital advanced airway-management data according to the Utstein-style template. We collected pre-intervention data from February 1st 2011 to January 31st 2012  implemented the standard operating procedure on February 1st 2012 and collected post intervention data from February 1st 2012 until October 31st 2012. We included transported patients of all ages in need of controlled ventilation treated with pre-hospital endotracheal intubation or the insertion of a supraglottic airways device. The objective was to evaluate whether the development and implementation of a standard operating procedure for controlled ventilation during transport could change pre-hospital critical care anaesthesiologists' behaviour and thereby increase the use of automated ventilators in these patients. The implementation of a standard operating procedure increased the overall prevalence of automated ventilator use in transported patients in need of controlled ventilation from 0.40 (0.34-0.47) to 0.74 (0.69-0.80) with a prevalence ratio of 1.85 (1.57-2.19) (p = 0.00). The prevalence of automated ventilator use in transported traumatic brain injury patients in need of controlled ventilation increased from 0.44 (0.26-0.62) to 0.85 (0.62-0.97) with a prevalence ratio of 1.94 (1.26-3.0) (p = 0.0039). The prevalence of automated ventilator use in patients transported after return of spontaneous circulation following pre-hospital cardiac arrest increased from 0.39 (0.26-0.48) to 0.69 (0.58-0.78) with a prevalence ratio of 1.79 (1.36-2.35) (p = 0.00). We have shown that the implementation of a standard operating procedure for pre-hospital controlled ventilation can significantly change pre-hospital critical care anaesthesiologists' behaviour.
Anesthesiology,,,Refraining from pre-hospital advanced airway management: a prospective observational study of critical decision making in an anaesthesiologist-staffed pre-hospital critical care service. We report prospectively recorded observational data from consecutive cases in which the attending pre-hospital critical care anaesthesiologist considered performing pre-hospital advanced airway management but decided to withhold such interventions. Anaesthesiologists from eight pre-hospital critical care teams in the Central Denmark Region (a mixed rural and urban region with 1.27 million inhabitants) registered data from February 1st 2011 to October 31st 2012. Included were patients of all ages for whom pre-hospital advanced airway management were considered but not performed. The main objectives were to investigate (1) the pre-hospital critical care anaesthesiologists' reasons for considering performing pre-hospital advanced airway management in this group of patients (2) the pre-hospital critical care anaesthesiologists' reasons for not performing pre-hospital advanced airway management (3) the methods used to treat these patients (4) the incidence of complications related to pre-hospital advanced airway management not being performed. We registered data from 1081 cases in which the pre-hospital critical care anaesthesiologists' considered performing pre-hospital advanced airway management. The anaesthesiologists decided to withhold pre-hospital advanced airway management in 32.1% of these cases (n = 347). In 75.1% of these cases (n = 257) pre-hospital advanced airway management were withheld because of the patient's condition and in 30.8% (n = 107) because of patient co-morbidity. The most frequently used alternative treatment was bag-mask ventilation  used in 82.7% of the cases (n = 287). Immediate complications related to the decision of not performing pre-hospital advanced airway management occurred in 0.6% of the cases (n = 2). We have illustrated the complexity of the critical decision-making associated with pre-hospital advanced airway management. This study is the first to identify the most common reasons why pre-hospital critical care anaesthesiologists sometimes choose to abstain from pre-hospital advanced airway management as well as the alternative treatment methods used.
Anesthesiology,,,Pre-hospital advanced airway management by experienced anaesthesiologists: a prospective descriptive study. We report data from the first Utstein-style study of physician-provided pre-hospital advanced airway management. Anaesthesiologists from eight pre-hospital critical care teams in the Central Denmark Region (a mixed rural and urban region with 1.27 million inhabitants) prospectively registered data according to the template for reporting data from pre-hospital advanced airway management. Data collection took place from February 1st 2011 to October 31st 2012. Included were patients of all ages on whom pre-hospital advanced airway management was performed. The objective was to estimate the incidences of failed and difficult pre-hospital endotracheal intubation  and complications related to pre-hospital advanced airway management. The overall incidence of successful pre-hospital endotracheal intubation among 636 intubation attempts was 99.7%  even though 22.4% of pre-hospital endotracheal intubations required more than one intubation attempt. The overall incidence of complications related to pre-hospital advanced airway management was 7.9%. Following rapid sequence intubation  the incidence of first pass success was 85.8%  the overall incidence of complications was 22.0%  the incidence of hypotension 7.3% and that of hypoxia 5.3%. Multiple endotracheal intubation attempts were associated with an increased overall incidence of complications. No airway management related deaths occurred. The overall incidence of successful pre-hospital endotracheal intubations compares to those found in other physician-staffed pre-hospital systems. The incidence of pre-hospital endotracheal intubations requiring more than one attempt is higher than suspected. The incidence of hypotension or hypoxia after pre-hospital rapid sequence intubation compares to those found in UK emergency departments. Pre-hospital advanced airway management including pre-hospital endotracheal intubation performed by experienced anaesthesiologists is associated with high success rates and relatively low incidences of complications. An increased first pass success rate following pre-hospital endotracheal intubation may further reduce the incidence of complications and enhance patient safety in our system.
Emergency Medicine,,,EMS-physicians' self reported airway management training and expertise; a descriptive study from the Central Region of Denmark. Prehospital advanced airway management  including prehospital endotracheal intubation is challenging and recent papers have addressed the need for proper training  skill maintenance and quality control for emergency medical service personnel. The aim of this study was to provide data regarding airway management-training and expertise from the regional physician-staffed emergency medical service (EMS). The EMS in this part of The Central Region of Denmark is a two tiered system. The second tier comprises physician staffed Mobile Emergency Care Units. The medical directors of the programs supplied system data. A questionnaire addressing airway management experience  training and knowledge was sent to the EMS-physicians. There are no specific guidelines  standard operating procedures or standardised program for obtaining and maintaining skills regarding prehospital advanced airway management in the schemes covered by this study. 53/67 physicians responded; 98 1% were specialists in anesthesiology  with an average of 17 6 years of experience in anesthesiology  and 7 2 years experience as EMS-physicians. 84 9% reported having attended life support course(s)  64 2% an advanced airway management course. 24 5% fulfilled the curriculum suggested for Danish EMS physicians. 47 2% had encountered a difficult or impossible PHETI  most commonly in a patient in cardiac arrest or a trauma patient. Only 20 8% of the physicians were completely familiar with what back-up devices were available for airway management. In this  the first Danish study of prehospital advanced airway management  we found a high degree of experience  education and training among the EMS-physicians  but their equipment awareness was limited. Check-outs  guidelines  standard operating procedures and other quality control measures may be needed.
Telemedicine,,,Urban and rural implementation of pre-hospital diagnosis and direct referral for primary percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the preferred treatment for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The distance to primary PCI centres and the inherent time delay in delivering primary PCI  however  limit widespread use of this treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of pre-hospital diagnosis on time from emergency medical services contact to balloon inflation (system delay) in an unselected cohort of patients with STEMI recruited from a large geographical area comprising both urban and rural districts. From February 2004 until January 2007  data on pre-hospital timing and transport distance were prospectively recorded. Patients were divided into groups depending on achievement of pre-hospital diagnosis and/or direct referral to a primary PCI centre. Seven hundred and fifty-nine consecutive STEMI patients were included. In patients with a pre-hospital diagnosis and direct referral  the system delay was 92 vs. 153 min in patients without pre-hospital diagnosis (P < 0.001). Patients from rural areas were transported a median of 30 km longer than patients from urban areas; however  this prolonged the system delay by only 9 min. Pre-hospital electrocardiographic (ECG) diagnosis and direct referral for primary PCI enables STEMI patients living far from a PCI centre to achieve a system delay comparable with patients living in close vicinity of a PCI centre.
Pharmacogenetics,,,[The influence of genetic variations on the effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]. The outcome of psychopharmacological treatment may depend on genetic polymorphisms of various neurotransmitter systems. We summarize studies of associations between genetic variations with relation to the serotonin system and response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The results are still preliminary but suggest that treatment response to antidepressant drugs is influenced by genetic factors. They also indicate that the genetic component is polygenic and highly complex and might manifest itself in interaction with other biological and environmental factors.
General Practice,,,Almost half of the Danish general practitioners have negative a priori attitudes towards a mandatory accreditation programme. The objective of this study was to analyse Danish general practitioners' (GPs) a priori attitudes and expectations towards a nationwide mandatory accreditation programme. This study is based on a nationwide electronic survey comprising all Danish GPs (n = 3 403). A total of 1 906 (56%) GPs completed the questionnaire. In all  861 (45%) had a negative attitude towards accreditation  whereas 429 (21%) were very positive or posi-tive. The negative attitudes towards accreditation were associated with being older  male and with working in a singlehanded practice. A regional difference was observed as well. GPs with negative expectations were more likely to agree that accreditation was a tool meant for external control (odds ratio (OR) = 1.87 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.18-2.95))  less likely to agree that accreditation was a tool for quality improvement (OR = 0.018 (95% CI: 0.013-0.025))  more likely to agree that it would affect job satisfaction negatively (OR = 21.88 (95% CI: 16.10-29.72))  and they were generally less satisfied with their present job situation (OR = 2.51 (95% CI: 1.85-3.41)). Almost half of the GPs had negative attitudes towards accreditation. The three Research Units for General Practice in Odense  Aarhus and Copenhagen initiated and funded this study. The survey was recommended by the Danish Multipractice Committee (MPU 02-2015) and evaluated by the Danish Data Agency (2015-41-3684).
General Practice,,,Lifestyle factors and contact to general practice with respiratory alarm symptoms-a population-based study. A prerequisite for early lung cancer diagnosis is that individuals with respiratory alarm symptoms (RAS) contact a general practitioner (GP). This study aims to determine the proportion of individuals in the general population who contact a GP with RAS and to analyse the association between lifestyle factors and contact to GPs with RAS. A web-based survey of 100 000 individuals randomly selected from the Danish Civil Registration System. Items regarding experience of RAS (prolonged coughing  shortness of breath  coughing up blood  and prolonged hoarseness)  GP contacts  and lifestyle factors (smoking status  alcohol intake  and body mass index) were included. In total 49 706 (52.5%) individuals answered the questionnaire. Overall 7870 reported at least one respiratory alarm symptom  and of those 39.6% (3 080) had contacted a GP. Regarding specific symptoms  the proportion of individuals that had contacted a GP varied from 27.4% (prolonged hoarseness) to 47.9% (shortness of breath). Being a woman and increasing age were significantly associated with a higher proportion of GP contacts. For both genders  current smoking and alcohol intake were significantly associated with lower odds of contacting a GP. Among individuals with RAS  less than one-half contacted a GP. Gender  age  smoking status  and alcohol intake significantly influenced whether individuals with RAS contacted a GP. The project has been approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency (journal no. 2011-41-6651 ).
General Practice,,,Associations between patients' risk attitude and their adherence to statin treatment - a population based questionnaire and register study. Poor adherence to medical treatment may have considerable consequences for the patients' health and for healthcare costs to society. The need to understand the determinants for poor adherence has motivated several studies on socio-demographics and comorbidity. Few studies focus on the association between risk attitude and adherence. The aim of the present study was to estimate associations between patients' adherence to statin treatment and different dimensions of risk attitude  and to identify subgroups of patients with poor adherence. Population-based questionnaire and register-based study on a sample of 6393 persons of the general. Danish population aged 20-79. Data on risk attitude were based on 4 items uncovering health-related as well as financial dimensions of risk attitude. They were collected through a web-based questionnaire and combined with register data on redeemed statin prescriptions  sociodemographics and comorbidity. Adherence was estimated by proportion of days covered using a cut-off point at 80 %. For the dimension of health-related risk attitude  "Preference for GP visit when having symptoms"  risk-neutral and risk-seeking patients had poorer adherence than the risk-averse patients  OR 0.80 (95 %-CI 0.68-0.95) and OR 0.83 (95 %-CI 0.71-0.98)  respectively. No significant association was found between adherence and financial risk attitude. Further  patients in the youngest age group and patients with no CVD were less adherent to statin treatment. We find some indication that risk attitude is associated with adherence to statin treatment  and that risk-neutral and risk-seeking patients may have poorer adherence than risk-averse patients. This is important for clinicians to consider when discussing optimal treatment decisions with their patients. The identified subgroups with the poorest adherence may deserve special attention from their GP regarding statin treatment.
Global Health,,,[Can strategy for primary health care be revitalized 30 years after Alma-Ata?]. Thirty years ago the Alma-Ata declaration on primary health care was developed. Implementation has been compounded by inadequate financing  changing disease patterns and immature health systems  and there is an ongoing discussion between selective and comprehensive primary health care supporters. Globally  child mortality for under-five-year-olds has been reduced by 50%  but there are still large regional differences. This year the WHO development report is about revitalisation of the primary health care strategy. Recognition of this strategy may be the best instrument to improve health globally.
Forensic Medicine,,,Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry determination of LSD  ISO-LSD  and the main metabolite 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD in forensic samples and application in a forensic case. A liquid chromatography mass spectrometric (LC/MS/MS) method has been developed for the determination of LSD  iso-LSD and the metabolite 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD in forensic applications. The procedure involves liquid-liquid extraction of the analytes and LSD-D3 (internal standard) from 1.0 g whole blood or 1.0 ml urine with butyl acetate at pH 9.8. Confirmation and quantification were done by positive electrospray ionisation with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operating in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. Two MRM transitions of each compound were established and identification criteria were set up based on the retention time and the ion ratio. The curves of extracted standards were linear over a working range of 0.01-50 microg/kg for all transitions of LSD and iso-LSD. The limit of quantification was 0.01 microg/kg for LSD and iso-LSD. The method was applied to a case investigation involving a 26-year-old male suspected for having attempted homicide  where blood concentrations of LSD and iso-LSD were determined to 0.27 and 0.44 microg/kg  respectively. 2-Oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD was detected in the urine and confirmed the LSD abuse. The case illustrated the importance of analyte separation before MRM detection of a sample due to identical fragmentation ions of the isomers.
Toxicology,,,Assessment of in vivo systemic toxicity and biodistribution of iron-doped silica nanoshells. Silica nanoparticles are an emerging class of biomaterials which may be used as diagnostic and therapeutic tools for biomedical applications. In particular  hollow silica nanoshells are attractive due to their hollow core. Approximately 70% of a 500 nm nanoshell is hollow  therefore more particles can be administered on a mg/kg basis compared to solid nanoparticles. Additionally  their nanoporous shell permits influx/efflux of gases and small molecules. Since the size  shape  and composition of a nanoparticle can dramatically alter its toxicity and biodistribution  the toxicology of these nanomaterials was assessed. A single dose toxicity study was performed in vivo to assess the toxicity of 500 nm iron-doped silica nanoshells at clinically relevant doses of 10-20 mg/kg. This study showed that only a trace amount of silica was detected in the body 10 weeks post-administration. The hematology  biochemistry and pathological results show that the nanoshells exhibit no acute or chronic toxicity in mice.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Vascular access management 1: an overview. Vascular access for renal replacement therapy (RRT) is seen as one of the most challenging areas confronting the nephrology multidisciplinary team. The vascular access of choice is the arterio-venous fistula (AVF) followed by the arterio-venous graft (AVG) and central venous catheter (CVC). A successful vascular access programme requires forward planning ensuring that enough time is available for the preservation of the access site  its creation and maturation. Successful cannulation of the vascular access requires on the part of the nephrology nurse  clinical expertise and knowledge on the management of different types of vascular access including different cannulation techniques.
Molecular Epidemiology,,,Molecular and epidemiological profiles of hepatitis C virus genotype 4 in Denmark. The prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 4 has increased throughout Europe. This is an epidemiological study of patients infected chronically with HCV genotype 4 in Denmark. The HCV strains analyzed originated from patient samples collected between 1999 and 2007 as part of the national Danish hepatitis B and C network  DANHEP. Sequence analyses were based on the envelope 1 region of HCV. Results from a total of 72 patients indicated a high degree of genetic heterogeneity. Fifty-six patients (78%) were infected with one of the three dominating subtypes: 4d  4a  or 4r. The remaining 16 patients (22%) were infected with subtypes 4h  4k  4l  4n  4o  or 4Unclassified. Three epidemiological profiles were identified: (1) patients infected with HCV by intravenous drug use were infected solely with subtype 4d. They were all of European origin  and 15 of the 16 patients were ethnic Danes. No single transmission event could be confirmed  but the pairwise nucleotide identity within the patients of Danish origin was relatively high (∼95%)  suggesting a recent introduction into Denmark. (2) The 21 patients infected with subtype 4a all came from Northern Africa  Egypt  Pakistan  or the Middle East. (3) Patients from Southern Africa dominated among patients infected with subtype 4r (10 of 12 patients). This study demonstrates that HCV genotype 4d has been introduced in and spread among Danish intravenous drug users. The remaining subtypes show restricted distribution  infecting almost exclusively patients from geographical areas with a relatively high prevalence of HCV genotype 4 infections.
Global Health,,,A systematic review on the safety and efficacy of percutaneous edge-to-edge mitral valve repair with the MitraClip system for high surgical risk candidates. MitraClip implantation has emerged as a viable option in high surgical risk patients with severe mitral regurgitation (MR). We performed the present systematic review to assess the safety and efficacy of the MitraClip system for high surgical risk candidates with severe organic and/or functional MR. Six electronic databases were searched for original published studies from January 2000 to March 2013. Two reviewers independently appraised studies  using a standard form  and extracted data on methodology  quality criteria  and outcome measures. All data were extracted and tabulated from the relevant articles' texts  tables  and figures and checked by another reviewer. Overall 111 publications were identified. After applying selection criteria and removing serial publications with accumulating number of patients or increased length of follow-up  12 publications with the most complete dataset were included for quality appraisal and data extraction. All 12 studies were prospective observational studies. Immediate procedural success ranged from 72-100%; 30 day mortality ranged from 0-7.8%. There was a significant improvement in haemodynamic profile and functional status after implantation. One year survival ranged from 75-90%. No long term outcomes have been reported for high surgical risk patients. MitraClip implantation is an option in managing selected high surgical risk patients with severe MR. The current evidence suggests that MitraClip can be implanted with reproducible safety and feasibility profile in this subgroup of patients. Further prospective trials with mid- to long-term follow-up are required.
Radiology,,,[One third of Danish doctors specializing in diagnostic radiology do not feel sufficiently equipped in terms of medical expertise]. An internet-based survey among Danish doctors specializing in diagnostic radiology revealed differences with respect to the length of internships at regional and university hospitals as well as the educational environment. The university hospitals were generally evaluated to have the best educational facilities except within practical skills. Therefore  it seems necessary to optimize the educational environment at regional hospitals  especially within medical expertise and scientific skills which are key elements regarding continuous development and quality assurance within radiology.
General Surgery,,,Is current surgical training efficient? A national survey. Evaluation of surgical training in Denmark is competency based with no requirement for a specific number of procedures. This may affect monitoring of surgical progress adversely and cause an underestimation of the time needed to acquire surgical competencies. We investigated the number of common surgical procedures performed by trainees. Trainees' and consultants' expectations from the training program were also investigated. A questionnaire was sent to all 115 surgical trainees in Denmark. We asked how many common surgical procedures the trainees had performed during their postgraduate training  whether self-reported procedural confidence was achieved during their training  and whether their training expectations were met. Another questionnaire dealt with the consultants' expectations of the surgical training. The total number of common surgical procedures (Lichtenstein hernia repair  appendectomy  laparoscopic appendectomy  and laparoscopic cholecystectomy) that were performed varied between trainees. One group performed few common procedures during training. A low number in 1 procedure correlated with a similar pattern in other procedures. Approximately one-third did not perform common elective procedures independently until their fifth year. Consultants and trainees viewed training differently. Our study reveals no common trend in the numbers and types of procedures performed during training. The number of procedures seems to reflect the individual trainee and a local tradition rather than the particular training program. An informal competency-based assessment system with lack of quantitative requirements evidently involves a risk of skewness in training.
Occupational Therapy,,,A decision-algorithm defining the rehabilitation approach: 'Facial oral tract therapy'. The aim of this study was to describe and define the rehabilitation approach: 'Facial Oral Tract Therapy' (F.O.T.T.). We defined the content and process of the rehabilitation approach (F.O.T.T.) in a decision-algorithm supported by a manual with supplementary material. The algorithm was developed by a research occupational therapist and an F.O.T.T. senior instructor. We used an inductive approach combining existing knowledge from: F.O.T.T. instructors  therapists trained in using the F.O.T.T. approach  and existing literature. A group of F.O.T.T. instructors and the originator of the treatment approach Mrs. Kay Coombes has given comments to and approved the algorithm. The algorithm consist of five flowcharts: 'one assessment' chart guiding the therapist in the examination of the patient and four 'treatment charts'  one for each of the four areas of F.O.T.T.: swallowing and eating; oral hygiene; breathing  voice  and speech articulation; facial expression  giving guidance on interventions. The algorithm outlines all important components in the treatment that the therapist should decide to use or not to use in the intervention. The algorithm is supported by a manual with criteria of when to use which components. This algorithm is designed to be a practical guideline to therapists using F.O.T.T. in clinical practice and in educational settings. The use of this algorithm may support standardization of F.O.T.T. and thereby promote and maintain the quality in the treatment. This in turn will facilitate research that addresses F.O.T.T. and outcomes.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Evidence-based surgical techniques for caesarean section]. Caesarean section (CS) is a common surgical procedure  and in Denmark 21% of deliveries is by CS. There is an increasing amount of scientific evidence to support the different surgical techniques used at CS. This article reviews the literature regarding CS techniques. There is still a lack of evidence especially about the long-term consequences of the surgical techniques.
Global Health,,,A summary of the new GINA strategy: a roadmap to asthma control. Over the past 20 years  the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) has regularly published and annually updated a global strategy for asthma management and prevention that has formed the basis for many national guidelines. However  uptake of existing guidelines is poor. A major revision of the GINA report was published in 2014  and updated in 2015  reflecting an evolving understanding of heterogeneous airways disease  a broader evidence base  increasing interest in targeted treatment  and evidence about effective implementation approaches. During development of the report  the clinical utility of recommendations and strategies for their practical implementation were considered in parallel with the scientific evidence.This article provides a summary of key changes in the GINA report  and their rationale. The changes include a revised asthma definition; tools for assessing symptom control and risk factors for adverse outcomes; expanded indications for inhaled corticosteroid therapy; a framework for targeted treatment based on phenotype  modifiable risk factors  patient preference  and practical issues; optimisation of medication effectiveness by addressing inhaler technique and adherence; revised recommendations about written asthma action plans; diagnosis and initial treatment of the asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome; diagnosis in wheezing pre-school children; and updated strategies for adaptation and implementation of GINA recommendations.
Medicine,,,"Gharikon"/"Agharikon" a Valuable Medicinal Mushroom in Iranian Traditional Medicine. Gharikon is a well-known medicinal mushroom in Iranian traditional medicine and mentioned several times in different kinds of authentic literature. Considering both traditional and modern literature  the aim of this study is to present a review of its biological activities. Using online databases (e.g. PubMed  Scopus  and Google Scholar) as well as reviewing traditional medicinal literature (e.g. Makhzan-ul-Adwiah  Al-Qanun fi al-Tibb); we reviewed the published literature on the pharmacological effects of Laricifomes officinalis (the most common species considered as "Gharikon"). Laricifomes officinalis (Polyporus officinalis) is a wood-rotting fungus that grows on different hosts such as conifers. The mushroom is native to Europe  Asia  and North America. According to the judgment of traditional medicine  its temperament is warm and dry. It has been used since the ancient times to treat sciatica  weakness of muscles  bronchitis  constipation  stomach and uterus pain  jaundice  fever and insect bites. It also has diuretic and emmenagogue effects. In recent decades  several research studies have been performed on L. officinalis. The results showed that the biological effects of L. officinalis are anti-viral (especially against smallpox  H5N1 influenza  and hepatitis C virus)  anti-tuberculosis  boosting the immune system  treating dysmenorrhea  hemorrhoids  cough  rheumatoid arthritis and anticoagulant activity. A survey revealed that L. officinalis is a well-known medicinal mushroom with some formulations as dietary supplements on the market. Considering traditional literature and recent findings on biological activities that in most cases corroborate each other  it seems that Laricifomes officinalis needs more attention in new investigations  including more pharmacologic assays and clinical trials  which may lead to the development of new natural products.
Global Health,,,Serous ovarian  fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancers: a common disease or separate entities - a systematic review. The aim of this systematic review is to analyze data on risk factors  epidemiology  clinicopathology and molecular biology from studies comparing primary peritoneal cancer  fallopian tube cancer and ovarian cancer of serous histology  in order to achieve a greater understanding of whether or not these disorders should be considered as separate entities. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed and MEDLINE. Case-control studies comparing primary serous peritoneal or fallopian tube carcinomas with primary serous ovarian carcinomas or a control group were included. Twenty-eight studies were found eligible. Primary peritoneal cancer patients were older  had higher parity  were more often obese and had poorer survival compared to ovarian cancer patients. Differences in protein expression patterns of Her2/neu  estrogen and progestin receptors and frequency of loss of heterozygosity differed between primary peritoneal cancer and primary ovarian cancer patients. No major differences were found between primary fallopian tube cancer and primary ovarian cancer. The proportion of serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas (STIC) was lower in primary peritoneal cancer and primary ovarian cancer compared to primary fallopian tube cancer. Except from differences in the proportion of STIC only few differences between primary fallopian tube cancer and primary ovarian cancer have been found. In contrast  observed differences in risk factor profile  clinicopathologic and prognostic factors  as well as in the molecular patterns  indicate that peritoneal cancer and ovarian cancer may be linked to different carcinogenic pathways.
Pharmacogenetics,,,Pharmacogenetic Risk Stratification in Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor-Treated Patients with Congestive Heart Failure: A Retrospective Cohort Study. Evidence for pharmacogenetic risk stratification of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) treatment is limited. Therefore  in a cohort of ACEI-treated patients with congestive heart failure (CHF)  we investigated the predictive value of two pharmacogenetic scores that previously were found to predict ACEI efficacy in patients with ischemic heart disease and hypertension  respectively. Score A combined single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the angiotensin II receptor type 1 gene (rs275651 and rs5182) and the bradykinin receptor B1 gene (rs12050217). Score B combined SNPs of the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene (rs4343) and ABO blood group genes (rs495828 and rs8176746). Danish patients with CHF enrolled in the previously reported Echocardiography and Heart Outcome Study were included. Subjects were genotyped and categorized according to pharmacogenetic scores A and B of ≤1  2 and ≥3 each  and followed for up to 10 years. Difference in cumulative incidences of cardiovascular death and all-cause death were assessed by the cumulative incidence estimator. Survival was modeled by Cox proportional hazard analyses. We included 667 patients  of whom 80% were treated with ACEIs. Differences in cumulative incidences of cardiovascular death (P = 0.346 and P = 0.486) and all-cause death (P = 0.515 and P = 0.486) were not significant for score A and B  respectively. There was no difference in risk of cardiovascular death or all-cause death between subjects with score A ≤1 vs. 2 (HR 1.03 [95% CI 0.79-1.34] and HR 1.11 [95% CI 0.88-1.42])  score A ≤1 vs. ≥3 (HR 0.80 [95% CI 0.59-1.08] and HR 0.91 [95% CI 0.70-1.20])  score B ≤1 vs. 2 (HR 1.02 [95% CI 0.78-1.32] and HR 0.98 [95% CI 0.77-1.24])  and score B ≤1 vs. ≥3 (HR 1.03 [95% CI 0.75-1.41] and HR 1.05 [95% CI 0.79-1.40])  respectively. We found no association between either of the analyzed pharmacogenetic scores and fatal outcomes in ACEI-treated patients with CHF.
Precision Medicine,,,Individualised therapy is more cost-effective than dose intensification in patients with Crohn's disease who lose response to anti-TNF treatment: a randomised  controlled trial. Although the reasons for secondary loss of response to infliximab (IFX) maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease vary  dose intensification is usually recommended. This study investigated the cost-effectiveness of interventions defined by an algorithm designed to identify specific reasons for therapeutic failure. Randomised  controlled  single-blind  multicentre study. 69 patients with secondary IFX failure were randomised to IFX dose intensification (5 mg/kg every 4 weeks) (n=36) or interventions based on serum IFX and IFX antibody levels using the proposed algorithm (n=33). Predefined co-primary end points at week 12 were proportion of patients responding (Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) decrease ≥ 70  or ≥ 50% reduction in active fistulas) and accumulated costs related to treatment of Crohn's disease  expressed as mean cost per patient  based on the Danish National Patient Registry for all hospitalisation and outpatient costs in the Danish healthcare sector. Costs for intention-to-treat patients were substantially lower (34%) for those treated in accordance with the algorithm than by IFX dose intensification: € 6038 vs € 9178  p<0.001. However  disease control  as judged by response rates  was similar: 58% and 53%  respectively  p=0.81; difference 5% (-19% to 28%). For per-protocol patients  treatment costs were even lower (56%) in the algorithm-treated group (€ 4062 vs € 9178  p<0.001) and with similar response rates (47% vs 53%  p=0.78; difference -5% (-33% to 22%)). Treatment of secondary IFX failure using an algorithm based on combined IFX and IFX antibody measurements significantly reduces average treatment costs per patient compared with routine IFX dose escalation and without any apparent negative effect on clinical efficacy. NCT00851565.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[5-aminosalicylic acid for induction of remission or clinical response in Crohn's disease--a survey of a Cochrane review]. A systematic review to evaluate the efficacy of 5-aminosalicylates for induction of remission or clinical response in patients with mild to moderately active Crohn's disease is described. The effect of either high (3 to 4.5 g/day) or low dose (1 to 2 g/day) 5-aminosalicylic acid was similar to that of placebo. Overall  sulfasalazine was not superior to placebo and was inferior to glucocorticoids for the treatment of mild to moderately active Crohn's disease. Neither published nor unpublished data support any use of 5-aminosalicylates for the treatment of Crohn's disease.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Tegaserod in treatment of women with irritable bowel syndrome]. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic  relapsing disease characterised by abdominal pain and altered bowel movements. This review assesses the clinical trials of the partial serotonin receptor agonist tegaserod in women with constipation type IBS. Significantly more women treated with tegaserod obtained sufficient relief from symptoms during at least 2 out of 4 weeks  but the absolute therapeutic gain of approximately 10 percent was not deemed clinically relevant. Two marketing authorisation applications in the European Union have been rejected due to the minor therapeutic gain. Tegaserod was removed from the market in the USA in March 2007 due to an increased risk of severe cardiovascular adverse events.
Epidemiology,,,Mortality  cancer  and comorbidities associated with chronic pancreatitis: a Danish nationwide matched-cohort study. We aimed to assess the risk of death  cancer  and comorbidities among patients with alcoholic and nonalcoholic chronic pancreatitis (CP). We performed a nationwide retrospective cohort study  collecting data from Danish registries from 1995 through 2010. We evaluated the prevalences and incidences of death  cancers  and comorbidities among subjects with CP (cases) compared with age- and sex-matched individuals (controls). In total  11 972 cases (71 814 person-years) and 119 720 controls (917 436 person-years) were included in the analysis. Hazard ratios (HR) were estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression. Forty-six percent of the cases died during the follow-up period  compared with 13.0% of controls (mean age  63.7 vs 72.1 y; P < .0001)  corresponding to a HR of 5.0 for CP (95% confidence interval [CI]  4.8-5.2). Cancer was a frequent cause of death among cases (10.2%) and controls (3.3%). Cancer (particularly pancreatic cancer) was a frequent cause of death among cases; the HR was 6.9 (95% CI  7.5-11.8). Alcoholic CP did not produce a higher risk for cancer or death than nonalcoholic CP. Cerebrovascular disease (HR  1.3; 95% CI  1.2-1.4)  chronic pulmonary disease (HR  1.9; 95% CI  1.8-2.1)  ulcer disease (HR  3.6; 95% CI  3.3-3.9)  diabetes (HR  5.2; 95% CI  5.0-5.6)  and chronic renal disease (HR  1.7; 95% CI  1.5-1.9) occurred more frequently among patients with CP  but myocardial infarction did not (HR  0.9; 95% CI  0.8-1.0). Based on a Danish nationwide cohort study  individuals with CP are at higher risk for death from cancer (particularly pancreatic cancer) and have a higher incidence of comorbidities than people without CP.
Public Health,,,[Physical inactivity--consequences and correlations]. The Danish Fitness and Nutrition Council has examined the scientific literature to evaluate the effects of a physically inactive lifestyle on health in the adult population. Physical inactivity is defined as less than 2.5 hours of moderately intense activity per week. 30-40% of the adult Danish population is defined as physically inactive. A physically inactive lifestyle has a negative impact on metabolic and cardio-vascular functions and increases the risk of developing lifestyle diseases. Furthermore  physical inactivity increases the risk of disability among the elderly.
Epidemiology,,,Predictive validity of the ASAS classification criteria for axial and peripheral spondyloarthritis after follow-up in the ASAS cohort: a final analysis. To establish the predictive validity of the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) spondyloarthritis (SpA) classification criteria. 22 centres (N=909 patients) from the initial 29 ASAS centres (N=975) participated in the ASAS-cohort follow-up study. Patients had either chronic (>3 months) back pain of unknown origin and age of onset below 45 years (N=658) or peripheral arthritis and/or enthesitis and/or dactylitis (N=251). At follow-up  information was obtained at a clinic visit or by telephone. The positive predictive value (PPV) of the baseline classification by the ASAS criteria was calculated using rheumatologist's diagnosis at follow-up as external standard. In total  564 patients were assessed at follow-up (345 visits; 219 telephone) with a mean follow-up of 4.4 years (range: 1.9; 6.8) and 70.2% received a SpA diagnosis by the rheumatologist. 335 patients fulfilled the axial SpA (axSpA) or peripheral SpA (pSpA) criteria at baseline and of these  309 were diagnosed SpA after follow-up (PPV SpA criteria: 92.2%). The PPV of the axSpA and pSpA criteria was 93.3% and 89.5%  respectively. The PPV for the 'clinical arm only' was 88.0% and for the 'clinical arm'±'imaging arm' 96.0%  for the 'imaging arm only' 86.2% and for the 'imaging arm'+/-'clinical arm' 94.7%. A series of sensitivity analyses yielded similar results (range: 85.1-98.2%). The PPV of the axSpA and pSpA criteria to forecast an expert's diagnosis of 'SpA' after more than 4 years is excellent. The 'imaging arm' and 'clinical arm' of the axSpA criteria have similar predictive validity and are truly complementary.
Rheumatology,,,Treatment with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors in axial spondyloarthritis: comparison between private rheumatology practices and academic centers in a large observational cohort. To evaluate the initiation of and response to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors for axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) in private rheumatology practices versus academic centers. We compared newly initiated TNF inhibition for axSpA in 363 patients enrolled in private practices with 100 patients recruited in 6 university hospitals within the Swiss Clinical Quality Management (SCQM) cohort. All patients had been treated with ≥ 1 nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug and > 70% of patients had a baseline Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) ≥ 4 before anti-TNF agent initiation. The proportion of patients with nonradiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA) treated with TNF inhibitors was higher in hospitals versus private practices (30.4% vs 18.7%  p = 0.02). The burden of disease as assessed by patient-reported outcomes at baseline was slightly higher in the hospital setting. Mean levels (± SD) of the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score were  however  virtually identical in private practices and academic centers (3.4 ± 1.0 vs 3.4 ± 0.9  p = 0.68). An Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS40) response at 1 year was reached for ankylosing spondylitis in 51.7% in private practices and 52.9% in university hospitals (p = 1.0) and for nr-axSpA in 27.5% versus 25.0%  respectively (p = 1.0). With the exception of a lower proportion of patients with nr-axSpA newly treated with anti-TNF agents in private practices in comparison to academic centers  adherence to ASAS treatment recommendations for TNF inhibition was equally high  and similar response rates to TNF blockers were achieved in both clinical settings.
General Practice,,,Prognostic value of electroencephalography (EEG) after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in successfully resuscitated patients used in daily clinical practice. Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is associated with a poor prognosis and predicting outcome is complex with neurophysiological testing and repeated clinical neurological examinations as key components of the assessment. In this study we examine the association between different electroencephalography (EEG) patterns and mortality in a clinical cohort of OHCA-patients. From 2002 to 2011 consecutive patients were admitted to an intensive-care-unit after resuscitation from OHCA. Utstein-criteria for pre-hospital data and review of individual patients' charts for post-resuscitation care were used. EEG reports were analysed according to the 2012 American Clinical Neurophysiology Society's guidelines. A total of 1076 patients were included  and EEG was performed in 20% (n=219) with a median of 3(IQR 2-4) days after OHCA. Rhythmic Delta Activity (RDA) was found in 71 patients (36%) and Periodic Discharges (PD) in 100 patients (45%). Background EEG frequency of Alpha+ or Theta was noted in 107 patients (49%)  and change in cerebral EEG activity to stimulation (reactivity) was found in 38 patients (17%). Suppression (all activity <10 μV) was found in 26 (12%) and burst-suppression in 17 (8%) patients. A favourable EEG pattern (reactivity  favourable background frequency and RDA) was independently associated with reduced mortality with hazard ratio (HR) 0.43 (95%CI: 0.24-0.76)  p=0.004 (false positive rate: 31%) and a non-favourable EEG pattern (no reactivity  unfavourable background frequency  and PD  suppressed voltage or burst-suppression) was associated with higher mortality (HR=1.62(1.09-2.41)  p=0.02) after adjustment for known prognostic factors (false positive rate: 9%). EEG may be useful in work-up in prognostication of patients with OHCA. Findings such as Rhythmic Delta Activity (RDA) seem to be associated with a better prognosis  whereas suppressed voltage and burst-suppression patterns were associated with poor prognosis.
Epidemiology,Internal Medicine,,Identifying admitted patients at risk of dying: a prospective observational validation of four biochemical scoring systems. Risk assessment is an important part of emergency patient care. Risk assessment tools based on biochemical data have the advantage that calculation can be automated and results can be easily provided. However  to be used clinically  existing tools have to be validated by independent researchers. This study involved an independent external validation of four risk stratification systems predicting death that rely primarily on biochemical variables. Prospective observational study. The medical admission unit at a regional teaching hospital in Denmark. Of 5894 adult (age 15 or above) acutely admitted medical patients  205 (3.5%) died during admission and 46 died (0.8%) within one calendar day. None. The main outcome measure was the ability to identify patients at an increased risk of dying (discriminatory power) as area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the accuracy of the predicted probability (calibration) using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. The endpoint was all-cause mortality  defined in accordance with the original manuscripts. Using the original coefficients  all four systems were excellent at identifying patients at increased risk (discriminatory power  AUROC ≥0.80). The accuracy was poor (we could assess calibration for two systems  which failed). After recalculation of the coefficients  two systems had improved discriminatory power and two remained unchanged. Calibration failed for one system in the validation cohort. Four biochemical risk stratification systems can risk-stratify the acutely admitted medical patients for mortality with excellent discriminatory power. We could improve the models for use in our setting by recalculating the risk coefficient for the chosen variables.
Emergency Medicine,,,In-hospital resuscitation evaluated by in situ simulation: a prospective simulation study. Interruption in chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation can be characterized as no flow ratio (NFR) and the importance of minimizing these pauses in chest compression has been highlighted recently. Further  documentation of resuscitation performance has been reported to be insufficient and there is a lack of identification of important issues where future efforts might be beneficial. By implementing in situ simulation we created a model to evaluate resuscitation performance. The aims of the study were to evaluate the feasibility of the applied method  and to examine differences in the resuscitation performance between the first responders and the cardiac arrest team. A prospective observational study of 16 unannounced simulated cardiopulmonary arrest scenarios was conducted. The participants of the study involved all health care personel on duty who responded to a cardiac arrest. We measured NFR and time to detection of initial rhythm on defibrillator and performed a comparison between the first responders and the cardiac arrest team. Data from 13 out of 16 simulations was used to evaluate the ability of generating resuscitation performance data in simulated cardiac arrest. The defibrillator arrived after median 214 seconds (180-254) and detected initial rhythm after median 311 seconds (283-349). A significant difference in no flow ratio (NFR) was observed between the first responders  median NFR 38% (32-46)  and the resuscitation teams  median NFR 25% (19-29)  p < 0.001. The difference was significant even after adjusting for pulse and rhythm check and shock delivery. The main finding of this study was a significant difference between the first responders and the cardiac arrest team with the latter performing more adequate cardiopulmonary resuscitation with regards to NFR. Future research should focus on the educational potential for in-situ simulation in terms of improving skills of hospital staff and patient outcome.
Emergency Medicine,,,Risk scoring systems for adults admitted to the emergency department: a systematic review. Patients referred to a medical admission unit (MAU) represent a broad spectrum of disease severity. In the interest of allocating resources to those who might potentially benefit most from clinical interventions  several scoring systems have been proposed as a triaging tool.Even though most scoring systems are not meant to be used on an individual level  they can support the more inexperienced doctors and nurses in assessing the risk of deterioration of their patients.We therefore performed a systematic review on the level of evidence of literature on scoring systems developed or validated in the MAU. We hypothesized that existing scoring systems would have a low level of evidence and only few systems would have been externally validated. We conducted a systematic search using Medline  EMBASE and the Cochrane Library  according to the PRISMA guidelines  on scoring systems developed to assess medical patients at admission.The primary endpoints were in-hospital mortality or transfer to the intensive care unit. Studies derived for only a single or few diagnoses were excluded.The ability to identify patients at risk (discriminatory power) and agreement between observed and predicted outcome (calibration) along with the method of derivation and validation (application on a new cohort) were extracted. We identified 1 655 articles. Thirty were selected for further review and 10 were included in this review.Eight systems used vital signs as variables and two relied mostly on blood tests.Nine systems were derived using regression analysis and eight included patients admitted to a MAU. Six systems used in-hospital mortality as their primary endpoint.Discriminatory power was specified for eight of the scoring systems and was acceptable or better in five of these. The calibration was only specified for four scoring systems. In none of the studies impact analysis or inter-observer reliability were analyzed.None of the systems reached the highest level of evidence. None of the 10 scoring systems presented in this article are perfect and all have their weaknesses. More research is needed before the use of scoring systems can be fully implemented to the risk assessment of acutely admitted medical patients.
Geriatrics,,,European Society for Swallowing Disorders - European Union Geriatric Medicine Society white paper: oropharyngeal dysphagia as a geriatric syndrome. This position document has been developed by the Dysphagia Working Group  a committee of members from the European Society for Swallowing Disorders and the European Union Geriatric Medicine Society  and invited experts. It consists of 12 sections that cover all aspects of clinical management of oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) related to geriatric medicine and discusses prevalence  quality of life  and legal and ethical issues  as well as health economics and social burden. OD constitutes impaired or uncomfortable transit of food or liquids from the oral cavity to the esophagus  and it is included in the World Health Organization's classification of diseases. It can cause severe complications such as malnutrition  dehydration  respiratory infections  aspiration pneumonia  and increased readmissions  institutionalization  and morbimortality. OD is a prevalent and serious problem among all phenotypes of older patients as oropharyngeal swallow response is impaired in older people and can cause aspiration. Despite its prevalence and severity  OD is still underdiagnosed and untreated in many medical centers. There are several validated clinical and instrumental methods (videofluoroscopy and fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing) to diagnose OD  and treatment is mainly based on compensatory measures  although new treatments to stimulate the oropharyngeal swallow response are under research. OD matches the definition of a geriatric syndrome as it is highly prevalent among older people  is caused by multiple factors  is associated with several comorbidities and poor prognosis  and needs a multidimensional approach to be treated. OD should be given more importance and attention and thus be included in all standard screening protocols  treated  and regularly monitored to prevent its main complications. More research is needed to develop and standardize new treatments and management protocols for older patients with OD  which is a challenging mission for our societies.
Radiology,,,Torsten Almén (1931-2016): the father of non-ionic iodine contrast media. The Swedish radiologist Torsten Almén is the first clinical radiologist ever to have made a fundamental contribution to intravascular contrast medium design  the development of non-ionic contrast media. He became emotionally triggered by the patients' severe pain each time he injected the ionic "high-osmolar" contrast media when performing peripheral arteriographies in the early 1960s. One day he got a flash of genius that combined the observation of pain  a pathophysiological theory and how to eliminate it with suitable contrast media chemistry. After self-studies in chemistry he developed the concept of iodine contrast media not dissociating into ions in solution to reduce their osmolality and even reach plasma isotonicity. He offered several pharmaceutical companies his concept of mono- and polymeric non-ionic agents but without response  since it was considered against the chemical laws of that time. Contrast media constructed as salts and dissociating into ions in solution was regarded an absolute necessity to achieve high enough water solubility and concentration for diagnostic purposes. Finally a small Norwegian company  Nyegaard & Co.  took up his idea 1968 and together they developed the essentially painless "low-osmolar" monomeric non-ionic metrizamide (Amipaque) released in 1974 and iohexol (Omipaque) in 1982 followed by the "iso-osmolar" dimeric non-ionic iodixanol (Visipaque) released in 1993. This has implied a profound paradigm shift with regard to reduction of both hypertonic and chemotoxic side effects  which have been a prerequisite for the today's widespread use of contrast medium-enhanced CT and advanced endovascular interventional techniques even in fragile patients.
Community Health Nursing,Family Practice,,Comprehensive discharge follow-up in patients' homes by GPs and district nurses of elderly patients. A randomized controlled trial. Many hospital admissions are due to inappropriate medical treatment  and discharge of fragile elderly patients involves a high risk of readmission. The present study aimed to assess whether a follow-up programme undertaken by GPs and district nurses could improve the quality of the medical treatment and reduce the risk of readmission of elderly newly discharged patients. The patients were randomized to either an intervention group receiving a structured home visit by the GP and the district nurse one week after discharge followed by two contacts after three and eight weeks  or to a control group receiving the usual care. A total of 331 patients aged 78+ years discharged from Glostrup Hospital  Denmark  were included. Readmission rate within 26 weeks after discharge among all randomized patients. Control of medication  evaluated 12 weeks after discharge on 293 (89%) of the patients by an interview at home and by a questionnaire to the GP. Control-group patients were more likely to be readmitted than intervention-group patients (52% v 40%; p = 0.03). In the intervention group  the proportions of patients who used prescribed medication of which the GP was unaware (48% vs. 34%; p = 0.02) and who did not take the medication prescribed by the GP (39% vs. 28%; p = 0.05) were smaller than in the control group. The intervention shows a possible framework securing the follow-up on elderly patients after discharge by reducing the readmission risk and improving medication control.
Family Practice,,,[Support for self-management in chronic disease?]. Self-management is part of chronic care to ensure an informed and activated patient. We scrutinised systematic literature reviews about self-care in general practice. There were effects on clinical and patient related measures and health services utilisation. Most effect was seen in interventions using health care professionals to provide education about action plans and medical treatment. Patient led education did not show effect on clinical outcome but on patient-related measures. We conclude that general practice should implement self-management as part of chronic care.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Blood pressure lowering efficacy of beta-blockers added to monotherapy with a thiazid or a calcium antagonist--a survey of a Cochrane review]. A blood pressure fall of 6-8/4-6 mmHg is seen when a beta-blocker is added to a thiazid or a calcium antagonist. Due to less protection against cardiovascular complications  most likely explained by an insufficient reduction in the central aortic blood pressure profile betablockers  especially atenolol  is no longer first choice treatment for hypertension  unless ischaemic heart disease or heart failure is present.
Epidemiology,,,Venous thromboembolism and risk of cancer in patients with diabetes mellitus. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) has long been regarded as a marker of underlying malignancy in the general population. Patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk of developing VTE  but it is unclear whether VTE in diabetes patients is also a harbinger of occult cancer. From Danish medical health databases  we identified all diabetes patients (N=8783) with a first-time diagnosis of VTE during 1978-2011. We followed the patients until a first-time diagnosis of cancer  emigration  death  or study end  whichever came first. We calculated one-year absolute cancer risk and overall and site-specific standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for cancer based on national cancer incidence. During the total study period 878 cancers were observed. The one-year absolute cancer risk was 4.1% and the corresponding SIR was 3.28 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.94-3.64). The highest SIRs were observed for cancers of the gallbladder and biliary tract (SIR 13.59; 6.77-24.31)  the pancreas (SIR 10.16; 6.85-14.50)  the ovary (SIR 9.85; 5.63-16.00)  and the liver (SIR 9.39; 4.30-17.84). After the first year of follow-up  the overall cancer SIR associated with VTE and diabetes decreased to 1.05 (95% CI: 0.97-1.15). VTE may be a marker of underlying cancer in patients with diabetes mellitus.
General Practice,,,Difficulties in reaching therapeutic goals for hypertension and dysplipidaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes in general practice. National guidelines recommend strict control of blood pressure (BP) and plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) in type 2 diabetes (T2DM)  aiming at a BP ≤ 130/80 mmHg and an LDL concentration ≤ 2.5 mmol/l. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II-receptor blockers (ARB) are recommended as primary antihypertensive therapy (AHT). To which extent these targets are met in Danish primary care is unknown. This study was based on data from 2 057 patients with T2DM who were randomly selected from 64 general practitioners (GPs) from different regions of Denmark. Data were collected from the GPs' electronic records. The mean age ± standard deviation was 66.2 ± 11.6 years; 58.7% were male. The mean systolic BP ± standard deviation was 132.6 ± 14.6 mmHg and the mean diastolic BP ± standard deviation was 78.1 ± 9.0 mmHg. 47.7% of the patients met the BP target. 79.5% of the patients were on AHT. 55.1% of the untreated and 46.0% of the treated patients met the BP target. 83.4% of the treated patients received ACEI or ARB. The median LDL was 2.2 (1.7-2.7) mmol/l. 63.7% of the patients met the LDL target. 73.7% of the patients received lipid-lowering therapy. 32.8% of the untreated and 74.4% of the treated patients met the LDL target. AHT including ACEI and ARB and lipid-lowering therapy are widely used in T2DM in Danish primary care  but only half of the patients are at target for BP and two thirds are at target for LDL. Increased use of diuretics may improve BP control. This study was funded by a grant from Boehringer Ingelheim  Denmark. The grant covered costs related to data collection  time spent by the general practitioners and data analysis by the DTU. not relevant.
General Practice,,,Screening for microalbuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes is incomplete in general practice. National Danish guidelines recommend screening for microalbuminuria with assessment of urinary albumin/creatinine ratio at least annually in patients with type 2 diabetes. To which extent such screening is actually performed is not known. A total of 2 057 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomly selected from 64 general practitioners (GPs) from different geographical areas of Denmark. Clinical and laboratory data on the individual patients were collected through the GPs' electronic medical patient records; particular emphasis was given to annual screening for microalbuminuria. The mean age of the patients was 66.2 ± 11.6 years and 58.7% were male. Only 57.2% of the patients had been screened for microalbuminuria with any method within the preceding 12 months period; of these 76.0% had normo- and 21.0% had microalbuminuria  whereas 3.0% had overt proteinuria. In contrast  97.6% of patients had had a minimum of one plasma-creatinine measurement within the past year. In Danish primary care  screening for microalbuminuria in type 2 diabetes is insufficiently implemented  whereas renal function is evaluated in almost all patients by plasma-creatinine measurements. The importance of diagnosing microalbuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes needs to be emphasised. The project has received funding in the form of a research grant from Boehringer Ingelheim  Denmark. not relevant.
Family Practice,,,[Quality of diabetes education and shared care between family practice and the diabetes clinic]. To evaluate the quality of diabetes group-based education followed by shared care. The diabetes education program includes screening for diabetic complications and a scheme for follow-up is planned. Patients with microvascular complications visit the diabetes clinic four times a year. Patients without microvascular complications visit their general practitioner every third month and the diabetes clinic once a year. Retrospective data of 100 newly-referred patients with Type 2 diabetes with quality standards given in parenthesis. 86% (>80%) of the patients visited our diabetes clinic 2 years after diabetes education and 73% (>80%) visited their general practitioner. After 2 years HbA1c and blood pressure were assessed in 100% of the patients (>95%)  while urinary albumin was measured in 99% (>90%) and eye examinations performed in 95% (>90%) of the patients. HbA1C <7% was found in 55% (60%) 2 years after the diabetes education. HbA1C <8% was found in 83% (>80%) after 2 years after diabetes education. Blood pressure < or =130/80 mmHg was found in 40% 2 years after diabetes education. Blood pressure < or =140/90 mmHg was found in 62% (>80%) 2 years after diabetes education. Permanent micro- and macroalbuminuria was shown in 7% at diabetes education and 3% 2 years later. Total cholesterol <4.5 mmol/l in 57% (>80%) 2 years after diabetes education. The quality of the organization of diabetes care and glycemic control was good. The goals for management of hyperlipidaemia and blood pressure were not accomplished. By means of screening 7% of patients were diagnosed with micro- or macroalbuminuria.
Internal Medicine,,,[Educational project at the medical department  Fredericia Hospital]. The purpose of this project was to introduce a newly developed educational program consisting of a new concept with metacompetences. Our aim was to evaluate the need for new educational methods and to clarify the educational capacity of our clinic. The duration of the project was two years; it was allocated to pre-registration house officers. Part one of the project was a systematic evaluation of the functions of each department  with a focus on educational capacity. The next stage was to introduce new methods into the departments. The project focused on the metacompetences for communication and collaboration evaluated  using a system of supervised rounds. A newly developed questionnaire using a visual analogue scale was used for feedback to the officers in training. The new educational methods scored high in the evaluation  and the pre-registration house officers were able to achieve all the competences in the education program. The implementation of the system took place without major difficulties  and the extra workload allocated to the department was minimal.
Geriatric Nursing,Orthopedics,,[Interdisciplinary geriatric intervention among nursing home residents with hip fracture reduces mortality]. Nursing home residents represent the majority of hip fracture hospitalisation cases. Quick discharge to nursing homes after surgery is common practice. A previous study indicates an increased risk of death immediately after discharge. A total of 211 residents  hospitalised from nursing homes for hip fracture surgery  were selected for a retrospective follow-up study. The orthopaedic ward's geriatric team (GO-team) visited the residents no later than one day after discharge. The number of visits depended on the need for treatment and rehabilitation. Intervention was  among others  focussed on: nutrition  fluid therapy and blood transfusion. Intensive geriatric intervention reduced the 30-day mortality (odds ratio (OR) = 0.08; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.01; 0.52) and reduced 3-month mortality (OR = 0.03; 95% CI: 0.003; 0.25). Fluid therapy and nutritional support were associated with reduced probability of death (OR = 0.12; 95% CI: 0.02; 0.67)/(OR = 0.23; 95% CI: 0.07; 0.79). Non-elective readmissions were reduced (OR = 0.20; 95% CI: 0.04; 0.91). Post-surgical blood transfusion was associated with improved functional ability (beta = 8.22; 95% CI: 1.44; 15.0). Geriatric interdisciplinary intervention among residents in nursing homes has a positive effect and improves survival and reduces non-elective readmission within three months. Still  there is uncertainty about the effect of fluid therapy and blood transfusions and further investigations are needed.
Pediatrics,,,The majority of sick children receive paracetamol during the winter. Even though fever is a common symptom in childhood  it often worries parents and they may try to reduce discomfort by giving the child paracetamol  which is currently the most commonly sold over-the-counter medicine. The objective of this study was to investigate parent-administered paracetamol in toddlers during a winter-period in relation to symptoms  doctor contacts and severity-rated illness. The study was conducted as a prospective diary study covering a three-month winter-period. It comprised a cohort of 183 infants born in February 2001 in a district of the capital area in Denmark. According to the parents  a total of 119 toddlers (65%) received paracetamol at least once during the study period; 9.3% of the toddlers received paracetamol for more than ten days. The administration of paracetamol rose as the number of symptoms increased. Paracetamol was given in 37% of days with fever. The most frequent combinations of symptoms to trigger paracetamol administration were fever and earache with a probability of 64%. For the symptoms of vomiting and earache  the probability was 60%. In the rare cases with monosymptomatic fever  some 23% used paracetamol. The majority of ill toddlers received paracetamol if they had several symptoms. However  paracetamol was administrated in 37% of days with fever. This use of paracetamol seems reasonable as the parents differentiate between degrees of illness and withhold paracetamol until the second day of the illness episode.
Family Practice,,,[General practice research supervision]. General practice is a subject with a relatively short scientific tradition. The purpose of this study was to elucidate who gives long-cycle general practice research supervision in Denmark  who is supervised and how research students get on. All research students with research advisers in the field of general practice filled out a questionnaire in 1997 (n = 50) and 2003 (n = 52). There were questions about project/research training  professional education  advisers and the students' attitude to taking on advisory functions in the future. In 2003  48 of those from the 1997 cohort also answered a follow-up questionnaire. The number of research students with a connection to the general practice research field was fairly constant from 1997 to 2003. The number of permanently employed general practice advisers  on the other hand  has doubled  and these now undertake more of the advisory functions. The great majority of research students complete their projects  most of them at PhD level. Most of the research students surveyed indicated that they are prepared to take on advisory functions when they have acquired the competence to do so. The general practice research students vary greatly with regard to age  interests and career paths  but almost all complete their research studies. This may be due to the flexible framework for research in general practice and the increase in recent years of advisory capacity in general practice. This positive development is expected to continue through the development of networks  course activities and continuing follow-up of the advisory functions.
Family Practice,,,Parents' motivation for seeing a physician. To explore situations in which parents with an ill child consult a physician and to identify trigger factors for consultation. Qualitative interviews with parents of young children. Parents were asked to describe the situation in which the decision to contact the physician was made. A total of 20 families selected from a birth cohort from Frederiksborg County. The cohort numbered 194 of 389 children born between 1 and 28 February 2001. The cohort was followed prospectively from the age of 9 to 12 months by diary (January-April)  and retrospectively from birth to the age of 9 months by questionnaire. Families were chosen on the basis of information provided in a questionnaire  diary illness pattern and a telephone conversation. Nine trigger factors associated with physician contacts were identified. Parents' answers demonstrated how their feelings and logical reasoning while caring for an ill child led them to consult the physician. The main reasons for consultation were children's protracted or aggravated symptoms. Parents initially tried to handle the situation but when unsuccessful information and advice was sought by consulting a physician. Parents consult the physician when they feel overtaxed  afraid  or inadequately prepared to care for their ill child. They considered seriously whether to consult a physician or not.
Adolescent Psychiatry,,,The effect of daily small text message reminders for medicine compliance amongst young people connected with the outpatient department for child and adolescent psychiatry. A controlled and randomized investigation. Many patients with psychiatric illnesses have difficulty maintaining medication over time. Many take their medicine irregularly and studies show that it is the most vulnerable patients who have the greatest problems adhering to treatment. Often only 50% are still under medical treatment after 6 months. In this study we investigated whether text message reminders could improve medicine compliance amongst vulnerable young people with psychiatric disorders who were being treated in the outpatient department for child and adolescent psychiatry and who either are under or were to commence medicinal treatment. This study was conducted as a randomized controlled trial including all non-acute referrals to an outpatient department for adolescent psychiatry within a group aged 15-20 years starting medical treatment. The patients were followed until the end of their treatment  for a minimum of 3 months. To enhance medicine compliance  text messages were sent daily to one group. No message was sent to the other group. Compliance was not associated with text message intervention in any of the drug interventions. The effect size was calculated to 0.3013  which is low and therefore indicates a weak association between text message and compliance. The power in this study was calculated to 0.3539  which is also low and therefore the likelihood of finding significant association is low. This study does not show increased medicine compliance from the text message intervention group. The conclusion of this study is that it is essential that significant resources are spent preparing and testing a text message strategy.
Epidemiology,,,Risk factors and study designs used in research of youths' suicide behaviour-an epidemiological discussion with focus on level of evidence. Abstract Introduction: Many different epidemiology study designs have been used to analyse risk factors for suicide behaviour. The purpose of this study was to obtain an insight into the current study design used in research on youths' risk factors for suicide behaviour and to rank the studies according to level of evidence (LoE). We searched PubMed and psycINFO in order to identify relevant individual studies. We included 36 studies of children and youth on suicidal behaviour and ideation-many rank low on LoE. For suicide  cohort design was often used  and mental illness (depression  substance abuse and severity of mental illness) was the most common risk factor. Cohort studies are ranked 2b  which is high according to LoE. For suicide attempts  survey was often used  and psychopathology  substance abuse and being exposed to suicidal behaviour were the most common risk factors. For suicidal ideation  survey was the only design used  and substance abuse and psychopathology the most common risk factors. Surveys are ranked 4  which are low according to LoE. Many risk factors were broad and unspecific  and standard definitions of outcome and exposure were rarely used. A good study of risk factors for suicidal behaviour would need a high LoE  as a high-powered longitudinal epidemiological study (cohort or case-control) of very specific risk factors. The factors would have high prevention potential  compared with more broad and unspecific risk factors  to which many people are exposed. We would recommend a cohort design (in high-risk populations) or a case-control design to identify risk factors  using clinical and/or register data instead of self-reported information  reporting adjusted estimates and using standard definition of suicidal outcome and risk factors.
Psychiatry,,,Danish physicians' preferences for prescribing escitalopram over citalopram and sertraline to treatment-naïve patients: a national  register-based study. To investigate whether general practitioners  hospital physicians and specialized practitioners in psychiatry have similar preferences for initiating treatment with expensive serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). All first-time prescriptions for the SSRIs escitalopram  citalopram and sertraline reported to the Danish National Register of Medicinal Product Statistics from April 1  2009 until March 31  2010 were analysed with regard to treatment naivety and type of prescriber. A prescription was considered as first time if the patient had not received a prescription for the same drug within the last 2 years. Patients who had not received a prescription for an antidepressant within 6 months prior to the date of redemption were classified as treatment-naïve. We included 82 702 first-time prescriptions  65 313 (79 %) of which were for treatment-naïve patients. Of the treatment-naïve patients  19 % were initially prescribed escitalopram. Hospital physicians prescribed escitalopram to 34 % of their treatment-naïve patients  while practitioners specialized in psychiatry prescribed it to 25 %  and general practitioners prescribed it to 17 %. General practitioners  however  were responsible for initiating 87 % of all treatment-naïve patients. The most expensive SSRI  escitalopram  is prescribed as first choice to one in five patients receiving their first antidepressant of escitalopram  citalopram or sertraline. General practitioners made the bulk of all first-time SSRI prescriptions to treatment-naïve patients.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Fluid therapy for the surgical patient. Perioperative fluid therapy is the subject of much controversy  and the results of the clinical trials investigating the effect of fluid therapy on outcome of surgery seem contradictory. The aim of this chapter is to review the evidence behind current standard fluid therapy  and to critically analyse the trials examining the effect of fluid therapy on outcome of surgery. The following conclusions are reached: current standard fluid therapy is not at all evidence-based; the evaporative loss from the abdominal cavity is highly overestimated; the non-anatomical third space loss is based on flawed methodology and most probably does not exist; the fluid volume accumulated in traumatized tissue is very small; and volume preloading of neuroaxial blockade is not effective and may cause postoperative fluid overload. The trials of 'goal-directed fluid therapy' aiming at maximal stroke volume and the trials of 'restricted intravenous fluid therapy' are also critically evaluated. The difference in results may be caused by a lax attitude towards 'standard fluid therapy' in the trials of goal-directed fluid therapy  resulting in the testing of various 'standard fluid regimens' versus 'even more fluid'. Without evidence of the existence of a non-anatomical third space loss and ineffectiveness of preloading of neuroaxial blockade  'restricted intravenous fluid therapy' is not 'restricted'  but rather avoids fluid overload by replacing only the fluid actually lost during surgery. The trials of different fluid volumes administered during outpatient surgery confirm that replacement of fluid lost improves outcome. Based on current evidence  the principles of 'restricted intravenous fluid therapy' are recommended: fluid lost should be replaced and fluid overload should be avoided.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Hemorrhage and operation cause a contraction of the extracellular space needing replacement--evidence and implications? A systematic review. Hemorrhagic hypotension or operative trauma is believed to cause a contraction of the extracellular fluid volume (ECV) beyond the measured fluid losses. The aim of this review was to explore the evidence and implications of ECV loss. We performed a systematic review of original trials measuring ECV changes during hemorrhage or operation. PubMed  relevant periodicals  and reference lists were searched until no further original articles appeared. The quality of both the scientific and the technical methods of the trials were evaluated. A total of 61 original articles were found. The pattern appeared that all investigators reporting shock or operation to cause a disparate reduction of the ECV had measured the ECV with the same method. The ECV was calculated from very few blood samples that were withdrawn after 20 to 30 minutes of equilibration of a tracer (the (35)SO(4)-tracer). Trials calculating ECV from multiple blood samples  after longer equilibration times  or using other tracers did not find a contraction of the ECV. On the contrary  trials using a bromide tracer found the ECV to be expanded after operation. The evidence supporting the idea that hemorrhage or operation cause a contraction of the ECV is weak  and probably a result of flawed methodology.
General Practice,,,Do work-related factors affect care-seeking in general practice for back pain or upper extremity pain? Musculoskeletal pain conditions remain a major cause of care-seeking in general practice. Not all patients with musculoskeletal pain (MP) seek care at their general practitioner (GP)  but for those who do  the GP's knowledge of what work-related factors might have influenced the patient's decision to seek care could be important in order to give more well-founded advice to our patients. The objective of this study was to elucidate the effects of workloads on care-seeking for back pain or upper extremity pain during an eighteen-month follow-up period. This is a prospective study with a baseline questionnaire and eighteen-month follow-up. Among the registered patients of 8 GPs  we identified 8 517 persons between 17 and 65 years of age  who all received the questionnaire. A total of 5 068 (59.5 %) persons answered. During the eighteen months of follow-up  we used the International Classification for Primary Care (ICPC) to identify all care-seekers with either back pain or upper extremity pain. Of these  all currently employed persons were included in our analysis  in all 4 325 persons. For analysis  we used Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Analyses were stratified by gender. High levels of heavy lifting  defined as the upper tertile on a categorical scale  were associated with care-seeking for back pain (HR 1.90 [95 % CI: 1.14-3.15]) and upper extremity pain (HR 2.09 [95 % CI: 1.30-3.38]) among males  but not in a statistically significant way among females. Repetitive work and psychosocial factors did not have any statistically significant impact on care-seeking for neither back pain nor upper extremity pain. Work-related factors such as heavy lifting do  to some extent  contribute to care-seeking with MP. We suggest that asking the patient about physical workloads should be routinely included in consultations dealing with MP.
General Practice,,,Modern health worries and visits to the general practitioner in a general population sample: an 18month follow-up study. Modern health worries (MHW) are concerns about health risks from features of modern life (e.g. additives in food  contaminated water supply  drug resistant bacteria  etc.). We investigated the role of MHW for care seeking for all purposes at the general practitioner (GP) and studied the role of neuroticism  symptoms of anxiety and somatization  other health anxiety  self-rated health  age  education and gender on the association between MHW and care-seeking. A representative sample from eight GPs (n=5068) completed a baseline questionnaire on MHW  symptoms of health and personality  and was followed for visits to the GP for the next 18months in the registers from the GP. Modern health worries were common  and higher levels were seen among women and in higher age. Care seeking at the GP was associated with MHW  and this association was maintained after adjusting for age  gender  neurotic traits  symptoms of anxiety  somatization  other health anxieties and self-rated health. Over and beyond health related factors and personality  MHW had an independent role for future visits to the GP in the magnitude of 20% more visits among the participants in the highest quartile of the MHW-scale.
General Practice,,,The significance of health anxiety and somatization in care-seeking for back and upper extremity pain. Patients with musculoskeletal pain account for a large number of consultations in primary care. Improving our understanding of factors that make patients seek care could be of interest in decision making and prevention in the health care system. Our objectives were to examine if health anxiety  somatization and fear-avoidance beliefs were of importance for care-seeking with either back pain or upper extremity pain and to look at possible differences between the two groups. This is a prospective study with a baseline questionnaire and 18 months follow-up. Using the International Classification for Primary Care (ICPC)  we identified care-seekers with either back pain or upper extremity pain among the potential patients of eight GPs. For analysis  we used Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Analysis was stratified by gender. We found that previous regional pain was a strong predictor of care-seeking. Somatization was associated with seeking care for back pain. Health anxiety was a predictor among women suffering from back pain. Only previous pain was a predictor of care-seeking for upper extremity pain. The study implies that prevention of back pain and upper extremity pain requires different strategies and that gender and health anxieties should be taken into account.
Pathology  Clinical,,,Implementation of a new rapid tissue processing method--advantages and challenges. Conventional tissue processing of histologic specimens has been carried out in the same manner for many years. It is a time-consuming process involving batch production  resulting in a 1-day delay of the diagnosis. Microwave-assisted tissue processing enables a continuous high flow of histologic specimens through the processor with a processing time of as low as 1h. In this article  we present the effects of the automated microwave-assisted tissue processor on the histomorphologic quality and the turnaround time (TAT) for histopathology reports. We present a blind comparative study regarding the histomorphologic quality of microwave-processed and conventionally processed tissue samples. A total of 333 specimens were included. The microwave-assisted processing method showed a histomorphologic quality comparable to the conventional method for a number of tissue types  including skin and specimens from the gastrointestinal  urogenital  and female genital tract. We studied the TAT for all histologic specimens received in a period of six consecutive weeks in 2006 and 2007  respectively. We found a positive impact on TATs after introducing microwave-assisted processing in the laboratory. Turnaround times  in general  were improved  and same-day-reporting  in particular  showed an increase from 0% to 15%.
Family Practice,,,[Diagnosis coding of the musculoskeletal system in general practice]. Danish general practitioners are encouraged to code diagnoses according to the Danish version of ICPC. In order to evaluate feasibility  we aimed to estimate sensitivity of ICPC coding of patients with symptoms from the musculoskeletal system (ICPC L01-20 and 83-99) in general practice compared to health information from other sources. We identified patients connected to one general practice in July 2005. We retrieved information on referred care by specialists in neurology  rheumatology  and orthopaedic surgery as well as treatments by physiotherapists from the Danish Health Insurance. We received ICD10 codes within chapter 8 (diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue) from the Danish Hospital Register. Sensitivity was calculated according to criteria based on whether the patients had received an ICD10 code or other public health services. Of 2649 patients registered in the general practice  496 had recorded an ICPC code in chapter L (the musculoskeletal system). Sensitivity was calculated to 0.83. Of all patients with musculoskeletal diseases 82.5% were identified by ICPC codes  but only 45% by other health sources. The coding of ICPC in a general practice had an acceptable sensitivity and constitutes a useful opportunity to identify a group of patients with musculoskeletal diseases. An optimal identification of specific patient subgroups  by using ICPC coding  requires the construction of a national registry of the ICPC coding made in all Danish general practices.
Epidemiology,,,Trends in risk of recurrence after the first ischemic stroke in adults younger than 55 years of age in Sweden. Previous studies on stroke recurrence in younger adults often contain small sample size which makes it difficult to study trends in stroke recurrence over a long period of time. The aim of the present study was to investigate temporal trends in the risk of recurrence in younger patients with a first ischemic stroke. All men and women aged 18-54 years who had survived at least 28 days after a first ischemic stroke from 1987 to 2006 were identified in the Swedish Inpatient Register. The patients were stratified into four 5-year periods according to their admission period and were followed up for a total of four years after the index event with regard to recurrent ischemic stroke. A Cox regression model was used to analyze the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke. Of the 17 149 ischemic stroke patients who were identified  2432 (14.2%) had a recurrent ischemic stroke event within four years. From the first to the last periods (1987-1991 versus 2002-2006)  the four-year risk of recurrent ischemic stroke decreased by 55% (hazard ratio 0.45  95% confidence interval 0.39-0.53) in men and 59% (hazard ratio 0.41  95% confidence interval  0.33-0.50) in women. The cumulative four-year risk was 11.8% (95% CI 10.55-13.25) in men and 9.8% (95% CI 8.40-11.46) in women during the last five-year period (2002-2006). The risk of recurrence among younger ischemic stroke patients has decreased over the past 20 years. Despite these improvements  younger patients are still at a high risk for recurrent ischemic stroke.
Emergency Medicine,,,The Emergency Medicine Events Register: An analysis of the first 150 incidents entered into a novel  online incident reporting registry. Incident reporting systems are critical to understanding adverse events  in order to create preventative and corrective strategies. There are very few systems dedicated to Emergency Medicine with published results. All EDs in Australia and New Zealand were contacted to encourage the use of an Emergency Medicine - specific online reporting system called the Emergency Medicine Events Register (EMER). We conducted an analysis of the first 150 incidents entered into EMER. EMER captures Emergency-medicine-specific details including triage score  clinical presentation  outcome  contributing factors  mitigating factors  other specialities involved and patient journey stage. These details were analysed by an expert panel. Over the first 26 months  150 incidents were reported into EMER. The most common categories reported  in order  were diagnostic error  procedural complication and investigation errors. Most incidents contained more than one category of error. The most common stage of the patient's journey in which an incident was detected was after discharge from the ED. A focus on correct diagnosis  procedure performance and investigation interpretation may reduce errors in the ED. The ability to learn from incidents and make system changes to enhance patient safety in healthcare organisations is an inherent part of providing a proactive  quality culture.
Cardiology,,,Reperfusion therapy for ST elevation acute myocardial infarction 2010/2011: current status in 37 ESC countries. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) is the preferred reperfusion therapy in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). We conducted this study to evaluate the contemporary status on the use and type of reperfusion therapy in patients admitted with STEMI in the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) member countries. A cross-sectional descriptive study based on aggregated country-level data on the use of reperfusion therapy in patients admitted with STEMI during 2010 or 2011. Thirty-seven ESC countries were able to provide data from existing national or regional registries. In countries where no such registries exist  data were based on best expert estimates. Data were collected on the use of STEMI reperfusion treatment and mortality  the numbers of cardiologists  and the availability of PPCI facilities in each country. Our survey provides a brief data summary of the degree of variation in reperfusion therapy across Europe. The number of PPCI procedures varied between countries  ranging from 23 to 884 per million inhabitants. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention and thrombolysis were the dominant reperfusion strategy in 33 and 4 countries  respectively. The mean population served by a single PPCI centre with a 24-h service 7 days a week ranged from 31 300 inhabitants per centre to 6 533 000 inhabitants per centre. Twenty-seven of the total 37 countries participated in a former survey from 2007  and major increases in PPCI utilization were observed in 13 of these countries. Large variations in reperfusion treatment are still present across Europe. Countries in Eastern and Southern Europe reported that a substantial number of STEMI patients are not receiving any reperfusion therapy. Implementation of the best reperfusion therapy as recommended in the guidelines should be encouraged.
Genetics  Medical,,,Simulation based virtual learning environment in medical genetics counseling: an example of bridging the gap between theory and practice in medical education. Simulation based learning environments are designed to improve the quality of medical education by allowing students to interact with patients  diagnostic laboratory procedures  and patient data in a virtual environment. However  few studies have evaluated whether simulation based learning environments increase students' knowledge  intrinsic motivation  and self-efficacy  and help them generalize from laboratory analyses to clinical practice and health decision-making. An entire class of 300 University of Copenhagen first-year undergraduate students  most with a major in medicine  received a 2-h training session in a simulation based learning environment. The main outcomes were pre- to post- changes in knowledge  intrinsic motivation  and self-efficacy  together with post-intervention evaluation of the effect of the simulation on student understanding of everyday clinical practice were demonstrated. Knowledge (Cohen's d = 0.73)  intrinsic motivation (d = 0.24)  and self-efficacy (d = 0.46) significantly increased from the pre- to post-test. Low knowledge students showed the greatest increases in knowledge (d = 3.35) and self-efficacy (d = 0.61)  but a non-significant increase in intrinsic motivation (d = 0.22). The medium and high knowledge students showed significant increases in knowledge (d = 1.45 and 0.36  respectively)  motivation (d = 0.22 and 0.31)  and self-efficacy (d = 0.36 and 0.52  respectively). Additionally  90 % of students reported a greater understanding of medical genetics  82 % thought that medical genetics was more interesting  93 % indicated that they were more interested and motivated  and had gained confidence by having experienced working on a case story that resembled the real working situation of a doctor  and 78 % indicated that they would feel more confident counseling a patient after the simulation. The simulation based learning environment increased students' learning  intrinsic motivation  and self-efficacy (although the strength of these effects differed depending on their pre-test knowledge)  and increased the perceived relevance of medical educational activities. The results suggest that simulations can help future generations of doctors transfer new understanding of disease mechanisms gained in virtual laboratory settings into everyday clinical practice.
Naval Medicine,,,The influence of ship movements on the energy expenditure of fishermen. A study during a North Sea voyage in calm weather. Former studies of professional fishing activities have indicated that movements of a ship  in itself  may increase the energy expenditure in addition to the traditional work carried out by fishermen. We have studied the effects of exposure to the ships movement during calm weather by examining the crude relation between the ship movement and the energy expenditure of the fishermen  thus ignoringthe various tasks undertaken on board. We have recruited 4 fishermen on 2 contemporary steel trawlers who participatedduring the whole study period. Each of 4 participants recorded his activities and health conditions oncean hour in a registration scheme for 4 days. Estimations of energy expenditure were done with a bodymonitoring system (SenseWear Pro 3) carried as an armband  placed at the surface on the right upper arm. Measurements of sea movements were obtained by a gyroscope placed in the vessels wheelhouse during fishing expeditions in the North Sea off the coast of Bergen. Data were analysed by linear regression. The exposure monitored in calm weather conditions was small for all measurements of heelingand pitch being less than 10o for both vessels. However  the fishermen's energy expenditure was influenced by these minor sea motions. Trends were seen in the individual graphs with increasing energy expenditureat higher exposures. Our data suggest that even the heel and pitch in calm weather have an impact on the fishermen by increasing their energy consumption  but without any observation of discomfort or negative health outcomes. This study has demonstrated the feasibility of the applied methods  which should be repeated with larger samples and in rough weather.
Epidemiology,,,Associations of anthropometry and lifestyle factors with HDL subspecies according to apolipoprotein C-III. The presence of apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) on high-density lipoproteins (HDL) impairs HDL's inverse association with coronary heart disease. Little is known about modifiable factors explaining variation in HDL subspecies defined according to apoC-III. Aim was to investigate cross-sectional associations of anthropometry and lifestyle with HDL subspecies in 3631 participants from the Diet Cancer and Health study originally selected for a case-cohort study (36% women; age 50-65 y) who were all free of CHD. Greater adiposity and less activity were associated with higher HDL containing apoC-III and lower HDL lacking apoC-III. Per each 15 cm higher waist circumference  the level of HDL containing apoC-III was 2.8% higher (95%CI: 0.4  5.3 %;p=0.024) and the level of HDL not containing apoC-III was 4.7% lower (95% CI: -6.0  -3.4 %;p=<0.0001). Associations for physical activity were most robust to multivariable modeling. Each 20 metabolic equivalent hour/week reported higher physical activity was associated with 0.9% (95%CI: -1.7  -0.1 %;p=0.031) lower HDL containing apoC-III and 0.5% higher (95%CI: 0.1  1.0 %;p=0.029) HDL lacking apoC-III. Lower alcohol consumption was associated with lower HDL lacking apoC-III (% difference per 15 g/day: 1.58 (95%CI: 0.84  2.32;p=<0.0001). Adiposity and sedentary lifestyle were associated with a less favorable HDL subspecies profile.
Anesthesiology,,,Implications of Thoracic Epidural Analgesia on Hospital Charges in Rib Fracture Patients.  Rib fractures are present in more than 150 000 patients admitted to US trauma centers each year. Those who fracture two or more ribs are typically treated with oral analgesic drugs and are discharged with few complications. The cost of this care generally reflects its brevity. When a patient fractures three or more ribs  there is an elevated risk of complication. In response  treatments are often broadened and their durations prolonged; this affects cost. While health  function  and survival have been widely explored  patient billing has not. Thus  we evaluated the financial implications of one mode of treatment for patients with rib fractures: thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA). We retrospectively analyzed the registry of a level II trauma center. All patients who fractured one or more ribs (n = 1 344) were considered; 382 of those patients were not candidates for epidural placement and were eliminated from analyses. Epidural placement was determined by individual clinicians. We used multiple linear regressions to determine predictors of cost. After eliminating patients who were not eligible to receive TEA  the average patient bill was $59 123 ($10 631 per day of treatment). The administration of TEA predicted a 25% reduction in total billing (99% CI = -$21 429.55- -$7 794.66) and a 24% reduction in per-day billing (99% CI = -$3 745.99- -$1 276.14). Patients who received TEA were more severely injured and required longer treatments; controlling for these variables  the use of TEA associated with reductions in the cost of receiving care. From an administrative and insurance perspective  more frequent reliance on TEA may be indicated.
Anesthesiology,Telemedicine,,[Ambulance transportation guidelines]. Inter-hospital transportation poses potential risks to staff and patients. The present guidelines recommend competency-based management dictated by the patient's clinical condition and medical requirements during transfer. The guidelines aim to: 1) improve patient and staff safety during transport  2) minimize the occurrence of adverse events during transport  3) ensure that accompanying staff are trained for and skilled in transfer and retrieval medicine and 4) encourage optimal utilisation of available competencies without unnecessarily draining hospital resources.
Telemedicine,,,[Prehospital trauma triage before and after deployment of a physician-manned mobile emergency care unit in Nordsjaelland]. Prompt and correct triage to a facility capable of providing optimal care is important for survival and functional outcome after major trauma. This study compared the influence of on-scene deployment of physicians with medical telephone counselling of paramedics on the triage of trauma patients. A retrospective study of trauma patients triaged to tertiary treatment outside Frederiksborg County from March 2006 to February 2007. Patients were either triaged directly from the scene of the accident or secondarily transferred from a local hospital. The study period was divided into two intervals. Triage in the first interval was based on telephone counselling of paramedics by consultant anaesthesiologists. Triage in the second interval was performed by the same anaesthesiologists deployed in the field. Triage decisions  Injury Severity Score (ISS) and 30-day mortality were registered. Among 607 patients  82 were triaged to tertiary treatment. The proportion of patients triaged directly from the scene of the accident increased from 27.8% to 69.6% after prehospital deployment of physicians  whereas secondary transfers decreased from 72.2% to 30.4% (p = 0.0002). Patients triaged directly from the scene had a significantly lower ISS than secondarily transferred patients (5 (1-17) versus 17 (14-26)  p < 0.0001). Prehospital  physician-based triage of trauma significantly reduced the need for secondary transfers to tertiary facilities.
Epidemiology,,,Mortality in individuals with disruptive behavior disorders diagnosed by specialist services - A nationwide cohort study. Disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs)  inclusive of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD)  are associated with outcomes likely to increase risk of mortality. Using Danish National Registers  a total of 1.92 million individuals including 9495 individuals with DBDs diagnosed by specialist services were followed from their first birthday to 2013. Those with and without DBDs were compared using mortality rate ratios (MRRs) estimated using Poisson regression and adjusted for calendar period  age  sex  family history of psychiatric disorders  maternal age at time of birth  paternal age at time of birth  parental education status  and parental employment status. Over the course of follow up  which totalled 24.9 million person-years  5580 cohort members died including 78 individuals with DBDs. The mortality rate per 10 000 person-years was 9.66 for individuals with DBDs compared to 2.22 for those with no diagnosis. This corresponded to a fully adjusted MRR of 2.57 (95% confidence interval 2.04-3.20). Comorbid substance use disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder resulted in the highest MRR across all categories. These findings demonstrate the excess mortality associated with DBDs.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Preventive out-patient treatment of affective disorders]. The present article is based on a Health Technology Assessment Report (HTA  available with an English summary at www.cemtv.dk) on preventive out-patient treatment of affective disorders. The article briefly reviews the course of depressive disorder and bipolar affective disorder and reviews the best available treatment modalities including shared care models  prophylactic pharmacotherapy and prophylactic combination therapy involving pharmacotherapy and psychological treatment.
Pediatrics,,,Heart rate in pediatric trauma: rethink your strategy. The optimal heart rate (HR) for children after trauma is based on values derived at rest for a given age. As the stages of shock are based in part on HR  a better understanding of how HR varies after trauma is necessary. Admission HRs of pediatric trauma patients were analyzed to determine which ranges were associated with lowest mortality. The National Trauma Data Bank was used to evaluate all injured patients ages 1-14 years admitted between 2007 and 2011. Patients were stratified into eight groups based on age. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were recorded  and regression analysis was used to determine mortality odds ratios (ORs) for HR ranges within each age group. A total of 214 254 pediatric trauma patients met inclusion criteria. The average admission HR and systolic blood pressure were 104.7 and 120.4  respectively. Overall mortality was 0.8%. The HR range associated with lowest mortality varied across age groups and  in children ages 7-14  was narrower than accepted resting HR ranges. The lowest risk of mortality for patients ages 5-14 was captured at HR 80-99. The HR associated with lowest mortality after pediatric trauma frequently differs from resting HR. Our data suggest that a 7y old with an HR of 115 bpm may be in stage III shock  whereas traditional HR ranges suggest that this is a normal rate for this child. Knowing when HR is critically high or low in the pediatric trauma population will better guide treatment.
Evidence-Based Practice,,,The value of gynecologic cancer follow-up: evidence-based ignorance? To explore the extent of evidence-based data and cost-utility of follow-up after primary treatment of endometrial and ovarian cancer  addressing perspectives of technology  organization  economics  and patients. Systematic literature searches according to the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions were conducted separately for each of the 4 perspectives. In addition  the organizational analysis included a nationwide questionnaire survey among all relevant hospital departments  and the operating costs were calculated. None of the identified studies supported a survival benefit from hospital-based follow-up after completion of primary treatment of endometrial or ovarian cancer. The methods for follow-up were of low technology (gynecologic examination with or without ultrasound examination). Other technologies had poor sensitivity and specificity in detecting recurrence. Small changes in applied technologies and organization lead to substantial changes in costs. Substantial differences especially in frequency and applied methods were found between departments. The literature review did not find evidence that follow-up affects the women's quality of life. The main purpose of follow-up after treatment of cancer is improved survival. Our review of the literature showed no evidence of a positive effect on survival in women followed up after primary treatment of endometrial or ovarian cancer. The conception of follow-up among physicians  patients  and their relatives therefore needs revision. Follow-up after treatment should have a clearly defined and evidence-based purpose. Based on the existing literature  this purpose should presently focus on other end points rather than early detection of relapse and improved survival. These end points could be quality of life  treatment toxicity  and economy.
Molecular Epidemiology,,,A narrow deletion of 7q is common to HCL  and SMZL  but not CLL. To further characterise the genetic background of the two closely related B-lymphocytic malignancies hairy cell leukaemia (HCL)  and splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) we have identified characteristic copy number imbalances by comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH). Based on these findings  areas of special interest were fine mapped  and relevant probes constructed for use in interphase-fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) investigations. Thus  using the CGH data from 52 HCL and 61 SMZL patients  we identified the characteristic profiles of copy number imbalances for both diseases. These were a gain of 5q13-31 (19%) and loss of 7q22-q35 (6%) for HCL  and gain of 3q25 (28%)  loss of 7q31 (16%)  and gain of 12q15 (16%) for SMZL. A partial loss of 7q unusual for low-malignant B-cell diseases was found to be common to the two diseases. This loss was therefore fine mapped with BAC/PAC clones. Fine mapping revealed that in SMZL the minimal lost region covers 11.4 Mb spanning from 7q31.33 to 7q33 located between sequence tagged site (STS)-markers SHGC-3275 and D7S725. This area was distinct from the commonly deleted 7q region of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia (MDS/AML). A FISH probe specific for the 7q region was constructed. Using this probe in an interphase-FISH investigation we showed the minimal lost 7q-region of HCL and SMZL to be one and the same. In one HCL case  this investigation furthermore showed the extent of the deleted region to be below the detection limit of CGH  whereas interphase-FISH screening of 36 chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cases showed no deletion of the 7q area. In conclusion  we have identified characteristic profiles of copy number imbalances in HCL and SMZL and fine mapped the minimal extent of a commonly lost 7q area of special interest. We hypothesise that this region may contain (a) gene(s) important for the pathology of HCL and SMZL.
Global Health,,,Network-Based Integration of GWAS and Gene Expression Identifies a HOX-Centric Network Associated with Serous Ovarian Cancer Risk. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have so far reported 12 loci associated with serous epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) risk. We hypothesized that some of these loci function through nearby transcription factor (TF) genes and that putative target genes of these TFs as identified by coexpression may also be enriched for additional EOC risk associations. We selected TF genes within 1 Mb of the top signal at the 12 genome-wide significant risk loci. Mutual information  a form of correlation  was used to build networks of genes strongly coexpressed with each selected TF gene in the unified microarray dataset of 489 serous EOC tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Genes represented in this dataset were subsequently ranked using a gene-level test based on results for germline SNPs from a serous EOC GWAS meta-analysis (2 196 cases/4 396 controls). Gene set enrichment analysis identified six networks centered on TF genes (HOXB2  HOXB5  HOXB6  HOXB7 at 17q21.32 and HOXD1  HOXD3 at 2q31) that were significantly enriched for genes from the risk-associated end of the ranked list (P < 0.05 and FDR < 0.05). These results were replicated (P < 0.05) using an independent association study (7 035 cases/21 693 controls). Genes underlying enrichment in the six networks were pooled into a combined network. We identified a HOX-centric network associated with serous EOC risk containing several genes with known or emerging roles in serous EOC development. Network analysis integrating large  context-specific datasets has the potential to offer mechanistic insights into cancer susceptibility and prioritize genes for experimental characterization.
General Practice,,,Multimorbidity and blood pressure control in 37 651 hypertensive patients from Danish general practice. Patients with hypertension are primarily treated in general practice. However  major studies of patients with hypertension are rarely based on populations from primary care. Knowledge of blood pressure (BP) control rates in patients with diabetes and/or cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)  who have additional comorbidities  is lacking. We aimed to investigate the association of comorbidities with BP control using a large cohort of hypertensive patients from primary care practices. Using the Danish General Practice Database  we included 37 651 patients with hypertension from 231 general practices in Denmark. Recommended BP control was defined as BP <140/90 mm Hg in general and <130/80 mm Hg in patients with diabetes. The overall control rate was 33.2% (95% CI: 32.7 to 33.7). Only 16.5% (95% CI: 15.8 to 17.3) of patients with diabetes achieved BP control  whereas control rates ranged from 42.9% to 51.4% for patients with ischemic heart diseases or cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular diseases. A diagnosis of cardiac heart failure in addition to diabetes and/or CVD was associated with higher BP control rates  compared with men and women having only diabetes and/or CVD. A diagnosis of asthma in addition to diabetes and CVD was associated with higher BP control rates in men. In Danish general practice  only 1 of 3 patients diagnosed with hypertension had a BP below target. BP control rates differ substantially within comorbidities. Other serious comorbidities in addition to diabetes and/or CVD were not associated with lower BP control rates; on the contrary  in some cases the BP control rates were higher when the patient was diagnosed with other serious comorbidities in addition to diabetes and/or CVD.
Family Practice,,,[Data collection perspectives from patient care in general practice]. GPs in Denmark have a unique civil registration system with personal ID-numbers  a patient list system and a gatekeeper function. A piece of software (Data Capture) has been developed to automatically collect and send prescriptions  lab tests  expense items and diagnosis information from the physician's patient files to the Danish General Practice Database (DAMD). Furthermore  project-related information can be captured by a pop up screen. Data about the GPs' own quality in the field of patient care are sent back to the GP. Many research projects are currently being initiated on the basis of DAMD data.
Family Practice,,,Estimating incidence and prevalence of episodes of care in general practice. To develop methods for prospective registration and analysis of episodes of care (one or more contacts about the same health problem). To compare estimates of point prevalence and incidence of hypertension among a group of elderly patients by means of an elaborate coding of episodes and a new method based on routine coding of contact diagnoses. Prospective longitudinal cohort study. General practice in Denmark. 31 GPs and 1722 patients 70+ years of age. During the course one year  data were registered in the doctors' electronic medical record systems. Registration included ICPC diagnoses and codes for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Individual contacts were linked into episodes of care by the recording physician. Prevalence and incidence were calculated from the GPs' registration of episodes of care and from contact registration by means of a new method  "the waiting time distribution". Estimates of incidence (2.1 per 100 patient years) and point prevalence (21.2 per 100 patients) of episodes of hypertension care could be calculated when the GPs actively linked contacts into episodes. Based on simple contact registration it was possible to calculate similar estimates. A full registration of episodes of care is time-consuming and complicated. Incidence and point prevalence of chronic conditions  however  may be estimated from simple coding of contact diagnoses.
Clinical Nursing Research,Evidence-Based Nursing,Geriatric Nursing,Chronic disease management: implementation and coordination of healthcare systems for depressed elderly persons. The aim of this study was to evaluate the implementation of the research-based Chronic Care Model (CCM)  discuss methods and summarise research recommendations for improving the care of depressed elderly persons. Interviews were conducted and state-of-the-art reviews employed. Three important areas emerged: (1) barriers to and facilitating factors in the implementation of the CCM; (2) the challenges involved in re-designing the delivery system and interdisciplinary team collaboration; and (3) empirical evidence pertaining to self-management support and how older persons manage to live with depressive ill-health. In conclusion  implementation research requires evidence-based knowledge  staff involvement and familiarity with the context in which development occurs.
Community Health Nursing,Geriatric Nursing,Nursing Methodology Research,Effective nursing leadership of older persons in the community - a systematic review. The aim of this systematic review was to increase the knowledge of developing effective nursing leadership and management in order to improve the outcomes of older persons in the community. There is a need for increased knowledge of nursing leadership and management in order to improve the outcomes of older persons in the community. A review of the literature published in different databases between January 2000 and May 2012 was conducted. Eleven articles met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated by means of thematic content analysis. Six themes were identified: Ability to change the attitudes towards older persons; Building trust; Ensuring efficacy in management decisions; Lack of knowledge about how to overcome relational challenges; Health system collaboration to achieve goals and visions; and Staff members' experiences of the meaning of and possibility to influence their work  all of which are of importance for effective nursing leadership and management in the care of older persons. Advanced nursing knowledge is necessary in order to improve the work and vision involved in nursing leadership and management. Findings indicate that relational and organisational abilities are necessary components of effective nursing leadership and management.
Epidemiology,,,Incidence and survival outcome according to heart rhythm during resuscitation attempt in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients with presumed cardiac etiology. Knowledge about heart rhythm conversion from non-shockable to shockable rhythm during resuscitation attempt after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and following chance of survival is limited and inconsistent. We studied 13 860 patients with presumed cardiac-caused OHCA not witnessed by the emergency medical services from the Danish Cardiac Arrest Register (2005-2012). Patients were stratified according to rhythm: shockable  converted shockable (based on receipt of subsequent defibrillation) and sustained non-shockable rhythm. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify predictors of rhythm conversion and to compute 30-day survival chances. Twenty-five percent of patients who received pre-hospital defibrillation by ambulance personnel were initially found in non-shockable rhythms. Younger age  males  witnessed arrest  shorter response time  and heart disease were significantly associated with conversion to shockable rhythm  while psychiatric- and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were significantly associated with sustained non-shockable rhythm. Compared to sustained non-shockable rhythms  converted shockable rhythms and initial shockable rhythms were significantly associated with increased 30-day survival (Adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.6  95% confidence interval (CI): 1.8-3.8; and OR 16.4  95% CI 12.7-21.2  respectively). From 2005 to 2012  30-day survival chances increased significantly for all three groups: shockable rhythms  from 16.3% (CI: 14.2%-18.7%) to 35.7% (CI: 32.5%-38.9%); converted rhythms  from 2.1% (CI: 1.6%-2.9%) to 5.8% (CI: 4.4%-7.6%); and sustained non-shockable rhythms  from 0.6% (CI: 0.5%-0.8%) to 1.8% (CI: 1.4%-2.2%). Converting to shockable rhythm during resuscitation attempt was common and associated with nearly a three-fold higher odds of 30-day survival compared to sustained non-shockable rhythms.
Pharmacoepidemiology,,,Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use is associated with increased risk of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a nationwide case-time-control study. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used and have been associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Nonetheless  it remains unknown whether use of NSAIDs is associated with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). From the nationwide Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry  all persons with OHCA during 2001-10 were identified. NSAID use 30 days before OHCA was categorized as follows: diclofenac  naproxen  ibuprofen  rofecoxib  celecoxib  and other. Risk of OHCA associated with use of NSAIDs was analysed by conditional logistic regression in case-time-control models matching four controls on sex and age per case to account for variation in drug utilization over time. We identified 28 947 persons with OHCA of whom 3376 were treated with an NSAID up to 30 days before OHCA. Ibuprofen and diclofenac were the most commonly used NSAIDs and represented 51.0% and 21.8% of total NSAID use  respectively. Use of diclofenac (odds ratio [OR]  1.50 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23-1.82]) and ibuprofen [OR  1.31 (95% CI 1.14-1.51)] was associated with a significantly increased risk of OHCA. Use of naproxen [OR  1.29 (95% CI 0.77-2.16)]  celecoxib [OR  1.13 (95% CI 0.74-1.70)]  and rofecoxib (OR  1.28 [95% CI 0.74-1.70)] was not significantly associated with increased risk of OHCA; however  these groups were characterized by few events. Use of non-selective NSAIDs was associated with an increased early risk of OHCA. The result was driven by an increased risk of OHCA in ibuprofen and diclofenac users.
Emergency Medicine,,,Effect of ultrasound training of physicians working in the prehospital setting. Advances in technology have made ultrasound (US) devices smaller and portable  hence accessible for prehospital care providers. This study aims to evaluate the effect of a four-hour  hands-on US training course for physicians working in the prehospital setting. The primary outcome measure was US performance assessed by the total score in a modified version of the Objective Structured Assessment of Ultrasound Skills scale (mOSAUS). Prehospital physicians participated in a four-hour US course consisting of both hands-on training and e-learning including a pre- and a post-learning test. Prior to the hands-on training a pre-training test was applied comprising of five videos in which the participants should identify pathology and a five-minute US examination of a healthy volunteer portraying to be a shocked patient after a blunt torso trauma. Following the pre-training test  the participants received a four-hour  hands-on US training course which was concluded with a post-training test. The US examinations and screen output from the US equipment were recorded for subsequent assessment. Two blinded raters assessed the videos using the mOSAUS. Forty participants completed the study. A significant improvement was identified in e-learning performance and US performance  (37.5 (SD: 10.0)) vs. (51.3 (SD: 5.9) p = < 0.0001)  total US performance score (15.3 (IQR: 12.0-17.5) vs. 17.5 (IQR: 14.5-21.0)  p = < 0.0001) and in each of the five assessment elements of the mOSAUS. In the prehospital physicians assessed  we found significant improvements in the ability to perform US examinations after completing a four-hour  hands-on US training course.
Epidemiology,,,Prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation and outcomes after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. It is unclear whether prolonged resuscitation can result in successful outcome following out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA). We assessed associations between duration of pre-hospital resuscitation on survival and functional outcome following OHCA in patients achieving pre-hospital return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). We included 1316 adult OHCA individuals with pre-hospital ROSC (2005-2011) handled by the largest nationwide ambulance provider in Denmark. Patients were stratified into 0-5  6-10  11-15  16-20  21-25 and >25min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by emergency medical services until ROSC was achieved. Nursing home admission and diagnosis of anoxic brain damage were measured as proxies of poor neurological/functional outcomes. Median time from CPR initiation to ROSC was 12min (IQR: 7-18) while 20.4% achieved ROSC after >25min. Overall  37.5% (494) of the study population achieved 30-day survival. Thirty-day survival was inversely related to minutes of CPR to ROSC: ranging from 59.6% (127/213) for ≤5min to 13.8% (19/138) for >25min. If bystander initiated CPR before ambulance arrival  corresponding values ranged from 70.4% (107/152) to 21.8% (12/55). Of 30-day survivors  patients discharged to own home rather than nursing home ranged from 95.0% (124/127) to 84.7% (18/19)  respectively. Of 30-day survivors  patients discharged without diagnosis of anoxic brain damage ranged from 98.4% (125/127) to 73.7% (14/19) for corresponding intervals. Even those requiring prolonged resuscitation duration prior to ROSC had meaningful survival rates with the majority of survivors able to return to live in own homes. These data suggest that prolonged resuscitation is not futile.
Epidemiology,,,Genetic variation in WRN and ischemic stroke: General population studies and meta-analyses. Werner syndrome  a premature genetic aging syndrome  shares many clinical features reminiscent of normal physiological aging  and ischemic vascular disease is a frequent cause of death. We tested the hypothesis that genetic variation in the WRN gene was associated with risk of ischemic vascular disease in the general population. We included 58 284 participants from two general population cohorts  the Copenhagen City Heart Study (CCHS) and the Copenhagen General Population Study (CGPS). Of these  6 312 developed ischemic vascular disease during follow-up. In the CCHS (n=10 250)  we genotyped all non-synonymous variants in WRN with reported minor allele frequencies ≥0.5% in Caucasians. Second  variants which were associated with ischemic vascular disease in the CCHS or in previous studies  were genotyped in the CGPS (n=48 034). A total of 11 non-synonymous variants were identified in the CCHS. In C1367R (rs1346044) TT homozygotes versus CC/CT  hazard ratios for ischemic stroke were 1.09 (95% confidence interval: 0.95-1.24; P=0.22) in the CCHS  1.16 (1.00-1.33; P=0.04) in the CGPS  and 1.12 (1.01-1.23; P=0.02) in studies combined (CCHS+CGPS)  with similar trends for ischemic cerebrovascular disease (P=0.06). In meta-analyses including 59 190 individuals in 5 studies  the hazard ratio for ischemic stroke for C1367R TT homozygotes versus CC/CT was 1.14 (1.04-1.25; P=0.008). This study suggests that common genetic variation in WRN is associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke in the general population.
Epidemiology,,,High body mass index and cancer risk-a Mendelian randomisation study. High body mass index (BMI) has been associated with increased risk of some cancer. Whether these reflect causal associations is unknown. We examined this issue. Using a Mendelian randomisation approach  we studied 108 812 individuals from the general population. During a median of 4.7 years of follow-up (range 0-37)  8002 developed non-skin cancer  3347 non-melanoma skin cancer  1396 lung cancer  637 other smoking related cancers  1203 colon cancer  159 kidney cancer  1402 breast cancer  1062 prostate cancer  and 2804 other cancers. Participants were genotyped for five genetic variants associated with BMI. Two Danish general population studies  the Copenhagen General Population and the Copenhagen City Heart Study. In observational analyses  overall risk of non-melanoma skin cancer was 35 % (95 % confidence interval 28-42 %) lower and risk of lung cancer 32 % (19-43 %) lower in individuals with a BMI ≥ 30 versus 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2). Corresponding risk of breast cancer was 20 % (0-44 %) higher in postmenopausal women. BMI was not associated with risk of colon  kidney  other smoking related cancers  prostate cancer  or other cancers. In genetic analyses  carrying 7-10 versus 0-4 BMI increasing alleles was associated with a 3 % higher BMI (P < 0.001)  but not with risk of cancer. In instrumental variable analysis for a 10 kg/m(2) higher genetically determined BMI the odds ratio for any non-skin cancer was 1.16 (0.64-2.09)  with a corresponding observational estimate of 0.94 (0.88-1.01). Using 108 812 individuals from the general population  we found that observationally high BMI was associated with lower risk of lung and skin cancer overall and with higher risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women  but not with other types of cancer. BMI increasing alleles were not associated with risk of cancer  and results do not support causal associations. Power to test associations for some cancer sites was low.
Genetics  Medical,,,Using human genetics to predict the effects and side-effects of drugs. 'Genetic proxies' are increasingly being used to predict the effects of drugs. We present an up-to-date overview of the use of human genetics to predict effects and adverse effects of lipid-targeting drugs. LDL cholesterol lowering variants in HMG-Coenzyme A reductase and Niemann-Pick C1-like protein 1  the targets for statins and ezetimibe  protect against ischemic heart disease (IHD). However  HMG-Coenzyme A reductase and Niemann-Pick C1-Like Protein 1-variants also increase the risk of type 2 diabetes and gallstone disease  respectively. Mutations in proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9)  apolipoprotein B  and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein cause low LDL cholesterol and protect against IHD. In addition  mutations in apolipoprotein B and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein cause hepatic steatosis  in concordance with drugs that inhibit these targets. Both mutations in PCSK9 and PCSK9-inhibition seem without adverse effects. Mutations in APOC3 cause low triglycerides and protect against IHD  and recent pharmacological APOC3-inhibition reported major reductions in plasma triglycerides. Human genetics support that low lipoprotein(a) protects against IHD  without adverse effects  and the first trial of lipoprotein(a) inhibition reduced lipoprotein(a) up to 78%. Recent genetic studies have confirmed the efficacy of statins and ezetimibe in protecting against IHD. Results from human genetics support that several lipid-lowering drugs currently under development are likely to prove efficacious in protecting against IHD  without major adverse effects.
Epidemiology,,,Health Anxiety in Preadolescence--Associated Health Problems  Healthcare Expenditure  and Continuity in Childhood. Epidemiological data on the distribution  persistence  and clinical correlates of health anxiety (HA) in childhood are scarce. We investigated continuity of HA symptoms and associated health problems and medical costs in primary health services in a general population birth cohort. HA symptoms were assessed in 1886 Danish 11-12 year old children (48 % boys) from the Copenhagen Child Cohort using the Childhood Illness Attitude Scales (CIAS) together with information on socio-demographics and the child's somatic and mental status and healthcare expenditure. Non-parametric statistics and regression analysis were used to compare groups with low (n = 184)  intermediate (n = 1539)  and high (n = 161) HA symptom scores. The association between HA symptoms assessed at age 5-7 years and HA symptoms at ages 11-12 years was examined by Stuart-Maxwell test. HA symptoms were significantly associated with emotional disorders and unspecific somatic complaints  but not with chronic physical conditions. In regression analyses controlling for gender and physical comorbidity  healthcare expenditure peaked in children with the highest HA symptom score  that is these children used on average approximately 150 Euro more than children with the lowest score during the 2-year period preceding inclusion. HA symptoms at age 5-7 years were significantly associated with HA symptoms at age 11-12 years. We conclude that HA symptoms  including hypochondriacal fears and beliefs  were non-trivial in preadolescents; they showed continuity from early childhood and association with emotional disorders  unspecific somatic complaints  and increased healthcare expenditure. Further research in the clinical significance of childhood HA is required.
General Practice,,,Functional somatic symptoms and consultation patterns in 5- to 7-year-olds. To investigate the frequency of and factors linked to medical consultation for functional somatic symptoms (FSS) among 5- to 7-year-old children. We assessed 1327 children from the Copenhagen Child Cohort 2000 for FSS at ages 5 to 7 years. Register data on past health care use in general practice were compared between children with and those without parent-reported medical consultation for FSS at the age of 5 to 7 years: respective consulters (n = 96) and nonconsulters (n = 211) and children without FSS (n = 1019). Degree of parental worries about the child's symptoms and parent-reported symptom characteristics and associated impacts were compared between consulters and nonconsulters. Among 308 children with FSS  31.1% were consulters. Being a consulter was significantly associated with multisymptomatic presentation  parental worries about the symptoms  symptom impact  and a higher past health care use in general practice. Multiple logistic regression analysis controlled for gender  comorbid physical disease  and symptom severity revealed that the number of face-to-face contacts in general practice during the child's first 4 years of life predicted being an consulter for FSS at 5 to 7 years (odds ratio 1.03  95% confidence interval 1.00-1.06; odds ratio interpreted per unit change in number of contacts). This study adds to our understanding of health care use for FSS in childhood by highlighting the influence of parents' early consultation patterns with their child and the influence of parental perceptions of their child's health and FSS-related impact on pediatric health care use for FSS. Management of health care use in children with FSS should address these aspects.
Family Practice,Otolaryngology,,[Parents satisfied with the grommet treatment in ear  nose and throat practice]. In Denmark  grommet insertion in the tympanic membrane is the most frequent type of surgery carried out on children. Denmark has a higher registered incidence of grommet treatment than the countries with which we normally compare ourselves. It is therefore relevant to study whether ear  nose and throat (ENT) specialists follow grommet treatment guidelines  and which children are treated with grommets. The study was planned as an observational survey with the individual child as observational unit for patient data. The ENT specialist was the observational unit for doctor behaviour. Data were collected in a double questionnaire study in which two questionnaires were completed by the ENT specialist and another two by the parents of each individual child. A total of 24 ENT specialists participated  and they included 426 children in the study. The majority of the children were observed between three and six months prior to surgery. In 32% (28-37%) of the cases  the specialist had no information describing how long the GP had observed the child. A total of 95% (92-97%) of the parents were satisfied with the grommet treatment and estimated that it had considerably improved the child's and the family's daily lives. The specialists followed the grommet treatment guidelines. Communication between specialists and GPs could be improved. Parents were satisfied with the treatment.
Orthopedics,,,Parathyroid hormone treatment increases fixation of orthopedic implants with gap healing: a biomechanical and histomorphometric canine study of porous coated titanium alloy implants in cancellous bone. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) administered intermittently is a bone-building peptide. In joint replacements  implants are unavoidably surrounded by gaps despite meticulous surgical technique and osseointegration is challenging. We examined the effect of human PTH(1-34) on implant fixation in an experimental gap model. We inserted cylindrical (10 × 6 mm) porous coated titanium alloy implants in a concentric 1-mm gap in normal cancellous bone of proximal tibia in 20 canines. Animals were randomized to treatment with PTH(1-34) 5 μg/kg daily. After 4 weeks  fixation was evaluated by histomorphometry and push-out test. Bone volume was increased significantly in the gap. In the outer gap (500 μm)  the bone volume fraction median (interquartile range) was 27% (20-37%) for PTH and 10% (6-14%) for control. In the inner gap  the bone volume fraction was 33% (26-36%) for PTH and 13% (11-18%) for control. At the implant interface  the bone fraction improved with 16% (11-20%) for PTH and 10% (7-12%) (P = 0.07) for control. Mechanical implant fixation was improved for implants exposed to PTH. For PTH  median (interquartile range) shear stiffness was significantly higher (PTH 17.4 [12.7-39.7] MPa/mm and control 8.8 [3.3-12.4] MPa/mm) (P < 0.05). Energy absorption was significantly enhanced for PTH (PTH 781 [595-1 198.5] J/m(2) and control 470 [189-596] J/m(2)). Increased shear strength was observed but was not significant (PTH 3.0 [2.6-4.9] and control 2.0 [0.9-3.0] MPa) (P = 0.08). Results show that PTH has a positive effect on implant fixation in regions where gaps exist in the surrounding bone. With further studies  PTH may potentially be used clinically to enhance tissue integration in these challenging environments.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Treatment of adult patients with schizophrenia and complex mental health needs - A national clinical guideline. The Danish Health and Medicines Authority assembled a group of experts to develop a national clinical guideline for patients with schizophrenia and complex mental health needs. Within this context  ten explicit review questions were formulated  covering several identified key issues. Systematic literature searches were performed stepwise for each review question to identify relevant guidelines  systematic reviews/meta-analyses  and randomized controlled trials. The quality of the body of evidence for each review question was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment  Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Clinical recommendations were developed on the basis of the evidence  assessment of the risk-benefit ratio  and perceived patient preferences. Based on the identified evidence  a guideline development group (GDG) recommended that the following interventions should be offered routinely: antipsychotic maintenance therapy  family intervention and assertive community treatment. The following interventions should be considered: long-acting injectable antipsychotics  neurocognitive training  social cognitive training  cognitive behavioural therapy for persistent positive and/or negative symptoms  and the combination of cognitive behavioural therapy and motivational interviewing for cannabis and/or central stimulant abuse. SSRI or SNRI add-on treatment for persistent negative symptoms should be used only cautiously. Where no evidence was available  the GDG agreed on a good practice recommendation. The implementation of this guideline in daily clinical practice can facilitate good treatment outcomes within the population of patients with schizophrenia and complex mental health needs. The guideline does not cover all available interventions and should be used in conjunction with other relevant guidelines.
Pediatrics,,,[Evaluation of satisfaction with training in tuition outpatient clinic]. An educational reform introduced by the National Health Board in 2004 made the Department of Paediatrics  Kolding Sygehus  introduce tuition outpatient clinics. To measure the quality of this initiative after 18 months  an evaluation was performed involving doctors in training positions  the supervising specialists  parents and adolescents. Residents receiving training as paediatricians or general practitioners staffed outpatient clinics where they were being supervised by consultants and nurses. This initiative was evaluated by an electronic questionnaire which was answered in May 2007 by all participants. The satisfaction of parents and adolescents was continuously monitored on a touch-screen computer between 1 January and 31 June 2007. Data are presented descriptively and differences compared by chi(2)-tests. Eleven of 15 (73%) residents and 5 of 6 (83%) consultants found that participating in outpatient clinics provided a good training opportunity. Residents found that teaching by demonstration was practiced more seldomly than stated by consultants (33% vs. 100%). In general  visitors' satisfaction was high. However  95% of parents and 90% of adolescents were satisfied by the explanations given by the consultants as compared with only 91% (p < 0.01) and 81% (p = 0.06)  respectively  for that given by the residents. Among the parents  97% had confidence in treatment given by the consultants as compared with 93% in that given by the residents (p = 0.02). Participation in outpatient clinics has a high training value. It seems that in the future communication should be in focus in the supervision of doctors in training positions.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Does Radiation Have a Role in Advanced Stage Hodgkin's or Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma? Radiation therapy (RT) is one of the most effective agents available in the treatment of lymphomas. However  it is a local treatment  and today  with systemic treatments assuming a primary role for induction of response  RT is primarily used for consolidation. For advanced stage lymphomas  the indications for the use of RT have been questioned and debated  and proper randomized evidence is sparse. RT has significant long-term side effects  and the very extended RT fields of the past yielded unacceptable toxicity in many patients. Modern advanced imaging and conformal RT techniques now enable treatment of larger and anatomically more challenging target volumes with much less radiation to normal tissues and consequently much lower risks of long-term complications. The modern concept of involved site radiation therapy (ISRT) has now been accepted as standard in lymphomas. In advanced Hodgkin lymphoma (HL)  RT to residual disease and/or initial bulk benefits some patients  depending on the chemotherapy regimen used. The more intensive the chemotherapy regimen  the fewer patients benefit from RT. In advanced aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)  most of the evidence comes from the most common type  the diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). In patients treated with modern immunochemotherapy  RT to initial bulky disease or extralymphatic involvement is beneficial. For both HL and aggressive NHL  RT to residual masses after systemic treatment is of benefit. The role of PET in the evaluation and indication for RT to residual masses has not been tested in randomized trials. In advanced indolent NHL  very low dose RT offers excellent palliation with very few side effects. Modern RT in advanced lymphomas warrants further evaluation in randomized trials.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Long-term-management of organ transplant recipients]. Due to advances in immunosuppressive therapy and surgical techniques  survival rates after solid organ transplantation have constantly improved over the last decades. In long-term care after transplantation  physicians need to focus as much on diagnosis and treatment of allograft-related complications as they should consider comorbidities and evaluate risk-factors and adverse events of immunosuppressive agents to prevent secondary diseases. In particular  cardiovascular and metabolic diseases  malignancy and infection play a major role in long-term survival. Therefore  screening of organ transplant recipients in regard to these complications and adverse events is a crucial part of follow up in these patients.
Occupational Therapy,,,The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure's semi-structured interview: its applicability to lumbar spinal fusion patients. A prospective randomized clinical study. Although lumbar spinal fusion has been performed for more than 70 years  few studies have examined rehabilitation strategies for spinal fusion patients  and there is only sparse information about the patient's activity level after surgery. The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) is a standardized semi-structured interview  developed to identify patients' problems in relation to activities of daily living (ADL). The COPM has neither been examined in a randomised clinical study nor employed in relation to lumbar spinal fusion patients. We aimed to examine whether or not the use of the semi-structured interview COPM during in-hospital rehabilitation could: (1) identify more ADL-related problems of importance to the patients after discharge from the hospital  (2) enhance the patients' ADL performance after discharge from hospital Eighty-seven patients undergoing a lumbar spinal fusion caused by degenerative diseases were randomly assigned to either use of the COPM or to standard treatment. Use of the COPM during hospitalization helped in identifying more ADL problems encountered by patients during the first 3 months post-discharge period as COPM served to identify more treatment goals and plans of action. Use of the COPM had no impact on the patients' ADL performance  and the difference is so small that COPM may be of little clinical consequence.
Family Practice,,,[Symptom presentation in cancer patients in general practice]. For the majority of cancer patients  the diagnostic investigations begin in general practice. The aim of the study was to investigate for which symptoms cancer patients consulted their general practitioner (GP). All newly diagnosed cancer patients and their GPs in the County of Aarhus  Denmark  participated in a 1-year questionnaire survey. The GPs answered questions about the patients' first presentation of cancer symptoms and the GPs' interpretation of these symptoms. A total of 2 212 (83%) questionnaires were answered. The total number of reported symptoms was 3 208 corresponding to 1.7 reported symptoms per patient. The majority (57.6%) of patients presented only one symptom. Symptoms varied with the type of cancer. Patients with breast cancer and malignant melanoma mainly presented with diagnosis-specific symptoms. Patients with colorectal  lung and prostate cancer presented diagnosis-specific symptoms (change in bowel habits  cough and bladder dysfunction) as well as more non-specific symptoms (pain  weight loss and fatigue). The GPs interpreted the symptoms as alarm symptoms in 49%  as general symptoms in 24% and as non-cancer specific symptoms in 27% of the patients. In general practice  incident cancer patients often present with few and non-cancer specific symptoms. The fact that only half of the patients presented with alarm symptoms complicates the GPs' diagnostic work-up and the use of fast track for suspected cancer. Therefore  there is a need for alternative referral pathways for cancer patients with non-cancer specific symptoms.
Forensic Medicine,,,Two decades of violence. A cohort study from the Danish municipality of Aarhus. Data collected from hospitals and the police has on several occasions proved to be useful in gaining knowledge about violence. The two casualty departments  Institute of Forensic Medicine and the police in Aarhus have co-operated in three earlier studies about interpersonal violence  the latest in 1993-1994. The purpose of this recent study is to reveal updated information about the incidence and character of violence in Aarhus. Dynamic cohort study during the period the 1st of April 1999 to the 31st of March 2000. Persons who after having been exposed to violence arrived at the casualty wards and Institute of Forensic Medicine were registered and interviewed. Also data from the police was collected. All results were compared to corresponding data collected from equally conducted studies in 1981-1982  1987-1988  and 1993-1994. The number of victims significantly decreased to 1496. The annual incidence rate decreased to 4.6 victims/1000. The decrease in violence was particularly among the 15-24 year old males. The extent of violence against women remained unchanged in 1999-2000. Foreigners were significantly higher represented among victims. The character and severity of violence were unchanged. Similar findings with overall decreasing incidence of violence  and on the other hand increasing violence among foreigners have been found in similar studies from Norway and England. Preventive actions should be regarded against the 15-24 year old males and foreigners.
Forensic Medicine,,,[Violence in Aarhus over two decades]. Data collected from hospitals and the police have on several occasions proved to be useful in gaining knowledge about violence. The casualty departments  the Institute of Forensic Medicine  and the police in Aarhus have co-operated in three earlier studies of inter-person violence  the latest in 1993-1994. The aim of this study was to update knowledge about the incidence and character of violence in Aarhus. A dynamic cohort study was carried out in the period 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2000. Persons who arrived at the casualty wards or Institute of Forensic Medicine after having been exposed to violence were registered and interviewed. Data from the police were also collected. All results were compared to corresponding data collected in 1981-1982  1987-1988  and 1993-1994. The number of victims decreased significantly to 1496. The annual incidence rate dropped to 4.6 victims/1000. This decrease in violence was particularly seen among 15-24-year-old males. The extent of violence against women remained unchanged in the years 1999-2000. Foreigners were significantly higher represented among the victims. The character and severity of the violence were unchanged. Similar findings with an overall decrease in the incidence of violence and  at the same time  an increase in violence among foreigners have been reported in studies from Norway and Britain. Preventive action should be considered in the groups of 15-24-year-old males and foreigners.
Epidemiology,,,High levels of bed occupancy associated with increased inpatient and thirty-day hospital mortality in Denmark. High bed occupancy rates have been considered a matter of reduced patient comfort and privacy and an indicator of high productivity for hospitals. Hospitals with bed occupancy rates of above 85 percent are generally considered to have bed shortages. Little attention has been paid to the impact of these shortages on patients' outcomes. We analyzed all 2.65 million admissions to Danish hospitals' departments of medicine in the period 1995-2012. We found that high bed occupancy rates were associated with a significant 9 percent increase in rates of in-hospital mortality and thirty-day mortality  compared to low bed occupancy rates. Being admitted to a hospital outside of normal working hours or on a weekend or holiday was also significantly associated with increased mortality. The health risks of bed shortages  including mortality  could be better documented as a priority health issue. Resources should be allocated to researching the causes and effects of bed shortages  with the aim of creating greater interest in exploring new methods to avoid or reduce bed shortages.
Family Practice,,,Opportunistic screening of young men for urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis infection in general practice. Chlamydia trachomatis is a widespread  sexually transmitted infection causing pelvic inflammatory disease  infertility  ectopic pregnancy and chronic pelvic pain among women. Asymptomatic infections among men contribute significantly to maintaining the spread of the infection. In a 1-y intervention study in general practices we aimed to evaluate an opportunistic screening programme targeting 16-25-y-old men. When the young men saw their general practitioner (GP) for the first time during the intervention y  they were offered a test for C. trachomatis based on a first catch urine sample. Main outcome measures were percentage of tested men and prevalence of infection in the intervention practices compared with the test activity in the rest of the county during the intervention y and the y before. GPs in the intervention practices saw 617 (75.6%) of the 814 registered young men during the intervention period. Screening was offered to 300 (48.6%) and 219 (26.9% of the target population) accepted the invitation. The prevalence of infection among screened men was 5.0%. We conclude that opportunistic screening for urogenital C. trachomatis infection in general practice is feasible.
Pediatrics,,,[Clinical communication skills training is an educational challenge]. This qualitative study presents results from a development project of clinical communication skills training for physicians in a paediatric ward. Overall  the doctors express that the training positively supports their clinical work and that it provides a model for discussing communication challenges with colleagues. Challenges  however  are time constraints and overcoming conventional hierarchical structures. Prerequisites for ward-based communication training thus are: a suitable timeframe  use of a structured feedback model  managerial backup  and support from external expertise.
Pathology  Clinical,,,World Health Organization-defined classification of myeloproliferative neoplasms: morphological reproducibility and clinical correlations--the Danish experience. We examined inter- and intraobserver reproducibility and concordance between histological diagnosis and independently collected clinical findings in a large series of patients with the major subtypes of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) and controls. Seven hematopathologists reviewed 272 bone marrow biopsies including 43 controls. Diagnoses were determined according to the 2008 criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO). The participants were blinded to all clinical data except patient age. After initial evaluation all hematopathologists participated in a 3-day meeting with a leading clinician chaired by an expert hematopathologists. In cases with lack of consensus on fiber grading (n = 57)  a new evaluation was performed. In cases with discordance on morphological diagnosis (n = 129)  an additional nonblinded evaluation taking clinical data into consideration was carried out. For remaining cases with a lack of concordance between morphological diagnosis and clinical diagnosis (n = 33)  a similar nonblinded evaluation was performed. Consensus on final histological diagnosis and concordance with clinical diagnosis were determined. Blinded histological evaluation resulted in a 53% consensus rate. After re-evaluation of fiber content  consensus was reached in 60% of cases. Adding clinical data increased the histological consensus to 83%. For cases with a histological consensus  we found a concordance of 71% with the clinician's diagnoses. This is the first study to present a larger cohort of MPN patients mimicking the diagnostic challenges that hematopathologists face in their daily practice. The results support the postulates of the WHO that both morphological and clinical findings are essential for a valid diagnosis
Epidemiology,,,Risk of epilepsy and autism in full and half siblings-A population-based cohort study. Epilepsy and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often occur together in the same individual. However  it remains unknown whether siblings of children with ASD have an increased risk of epilepsy and vice versa. This study determines the risk of ASD and epilepsy among younger siblings of children with ASD and epilepsy. The study included all children born in Denmark between January 1  1980 and 31 December 2006 who participated in follow-up until December 31  2012 (1 663 302 children). We used Cox regression to calculate the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) and the Kaplan-Meier method to calculate the cumulative incidence. The overall aHR of epilepsy in younger siblings increased by 70% (aHR 1.70  95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34-2.16%) if the older sibling had ASD compared with siblings where the older sibling did not have ASD. The cumulative incidence of epilepsy at 20 years of age was 2.54% (95% CI 1.97-3.26%) if the older sibling had ASD  whereas the cumulative incidence of epilepsy at 20 years of age was 1.63% (95% CI 1.60-1.66%) if the older sibling did not have ASD. The overall aHR of ASD in younger siblings increased by 54% if the older sibling had epilepsy (aHR 1.54  95% CI 1.32-1.80) compared with siblings where the older sibling did not have epilepsy. The cumulative incidence of ASD at 20 years of age was 2.06% (95% CI 1.84-2.32%) if the older sibling had epilepsy  whereas the cumulative incidence of ASD at 20 years of age was 1.27% (95% CI 1.25-1.29%) if the older sibling did not have epilepsy. The cross-disorder sibling risk of epilepsy and ASD was increased for the two disorders  which suggests that genes or environmental factors shared by family members may play a causal role in the co-occurrence of ASD and epilepsy.
Neurology,,,Epilepsy as a risk factor for hepatic encephalopathy in patients with cirrhosis: a cohort study. Epilepsy is associated with an increased mortality among cirrhosis patients  but the reasons are unknown. We aimed to determine whether epilepsy is a risk factor for developing hepatic encephalopathy (HE)  which is a strong predictor of mortality. We used data from three randomized 1-year trials of satavaptan in cirrhosis patients with ascites. With Cox regression  we compared the hazard rates of HE grade 1-4 between those cirrhosis patients who did or did not have epilepsy. We adjusted for confounding by gender  age  cirrhosis etiology  diabetes  history of HE  Model for Endstage Liver Disease (MELD) score  serum sodium  albumin  lactulose use  rifaximin use  and benzodiazepine/barbiturate sedation. In a supplementary analysis we examined the association between epilepsy and the hazard rate of HE grade 2-4. Of the 1120 cirrhosis patients with ascites  21 (1.9 %) were diagnosed with epilepsy. These patients had better liver function at inclusion than the patients without epilepsy (median MELD score 7.9 vs. 11.4)  and only one died during the trials. Nevertheless  seven patients with epilepsy had an HE episode during the follow-up  and the adjusted hazard ratio of HE grade 1-4 for patients with epilepsy vs. controls was 2.12 (95 % CI 0.99-4.55). The corresponding hazard ratio of HE grade 2-4 was 3.83 (95 % CI 1.65-8.87). Our findings suggest that epilepsy is associated with an increased risk of HE in patients with cirrhosis.
Epidemiology,,,Long-term mortality in children and young adults with epilepsy--A population-based cohort study. Epilepsy is associated with an increased mortality. This study estimates the effects of co-morbid disorders on short-term and long-term mortality and presents cause-specific mortality for children and young adults with epilepsy. We established a population-based cohort of 1 855 946 children born in Denmark from 1977 to 2006. Children were followed from the 29th day of life until death  emigration or 31 December 2006. Data was retrieved from Danish longitudinal civil service  health and cause of death registries. Overall  25 244 persons were diagnosed with epilepsy and 10 647 persons died during 26.2 million person years of follow-up. Among those who died  803 were diagnosed with epilepsy prior to death. Mortality rate ratio (MRR) was estimated by comparing the mortality rate among persons with epilepsy with the mortality rate in persons without epilepsy. The mortality among children and young adults with epilepsy was almost 15 times increased compared with persons without epilepsy (MRR: 14.9 (95% CI: 13.9-16.1)). After excluding persons with adverse birth outcomes and persons with comorbid neurological disorders (other than epilepsy)  the MRR was still more than four times increased (MRR: 4.20 (95% CI: 3.28-5.30)). Short- and long-term MRRs were particularly high for those diagnosed with epilepsy before 5 years of age (short-term mortality (<1 year); MRR: 41.5 (95% CI: 35.4-48.3)  long term mortality (≥ 1 year); MRR: 21.6 (95% CI: 19.5-23.8)). The cumulative mortality 20 years after the first epilepsy diagnosis was 7.6% (95% CI: 6.8-8.4%) among males and 5.8% (95% CI: 5.1-6.5%) among females.
Gynecology,Medical Oncology,Oncology Nursing,Paradoxes of follow-up - health professionals' views on follow-up after surgical treatment in gynecological cancer. Evidence now reveals that attending a follow-up program may not improve survival for low-stage gynecological cancer patients. The aim of this study was to explore health professionals' experiences with the follow-up programs and their views on follow-up in the future. A qualitative approach was undertaken with semi-structured focus group interviews. Three focus group interviews were conducted at neutral ground. One group with onco-gynecologists  one group with specialist nurses  and one mixed group. The main themes of the interviewguide were: Existing follow-up program  life after cancer and future follow-up. The interviews were transcribed verbatim. Patterns and themes were uncovered from the data inspired by interpretive description. The doctors described most advantages  such as: Quality control of their own work  detection of sequelae after surgery  and credit and appraisal from the patients. A disadvantage was the inadequate use of the nurses' main competencies. Some dilemmas were described by the nurses as well as doctors: First  both groups were aware of the existing evidence that attendance of follow-up programs may not improve survival and yet  health professionals still performed the follow-ups and most often did not address this paradox for the patients. Second  the existing follow-up program seemed to bring the patients comfort and security on one hand  but on the other hand it seemed to induce insecurity and anxiety. The health professionals agreed that future follow-up should be individualized with focus on the single patients' needs and psychological wellbeing. The health professionals identified a great challenge in communicating the evidence and the forthcoming changes in the follow-up programs to the patients. This study revealed that the existing follow-up regime contains several dilemmas. According to the health professionals  future follow-up must be more individualized  and a shift in focus is needed from relapse to quality of life after cancer.
Evidence-Based Practice,,,Ovarian cancer surgery: health and coping during the perioperative period. The study objective was to survey general health and coping in women undergoing ovarian cancer surgery  and subsequently to develop and test a supportive care intervention. Women who underwent surgery on the suspicion of ovarian cancer participated in a follow-up questionnaire study in which the Short Form-36 Questionnaire was used to survey general health twice during the perioperative period and the Life Orientation Questionnaire (SOC) was used once to define the postoperative coping capacity. An evidence-based  preoperative supportive care programme was subsequently developed and tested. This consisted of lean methodology applied to clinical pathways  preoperative optimisation  and psychosocial care and support. From 294 women allocated to three study groups  a total of 546 Short Form-36 questionnaires and 253 SOC questionnaires were available for analysis. The overall response rate was 86 %. The presence of ascites  a pelvic mass  and a Risk of Malignancy Index >200 proved to be appropriate clinical markers for intensified preoperative care. Concerning physical health  levels were low throughout the perioperative period; the majority however stayed within standard levels. Concerning mental health  levels were below standard during the entire period  but did improve with time  also in women in whom the potential cancer diagnosis was refuted. The preoperative differences between these groups leveled out postoperatively in terms of physical health. At the end of the perioperative period  the coping capacity was close to normal. A need for supportive care during the perioperative period was identified. This should be adjusted to the nature of the disease and the extent of the treatment. Participation in a preoperative supportive programme supported physical health during the perioperative period; however  further support of mental health seemed required.
Family Practice,,,[Knowledge of human papilloma virus-associated disease among women in general practice]. Cervical cancer is caused by oncogenic human papilloma virus (HPV) serotypes. Types 16 and 18 are responsible for approximately 75% of all cases in Europe. Low-malignant serotypes like HPV 6 and 11 are the cause of approximately 90% of all cases of conyloma accuminata. Approximately 75% of the adult population has or will become infected by one or more HPV serotypes. The purpose of the study was to investigate the level of knowledge of the cause of cervical cancer  cervical dysplasia and condylomas among women seen in Danish general practice  and to investigate the women's expectations to communication with regard to prophylactic initiatives and  finally  to determine which aspects would influence their wish for HPV-vaccination. Patient questionnaire in 26 general practices between September 2006 through February 2007. A total of 425 women aged 14-39 years were included in the study. Only 1.2% of the women correctly stated HPV as the cause of cervical cancer and 0.7% stated HPV as the cause of condylomas. In all  96.2% thought that general practitioners should actively inform their patients of prophylactic initiatives such as vaccination against cervical cancer. Among all women  96.4% considered HPV-vaccination. In this population  knowledge about the cause of cervical cancer and condylomas was limited. There was a clear wish - and expectation - to be actively informed on prophylactic initiatives by the general practitioner.
Nursing Methodology Research,Oncology Nursing,,Facing possible illness detected through screening--experiences of healthy women with pathological cervical smears. The aim of this study is to gain knowledge about women's perceptions of illness based on their abnormal PAP smears  following screening for cervical cancer. The study uses a phenomenological  hermeneutic approach inspired by Ricoeur's theory of interpretation. Twelve women  aged between 23 and 59 years  were consecutively selected and then followed by participant observation during their examinations and treatment in hospital. They were interviewed on entering the study  a week following their surgery  and 6 months later. The material collected was analysed through a dialectic process consisting of a face-value review of participant experiences (naive reading)  structural analysis and  critical interpretation of what it means to be potentially ill. The women were unprepared to find that their screening results showed abnormal cells  indicative of incipient genital cancer. They were frustrated by the results as they had not experienced any symptoms and felt well  despite being diagnosed with a potential disease. Being diagnosed with abnormal cells caused the participants to feel anxious. Their anxiety had subsided 6 months after the cells had been removed. For those who did not require treatment  anxiety flared up with recurrent check-ups. The bio-medical differentiation between pre-stage and actual cancer provided no comfort to the participants  who continued to see themselves as having early stage cancer.
Emergency Medicine,,,Basic life support skill retention by medical students: a comparison of two teaching curricula. In December 2005 the new guidelines for resuscitation were released and a new curriculum for the teaching of basic life support (BLS) was adopted. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effectiveness of the new guidelines and teaching curriculum on the BLS skill retention of medical students 1 year following their initial training. The study was conducted in two consecutive academic years and compared BLS skill retention of two groups of medical students in their fourth year of medicine. The first group (group A) was taught the old guidelines with the old curriculum in the year 2005 and was re-assessed in 2006  and the second group (group B) was taught the new guidelines with the new curriculum in the year 2006 and was re-assessed in 2007. Significantly more students in group B assessed signs of life  located the compression area correctly and performed good quality chest compressions compared with the group taught the old guidelines with the old curriculum. The most important BLS skill  good quality chest compressions  was retained by significantly more students who were taught the new resuscitation guidelines according to the new curriculum.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Adherence to guidelines in bleeding oesophageal varices and effects on outcome: comparison between a specialized unit and a community hospital. Randomized controlled trials have shown beneficial effects of vasoactive drugs  endoscopic treatment and prophylactic antibiotics on the outcome of bleeding oesophageal varices (BOV). However  translating guidelines based on randomized controlled trials into clinical practice is difficult. Our aims were to compare adherence to evidence-based guidelines in BOV between a specialized unit and a community hospital  and to investigate whether differences in adherence affected the outcome. Two cohorts hospitalized during 2000-2007 with a first episode of BOV were retrospectively enrolled  one in a community hospital comprising 66 patients and one in a specialized unit comprising 111 patients. Data on treatment  rebleeding and mortality were collected from medical records according to the Baveno III/IV Criteria. Treatments in the specialized unit versus the community hospital were: vasoactive drugs 79 vs. 66% (P = 0.06)  prophylactic antibiotics 55 vs. 27% (P < 0.01)  endoscopic treatment 86 vs. 74% (P= 0.04) and Sengstaken-Blakemore tube was used in 5 vs. 21% (P < 0.01). Secondary prophylaxis with pharmacological  endoscopic or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt therapy was initiated in 91 vs. 74% (P < 0.01) (specialized vs. community). Six-week mortality was 17 vs. 24% (P = 0.25) with 5-day mortality of 6 vs. 3% (P = 0.34) and mortality day 6-42  12 vs. 22% (P = 0.07) (specialized vs. community). Failure to control bleeding and failure to prevent rebleeding were not statistically different. Our study shows that patients with BOV are more likely to receive therapy according to guidelines when hospitalized in a specialized unit compared with a community hospital. This however did not affect mortality.
Precision Medicine,,,Individualization of treatments with drugs metabolized by CES1: combining genetics and metabolomics. CES1 is involved in the hydrolysis of ester group-containing xenobiotic and endobiotic compounds including several essential and commonly used drugs. The individual variation in the efficacy and tolerability of many drugs metabolized by CES1 is considerable. Hence  there is a large interest in individualizing the treatment with these drugs. The present review addresses the issue of individualized treatment with drugs metabolized by CES1. It describes the composition of the gene encoding CES1  reports variants of this gene with focus upon those with a potential effect on drug metabolism and provides an overview of the protein structure of this enzyme bringing notice to mechanisms involved in the regulation of enzyme activity. Subsequently  the review highlights drugs metabolized by CES1 and argues that individual differences in the pharmacokinetics of these drugs play an important role in determining drug response and tolerability suggesting prospects for individualized drug therapies. Our review also discusses endogenous substrates of CES1 and assesses the potential of using metabolomic profiling of blood to identify proxies for the hepatic activity of CES1 that predict the rate of drug metabolism. Finally  the combination of genetics and metabolomics to obtain an accurate prediction of the individual response to CES1-dependent drugs is discussed.
Pharmacogenetics,,,Genome-wide identification of structural variants in genes encoding drug targets: possible implications for individualized drug therapy. The objective of the present study was to identify structural variants of drug target-encoding genes on a genome-wide scale. We also aimed at identifying drugs that are potentially amenable for individualization of treatments based on knowledge about structural variation in the genes encoding their targets. Information about human drug targets of all therapeutic drugs and nutraceuticals approved by the Food and Drug Administration and with an Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) code  namely  876  was obtained from the DrugBank and applied to interrogate the Database of Genomic Variants. We identified 1721 structural variants  which affected 495 of 1005 different genes encoding drug targets. About 70% of the Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs had targets subjected to structural variation  in particular copy number variation. The distribution of drugs with targets encoded by copy number variable genes differed between ATC groups with pronounced over-representation in ATC group N  that is  nervous system drugs (P=3.75e-5). Several narrow therapeutic index drugs with targets subjected to genomic structural variation were identified. Information about the frequencies of the structural variants and drug consumption allowed us to identify potential candidates for implementation in pharmacogenetic testing and individualized drug treatments. Structural variants in pharmacodynamic genes may play a larger role in determining individual variation in drug responses than currently believed. Inclusion of such genes in pharmacogenetic testing holds promising prospects as they may have large effect sizes.
General Practice,,,Study protocol of an economic evaluation of an extended implementation strategy for the treatment of low back pain in general practice: a cluster randomised controlled trial. In Denmark  guidelines on low back pain management are currently being implemented; in association with this  a clinical trial is conducted. A health economic evaluation is carried out alongside the clinical trial to assess the cost-effectiveness of an extended implementation strategy to increase the general practitioners' adherence to the guidelines. In addition to usual dissemination  the extended implementation strategy is composed of visits from a guideline facilitator  stratification tools  and feedback on guideline adherence. The aim of this paper is to provide the considerations on the design of the health economic evaluation. The economic evaluation is carried out alongside a cluster randomised controlled trial consisting of 60 general practices in the North Denmark Region. An expected 1 200 patients between the age of 18 and 65 years with a low back pain diagnosis will be enrolled. The economic evaluation comprises both a cost-effectiveness analyses and a cost-utility analysis. Effectiveness measures include referral to secondary care  health-related quality of life measured by EQ-5D-5L  and disability measured by the Roland Morris disability questionnaire. Cost measures include all relevant additional costs of the extended implementation strategy compared to usual implementation. The economic evaluation will be performed from both a societal perspective and a health sector perspective with a 12-month time horizon. It is expected that the extended implementation strategy will reduce the number of patients referred to secondary care. It is hypothesised that the additional upfront cost of extended implementation will be counterbalanced by improvements in clinical practice and patient-related outcomes  thereby rendering the extended implementation strategy cost-effective.

Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Clinical database for intensive care patients]. Intensive care contributes to a substantial part of health care expenses. Admission to intensive care units is associated with a high mortality rate and a high risk of long-term disability. Data from several studies suggest that suboptimal standards of intensive care are relatively common. Lack of knowledge regarding the use of intensive care and long-term outcome as well as the effectiveness and adverse effects of intensive care impede a systematic and evidence-based development and quality improvement. An initiative to establish a Danish national clinical database for intensive care has been launched.
Immunochemistry,,,Highly glycosylated alpha1-acid glycoprotein is synthesized in myelocytes  stored in secondary granules  and released by activated neutrophils. Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) is an acute-phase protein produced by hepatocytes and secreted into plasma in response to infection/injury. We recently assessed the transcriptional program of terminal granulocytic differentiation by microarray analysis of bone marrow (BM) populations highly enriched in promyelocytes  myelocytes/metamyelocytes (MYs)  and BM neutrophils. These analyses demonstrated a transient  high mRNA expression of genuine secondary/tertiary granule proteins and AGP in MYs. In agreement with this  immunocytochemistry revealed the presence of AGP protein and the secondary granule protein lactoferrin in cells from the MY stage and throughout granulocytic differentiation. Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated the colocalization of AGP and lactoferrin in secondary granules of neutrophils. This finding was substantiated by the failure to detect AGP and lactoferrin in blood cells from a patient with secondary/tertiary (specific) granule deficiency. In addition  Western blot analysis of subcellular fractions isolated from neutrophils revealed that neutrophil-derived AGP  localized in secondary granules  was abundant and highly glycosylated compared with endocytosed  plasma-derived AGP localized in secretory vesicles. Exocytosis studies further demonstrated a marked release of AGP and lactoferrin by activated neutrophils. Finally  induction of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)-epsilon in a myeloid cell line was shown to increase AGP transcript levels  indicating that AGP expression in myeloid cells  like in hepatocytes  is partially regulated by members of the C/EBP family. Overall  these findings define AGP as a genuine secondary granule protein of neutrophils. Hence  neutrophils  which constitute the first line of defense  are likely to serve as the primary local source of AGP at sites of infection or injury.
Colorectal Surgery,,,[Organisation and early outcome of restorative proctocolectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis]. Restorative proctocolectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) has become the operation of choice for patients with ulcerative colitis and familial polyposis. However  the procedure is complex with a long learning curve  and carries a risk of both early and late complications. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the early outcomes (within 30 days after surgery) and organisation of IPAA surgery in Denmark between January 2001 and December 2005. IPAA patients >18 years old were drawn from the Danish National Patient Registry from 2001 through 2005. Hospital stay and the primary operation were recorded as well as re-operations and readmissions within the first 30 postoperative days. Mortality was recorded from the National Civic Register. 385 patients underwent IPAA surgery during the study period (77/year) in six centres. One centre performed 31% of the operations. The mean postoperative hospital stay (primary - and readmission within 30 days) was 13.5 days. 24% were readmitted within 30 days and 8% were re-operated. The mortality rate was 0.3%. Based upon the limited number of operations  the high risk of early readmissions and re-operations  the well-known steep learning curve and the potential improvement with the technically demanding laparoscopic technique  a reorganisation of the procedure to fewer centres is suggested.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Profile of a systematic search. Search areas  databases and reports]. Systematic literature search is a fundamental in evidence-based medicine. But systematic literature search is not yet a very well used way of retrieving evidence-based information. This article profiles a systematic literature search for evidence-based literature. It goes through the most central databases and gives an example of how to document the literature search. The article also sums up the literature search in all reviews in Ugeskrift for Laeger in the year 2004.
Community Health Nursing,,,Can a general health surveillance between birth and 10 months identify children with mental disorder at 1(1/2) year? A case-control study nested in cohort CCC 2000. Mental health surveillance in infancy was studied in an existing child health surveillance programme with child psychiatric disorder at 1(1/2) year as the outcome. Children considered of concern by community health nurses were cases in a case control study nested in the Copenhagen Child Cohort (CCC 2000). Outcome was mental health status at 1(1/2) year assessed by clinical and standardised strategies  including videotape recordings  parent interviews and the instruments: CBCL 1(1/2)-5  ITSCL  CHAT  Bayley Scales of Infant Development II  PC ERA and PIR-GAS. The positive predictive value of concern in the first 10 months of living was 24% (CI 17.0-31.9)  the negative predictive value was 85% (CI 77.9-89.6) and the sensitivity was 56% (CI 42.4-69.0). Concern about development was significantly associated with the child having a neuro-developmental disorder at 1(1/2) year  and concern about mother-child relationship was associated with emotional  behavioural  eating  and sleeping disturbances. A general health surveillance program seems to have potentials to identify infants at risk for mental health problems provided standardised measures and specific training of the involved health professionals.
Child Psychiatry,,,The Copenhagen County child cohort: design of a longitudinal study of child mental health. Epidemiological studies of psychopathology in the first years of life are few  and the association between mental health problems in infancy and psychiatric disturbances later in life has not been systematically investigated. The aim of the present project was to study mental health problems and possibilities of intervention from infancy and onward. The basic study population consists of a birth cohort of 6 090 children born in the year 2000 in the County of Copenhagen  the Copenhagen County Child Cohort  CCCC 2000. At stage one CCCC 2000 was established on data from the Civil Registration System  Danish national registers  and standardized  longitudinal data from the first year of living obtained by public health nurses. At stage two a subsample was assessed at 1(1/2) years of age concerning child psychiatric illness and associated factors in a case-control study nested in the cohort  including a random sample. Participation rate at stage one was 92%. Ongoing studies of CCCC 2000 include studies of failure to thrive  register studies  and studies of the predictive validity of public health screening. A follow-up study concerning the prevalence of psychopathology at age 5 is planned. The Copenhagen County Child Cohort CCCC 2000 is a longitudinal study of mental health from infancy investigating psychopathology in early childhood. Results from this study will add to the knowledge of risk factors and course of mental health problems in childhood and contribute to the validation of the mental health screening made by public health nurses.
Medicine,,,The incidence of invasive pneumococcal serotype 3 disease in the Danish population is not reduced by PCV-13 vaccination. Since 2010  Denmark has included the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV-13) in the childhood immunization programme. However  serotype 3 remains as an important cause of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in Denmark. IPD surveillance data (1999-2016) was used to calculate the incidence and age-distribution of serotype 3 IPD  and the effect of PCV-13 on serotype 3 IPD incidence was examined. The incidence of serotype 3 IPD in the age group below 65 years was 0.51/100 000 pre PCV-13  and 0.45/100 000 post PCV-13. In the group 0-4 years  serotype 3 IPD incidence was 0.28/100 000 pre PCV-13  and 0.16/100 000 post PCV-13. Serotype 3 IPD incidence in the elderly showed a mean of 4.27/100 000 pre PCV-13  and 4.32/100 000 post PCV-13. PCV-13 childhood immunization in Denmark has not lead to a reduction of the incidence of IPD caused by serotype 3. The reason behind this missing effect needs to be investigated further.
Forensic Pathology,,,Forensically significant scavenging guilds in the southwest of Western Australia. Estimation of time since death is an important factor in forensic investigations and the state of decomposition of a body is a prime basis for such estimations. The rate of decomposition is  however  affected by many environmental factors such as temperature  rainfall  and solar radiation as well as by indoor or outdoor location  covering and the type of surface the body is resting upon. Scavenging has the potential for major impact upon the rate of decomposition of a body  but there is little direct research upon its effect. The information that is available relates almost exclusively to North American and European contexts. The Australian faunal assemblage is unique in that it includes no native large predators or large detrivorous avians. This research investigates the animals that scavenge carcasses in natural outdoor settings in southern Western Australia and the factors which can affect each scavenger's activity. The research was conducted at four locations around Perth  Western Australia with different environmental conditions. Pig carcasses  acting as models for the human body  were positioned in an outdoor environment with no protection from scavengers or other environmental conditions. Twenty-four hour continuous time-lapse video capture was used to observe the pattern of visits of all animals to the carcasses. The time of day  length of feeding  material fed upon  area of feeding  and any movement of the carcass were recorded for each feeding event. Some species were observed to scavenge almost continually throughout the day and night. Insectivores visited the carcasses mostly during bloat and putrefaction; omnivores fed during all stages of decomposition and scavenging by carnivores  rare at any time  was most likely to occur during the early stages of decomposition. Avian species  which were the most prolific visitors to the carcasses in all locations  like reptiles  fed only during daylight hours. Only mammals and amphibians  which were seldom seen during diurnal hours  were nocturnal feeders. The combined effects of the whole guild of scavengers significantly accelerated the later stages of decomposition  especially in the cooler months of the year when natural decomposition was slowest.
Family Practice,,,The quality of COPD care in general practice in Denmark: the KVASIMODO study. We studied the quality of care for COPD patients in a large sample of general practices in Denmark. We focussed on whether participation by general practitioners (GPs) in an educational programme could enhance the use of spirometry in the diagnosis and staging of the disease and improve adherence to COPD guidelines. We performed two audit surveys of GPs' patients' notes  one year apart  before and after an educational programme for participating GPs and their staff. A total of 154 GPs participated in the study. 2549 patient records were included in the first survey and 2394 in the second. Based on analysis of all patient records  we observed a substantial improvement in the quality of care: recording of FEV1 improved from 52.7% of cases in the first survey to 71.4% in the second (p< 0.001). There was a significant improvement in the recording of body mass index and provision of smoking cessation advice  recommendation of physical activity  checking of inhalation technique  dietary instruction  and referral to pulmonary rehabilitation. We also found a decline in the use of inhaled corticosteroids in patients with mild COPD  from 60.2% in the first survey to 48.8% in the second. When analysing the results focussing on the performance of single GPs there was an improvement in quality  but this was less than the improvement for patients overall - suggesting that improvement in quality of care was not equally distributed throughout the GPs' practices. We conclude that it is possible to improve the quality of COPD care by educating GPs and their staff.
Pediatrics,,,Pediatric observation units. Pediatric observation units (OUs) are hospital areas used to provide medical evaluation and/or management for health-related conditions in children  typically for a well-defined  brief period. Pediatric OUs represent an emerging alternative site of care for selected groups of children who historically may have received their treatment in an ambulatory setting  emergency department  or hospital-based inpatient unit. This clinical report provides an overview of pediatric OUs  including the definitions and operating characteristics of different types of OUs  quality considerations and coding for observation services  and the effect of OUs on inpatient hospital utilization.
Rehabilitation,,,Outpatient management of intensively treated acute leukemia patients--the patients' perspective. In recent years  patients with acute leukemia (AL) have  to a greater extent  been managed in an outpatient setting where they live at home but appear every other day for follow-up visits at hospital. This qualitative article elucidates how patients with AL experience the different conditions of the inpatient and outpatient settings and how they reflect on these transitions in order to create meaning in and keep up everyday life. Qualitative semi-structured individual interviews twice with each AL patient focusing on the outpatient setting  impact on everyday life  responsibility and the home were performed. Twenty-two patients were interviewed the first time  and 15 of these were interviewed the second time. The data were analyzed in an everyday life relational perspective. Outpatient management facilitates time to be administrated by the patients and thereby the possibility of maintaining everyday life  which was essential to the patients. The privacy ensured by the home was important to patients  and they accepted the necessary responsibility that came with it. However  time spent together with fellow patients and their relatives was an important and highly valued part of their social life. Approached from the patient perspective  outpatient management provided a motivation for patients as it ensured their presence at home and provided the possibility of taking part in everyday life of the family  despite severe illness and intensive treatment. This may suggest a potential for extending the outpatient management further and also for patient involvement in own care.
Molecular Epidemiology,,,Sequence analysis of the capsid gene during a genotype II.4 dominated norovirus season in one university hospital: identification of possible transmission routes. Norovirus (NoV) is a leading cause of gastroenteritis and genotype II.4 (GII.4) is responsible for the majority of nosocomial NoV infections. Our objective was to examine whether sequencing of the capsid gene might be a useful tool for the hospital outbreak investigation to define possible transmission routes. All NoV positive samples submitted from one university hospital during the 2007/8 season were selected. Genotyping of selected samples by partial polymerase gene sequencing had shown that the majority belonged to the GII.4 variant Den Haag 2006b and had identical polymerase sequences. Sequences of the capsid gene (1412 nucleotides) were obtained from the first available sample from 55 patients. From six immunocompromised patients with persistent infections a second sample was also included. As a control for a point-source outbreak  five samples from a foodborne outbreak caused by the same GII.4 variant were analyzed. Forty-seven of the inpatients (85%) were infected with the GII.4 variant Den Haag 2006b. Phylogenetic analysis of the Den Haag 2006b sequences identified four distinct outbreaks in different departments and a fifth outbreak with possible inter-department spread. In addition  a more heterogeneous cluster with evidence of repeated introductions from the community  but also possible inter-department spread was observed. In all six patients with paired sequences  evidence for in vivo evolution of the virus was found. Capsid gene sequencing showed substantial sequence variation among NoV GII.4 variant Den Haag 2006b strains from one single institution during a nine months' period. This method proved useful to understand the local epidemiology and  when used promptly  has the potential to make infection control measures more targeted.
Global Health,,,Bodily distress syndrome: A new diagnosis for functional disorders in primary care? Conceptualisation and classification of functional disorders appear highly inconsistent in the health-care system  particularly in primary care. Numerous terms and overlapping diagnostic criteria are prevalent of which many are considered stigmatising by general practitioners and patients. The lack of a clear concept challenges the general practitioner's decision-making when a diagnosis or a treatment approach must be selected for a patient with a functional disorder. This calls for improvements of the diagnostic categories. Intense debate has risen in connection with the release of the fifth version of the 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders' and the current revision of the 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems'. We aim to discuss a new evidence based diagnostic proposal  bodily distress syndrome  which holds the potential to change our current approach to functional disorders in primary care. A special focus will be directed towards the validity and utility criteria recommended for diagnostic categorisation. A growing body of evidence suggests that the numerous diagnoses for functional disorders listed in the current classifications belong to one family of closely related disorders. We name the underlying phenomenon 'bodily distress'; it manifests as patterns of multiple and disturbing bodily sensations. Bodily distress syndrome is a diagnostic category with specific criteria covering this illness phenomenon. The category has been explored through empirical studies  which in combination provide a sound basis for determining a symptom profile  the diagnostic stability and the boundaries of the condition. However  as bodily distress syndrome embraces only the most common symptom patterns  patients with few but impairing symptoms are not captured. Furthermore  the current lack of treatment options may also influence the acceptance of the proposed diagnosis. Bodily distress syndrome is a diagnostic category with notable validity according to empirical studies. Nevertheless  knowledge is sparse on the utility in primary care. Future intervention studies should investigate the translation of bodily distress syndrome into clinical practice. A particular focus should be directed towards the acceptability among general practitioners and patients. Most importantly  it should be investigated whether the new category may provide the basis for better treatment and improved clinical outcome.
General Practice,,,Enhanced care by generalists for functional somatic symptoms and disorders in primary care. Patients with medically unexplained or functional somatic symptoms are common in primary care. Previous reviews have reported benefit from specialised interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy and consultation letters  but there is a need for treatment models which can be applied within the primary care setting. Primary care studies of enhanced care  which includes techniques of reattribution or cognitive behavioural therapy  or both  have shown changes in healthcare professionals' attitudes and behaviour. However  studies of patient outcome have shown variable results and the value of enhanced care on patient outcome remains unclear. We aimed to assess the clinical effectiveness of enhanced care interventions for adults with functional somatic symptoms in primary care. The intervention should be delivered by professionals providing first contact care and be compared to treatment as usual. The review focused on patient outcomes only. We searched the Cochrane Depression  Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group Specialised Register (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) (all years to August 2012)  together with Ovid searches (to September 2012) on MEDLINE (1950 - )  EMBASE (1980 - ) and PsycINFO (1806 - ). Earlier searches of the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE)  CINAHL  PSYNDEX  SIGLE  and LILACS were conducted in April 2010  and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in October 2009. No language restrictions were applied. Electronic searches were supplemented by handsearches of relevant conference proceedings (2004 to 2012)  reference lists (2011) and contact with authors of included studies and experts in the field (2011). We limited our literature search to randomised controlled trials (RCTs)  primary care  and adults with functional somatic symptoms. Subsequently we selected studies including all of the following: 1) a trial arm with treatment as usual; 2) an intervention using a structured treatment model which draws on explanations for symptoms in broad bio-psycho-social terms or encourages patients to develop additional strategies for dealing with their physical symptoms  or both; 3) delivery of the intervention by primary care professionals providing first contact care; and 4) assessment of patient outcome. Two authors independently screened identified study abstracts. Disagreements about trial selections were resolved by a third review author. Data from selected publications were independently extracted and risk of bias assessed by two of three authors  avoiding investigators reviewing their own studies. We contacted authors from included studies to obtain missing information. We used continuous outcomes converted to standardised mean differences (SMDs) and based analyses on changes from baseline to follow-up  adjusted for clustering. We included seven studies from the literature search  but only six provided sufficient data for analyses. Included studies were European  cluster RCTs with adult participants seeing their usual doctor (in total 233 general practitioners and 1787 participants). Methodological quality was only moderate as studies had no blinding of healthcare professionals and several studies had a risk of recruitment and attrition bias. Studies were heterogeneous with regard to selection of patient populations and intensity of interventions. Outcomes relating to physical or general health (physical symptoms  quality of life) showed substantial heterogeneity between studies (I(2) > 70%) and post hoc analysis suggested that benefit was confined to more intensive interventions; thus we did not calculate a pooled effect. Outcomes relating to mental health showed less heterogeneity and we conducted meta-analyses  which found non-significant overall effect sizes with SMDs for changes at 6 to 24 months follow-up: mental health (3 studies) SMD -0.04 (95% CI -0.18 to 0.10)  illness worry (3 studies) SMD 0.09 (95% CI -0.04 to 0.22)  depression (4 studies) SMD 0.07 (95% CI -0.05 to 0.20) and anxiety (2 studies) SMD -0.07 (95% CI -0.38 to 0.25). Effects on sick leave could not be estimated. Three studies of patient satisfaction with care all showed positive but non-significant effects  and measures were too heterogeneous to allow meta-analysis. Results on healthcare utilisation were inconclusive. We analysed study discontinuation and found that both short term and long term discontinuation occurred more often in patients allocated to the intervention group  RR of 1.25 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.46) at 12 to 24 months. Current evidence does not answer the question whether enhanced care delivered by front line primary care professionals has an effect or not on the outcome of patients with functional somatic symptoms. Enhanced care may have an effect when delivered per protocol to well-defined groups of patients with functional disorders  but this needs further investigation. Attention should be paid to difficulties including limited consultation time  lack of skills  the need for a degree of diagnostic openness  and patient resistance towards psychosomatic attributions. There is some indication from this and other reviews that more intensive interventions are more successful in changing patient outcomes.
Forensic Psychiatry,,,[Forensic psychiatric patients in Denmark]. In Denmark the number of forensic psychiatric patients is increasing. The objective of this study was to explore whether the increased number of forensic psychiatric patients has been reflected in the use of psychiatric inpatient facilities. Furthermore  we wanted to investigate differences in the treatment of various diagnostic groups of forensic patients and of forensic and non-forensic patients with schizophrenia. Information about admissions and outpatient contact was extracted from the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register for all Danish patients sentenced to psychiatric treatment in the period 1994-2003. Furthermore  a group of first-admission forensic patients suffering from schizophrenia was compared to a control group of first-admission non-forensic patients with schizophrenia  matched for sex  age and time of admission. The number of forensic psychiatric patients increased markedly in the period 1994-2003; at the same time  the use of inpatient facilities for this group of patients did not increase to a similar degree but actually decreased. Forensic patients in the group F20-F29 spent more time in hospital than did forensic patients with affective disorders and personality disorders. Forensic psychiatric patients with schizophrenia had significantly longer periods of hospitalization than did non-forensic patients with schizophrenia. Forensic psychiatric patients' use of psychiatric inpatient facilities during the last 10 years did not increase to the extent expected relative to the increasing number of forensic psychiatric patients. This raises the question of whether these patients are receiving necessary and sufficient treatment.
Epidemiology,Gastroenterology,,Outcome of 24 years national surveillance in different hereditary colorectal cancer subgroups leading to more individualised surveillance. Individuals with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) have a high risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). The benefits of colonic surveillance in Lynch syndrome and Amsterdam-positive (familial CRC type X familial colorectal cancer type X (FCCTX)) families are clear; only the interval between colonoscopies is debated. The potential benefits for families not fulfilling the Amsterdam criteria are uncertain. The aim of this study was to compare the outcome of colonic surveillance in different hereditary subgroups and to evaluate the surveillance programmes. A prospective  observational study on the outcome of colonic surveillance in different hereditary subgroups based on 24 years of surveillance data from the national Danish HNPCC register. We analysed 13 444 surveillance sessions  including 8768 incidence sessions and 20 450 years of follow-up. CRC was more incident in the Lynch subgroup (2.0%) than in any other subgroup (0.0-0.4%  p<0.0001)  but the incidence of advanced adenoma did not differ between the Lynch (3.6%) and non-Lynch (2.3-3.9%  p=0.28) subgroups. Non-Lynch Amsterdam-positive and Amsterdam-negative families were similar in their CRC (0.1-0.4%  p=0.072)  advanced adenoma (2.3-3.3%  p=0.32) and simple adenoma (8.4-9.9%  p=0.43) incidence. In moderate-risk families  no CRC and only one advanced adenoma was found. The risk of CRC in Lynch families is considerable  despite biannual surveillance. We suggest less frequent and more individualised surveillance in non-Lynch families. Individuals from families with a strong history of CRC could be offered 5-year surveillance colonoscopies (unless findings at the preceding surveillance session indicate shorter interval) and individuals from moderate-risk families could be handled with the population-based screening programme for CRC after an initial surveillance colonoscopy.
General Practice,,,Quality indicators for treatment of respiratory tract infections? An assessment by Danish general practitioners. In 2008  a set of 41 quality indicators for antibiotic treatment of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in general practice were developed in an international setting as part of the European project HAPPY AUDIT. To investigate Danish general practitioners' (GPs') assessment of a set of internationally developed quality indicators and to explore if there is an association between the GPs' assessment of the indicators and their practice characteristics as well as their antibiotic prescription pattern. A total of 102 Danish GPs were invited to assess the 41 quality indicators. The GPs were categorized into two groups according to their assessment of indicators. Data concerning practice characteristics and antibiotic treatment were obtained during a three-week registration of patients with RTIs and were linked to the GPs' assessments of the indicators. A total of 62 (61%) responded. Quality indicators focusing on the frequency of prescribing of narrow-spectrum penicillin were rated as suitable by more than 80% of the Danish GPs  while quality indicators concerning cephalosporins or quinolones were rated suitable by less than half of the GPs. The antibiotic prescribing pattern differed significantly and the GPs who disagreed on most indicators prescribed more macrolides and less narrow-spectrum penicillin than the GPs who agreed on most indicators. Even though an international expert panel agreed on a set of quality indicators for antibiotic treatment of RTIs  only a few of them were rated suitable by the GPs  who are supposed to use them.
Epidemiology,,,The impact of ventilation tubes in otitis media on the risk of cholesteatoma on a national level. To estimate the impact of treatment with middle ear ventilation tube insertion (VTI) in children with otitis media (OM) on the risk of cholesteatoma on a national level. Data were obtained from the Danish National Patient Register  the National Health Service Register and Statistics Denmark. Cumulative incidence proportions were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and hazard ratios with Cox regression analysis. The first surgically treated middle ear cholesteatoma in a child (STMEC1) was considered an event. A total of 217 206 children  born after December 31  1996  who had VTI from January 1  1997 to August 31  2011 were identified. Of these  374 subsequently had a STMEC1. A corresponding 36 981 children without any VTI were identified for comparison using a random 5% sample of the Danish population. Of these  5 had a STMEC1. The cumulative incidence proportion with STMEC1 at 12 years of age for children with 0  1  2  3  and ≥4 VTI's was 0.04% (95% confidence interval 0.02-0.12%)  0.21% (0.18-0.26%)  0.35% (0.28-0.43%)  0.40% (0.30-0.54%)  and 0.55% (0.44-0.70%)  respectively. In the regression model each additional year of age before the first VTI increased the risk of STMEC1 by 54% (47-63%)  while each additional year between two successive tube insertions increased the risk by 28% (15-43%). We found that prolonged OM requiring multiple VTIs was associated with an increased risk of STMEC1. Early age at first VTI and short time between two VTIs was associated with a lower risk of STMEC1. This may be the result of reduced time with negative middle ear pressure and OM. However  these findings may be susceptible to selection bias  as age at first VTI and time between VTIs  as well as the outcome variable  STMEC1  may all depend on the underlying indication for VTI. In short the present study suggests that treatment with VTI in children with OM reduces the risk of STMEC1 on a population level. However  for the individual child the absolute risk reduction is very small  and the decision of treatment with VTI must always rely on the symptoms and clinical findings in the individual child.
Epidemiology,,,Cholesteatoma in Danish children - a national study of changes in the incidence rate over 34 years. To describe temporal trends in the incidence rate of surgically treated middle ear cholesteatoma in Danish children from 1977 to 2010. Data on surgically treated middle ear cholesteatoma was drawn from the Danish National Patient Register. A change in incidence rate over time was examined using Poisson regression analysis  while the cumulative incidence proportion was estimated using life-tables. A total of 5850 cases of surgically treated middle ear cholesteatoma distributed among 3874 children aged 0-15 years were identified. From 1977 to 2002 the age-standardized incidence rates for first-time surgically treated middle ear cholesteatoma increased from 8 to 15 per 100 000 person-years with an estimated annual increase of 1.8% (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-2.2%). From 2002 to 2010 the rates decreased from 15 to 10 per 100 000 person-years with an annual decrease of 5.4% (95% CI 3.2-7.5%). Age-specific incidence rates were at maximum around the age of 9 years during the whole period. The estimated cumulative incidence proportion at age 16 years based on the 2010 age-specific incidence rates was 0.16% (95% CI 0.09-0.32%) compared with 0.20% (95% CI 0.11-0.37%) based on the 2000 age-specific incidence rates. From 2002 to 2010 there was a decrease in the incidence rate of first-time surgically treated middle ear cholesteatoma. The decrease was preceded by a significant increase in the incidence rate of middle ear ventilation tube insertion. However  further studies are needed to find possible explanations for the decrease.
Epidemiology,,,Increasing rate of middle ear ventilation tube insertion in children in Denmark. To study the incidence rates of middle ear ventilation tube insertion in children aged 0 to 15 years in Denmark from 1997 to 2010. Using two national registers  the Danish National Health Service Register and the Danish National Patient Register  practically all cases of middle ear ventilation tube insertion performed in Denmark in the period were identified. A possible change in incidence rate over time was examined using Poisson regression analysis  while the cumulative incidence proportion was estimated using life-tables. A total of 502 569 uni- or bilateral ventilation tube insertions distributed among 269 459 different children were identified. From 1997 to 2010 the age standardized incidence rate in 0-15-year-olds increased from 26 to 40 per 1000 person years with an estimated annual increase of 2.0% (95% confidence interval 1.9-2.1%). The largest increase in incidence rate was found in 1-year-olds with an annual increase of 4.5% (95% confidence interval 4.4-4.6%). Age-specific incidence rates remained at maximum around the age of 14 months throughout the period. The cumulative incidence proportion for the 2010 birth cohort by the time they reach the age of 5 years was estimated to 29% (95% confidence interval 28-29%). The rate for middle ear ventilation tube insertion in Denmark was high compared to other developed countries  and an estimated 3 in 10 children born in 2010 will undergo at least one ventilation tube insertion before their fifth birthday.
Orthopedics,,,Parathyroid hormone--possible future drug for orthopedic surgery. Parathyroid hormone naturally secreted by the parathyroid glands is a potent anabolic agent for bone. Parathyroid hormone is primarily thought of as a catabolic protein involved in the physiologic release of calcium from bone. Whereas during recent years  a number of animal studies and clinical trials have demonstrated that intermittent parathyroid hormone administration induces anabolic effects on both cancellous and cortical bone  enhances bone mass and increases mechanical strength of the bones. Most of the studies  both animal and human  have addressed the treatment of osteoporosis and parathyroid hormone represents an important new advance in the therapy of osteoporosis. Few studies have investigated the effect of intermittent parathyroid hormone treatment in the field of orthopedics on fracture healing and fixation of orthopedic implants. The results of those studies indicated an enhancement of fracture healing  faster bone repair and better fixation of the implant. Recently there were few animal studies started to investigate the effects of parathyroid hormone treatment on bone formation in regenerated and surrounding bone of distracted callus during limb lengthening. Distraction osteogenesis is a technique for bone lengthening that is widely used clinically and experimentally. Newly forming bone during distraction osteogenesis is expected to be an appropriate pattern for parathyroid hormone anabolic effect. Preclinical studies as well as clinical trials suggest that parathyroid hormone might be useful as a stimulator of bone formation whereas a lot of questions regarding parathyroid hormone therapy remain unanswered and require further experimental studies and investigations.
Orthopedics,,,[Child orthopedics]. Children's fractures are a challenge to the treatment system  in that 17 000 children are treated in Denmark each year. The true burden on patients and society is unknown. It is estimated that 1000 new-born infants are treated for hip instability in Denmark per year  and 30 are diagnosed late. Ultrasound scanning is recommended for secondary screening and selective screening of children at risk. Identification of acetabular dysplasia followed by surgical correction could be an important prophylactic measure  with a potential reduction in expenses to society. To some extent  congenital clubfoot is hereditary. Environmental factors are important  maternal smoking being one. Early operative treatment yields good results. There is a need for prospective registration. Perthes' disease is an idiopathic necrosis of the capital femoral epiphysis. Passive smoking is a significant factor. A young age (< 7 years) and limited necrosis carry a good prognosis  and active treatment can improve the prognosis for the other patients.
Psychiatry,,,[Intersectorial co-operation in psychiatry]. Critical intersectorial problems of co-operation are revealed through an organizational psychological analysis focusing on intergroup dynamics. The aim of the paper is to examine and improve the intersectorial co-operation in psychiatry and present a new trio-interview design that includes patients as well as staff. Results from a follow-up study investigating the co-operation between Psychiatric Center Amager (PCA) and socialpsychiatric institutions (SPI) in Copenhagen is presented and analysed. The study was based on data gathered via structured interviews with patients and staff from both sectors (n = 60 in 2005  n = 87 in 2007)  employing quantitative as well as qualitative methods. The newly developed trio-interview design with informant-triads for studies of the quality of intersectorial co-operation in psychiatry was applied to the study. Quantitative data from the patients showed that the co-operation was generally considered to be unsatisfactory in 2005 and 2007. SPI satisfaction estimates concerning the latest hospitalization period were higher in 2007 than in 2005. Staff from both sectors estimated that co-operation was significantly higher during 2007 than during 2005. Qualitative data showed that in 2007  staff was the decisive factor. The co-operation was estimated to be unsatisfactory in 2005 and 2007. Measures to strengthen intersectorial co-operation were implemented in 2006  but had limited effect.
Epidemiology,,,Death and thrombo-embolic risk after ablation of atrial flutter compared with atrial fibrillation: a nationwide cohort study. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is a similar mortality and thrombo-embolic risk  after an atrial ablation procedure  compared with an atrial fibrillation (AF) procedure. Using data from nationwide Danish health registries  we identified patients aged 18-75 years undergoing a first-time atrial flutter or an AF ablation procedure in the period 2000-13. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) after 5 years of follow-up  adjusting for concomitant risk factors. A total of 1096 and 2266 patients underwent an ablation for atrial flutter or AF  respectively. Age distribution was similar in the two  but atrial flutter patients had more co-morbidities. During 5 years of follow-up  we observed 38 and 36 deaths in the atrial flutter and AF groups  corresponding to an almost two-fold higher mortality rate among atrial flutter patients [crude HR 1.92  95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22-3.03]. The higher mortality rate persisted after adjustment for age  sex  diabetes mellitus  and hypertension (adjusted HR 1.68  95% CI 1.05-2.69). The rate of thrombo-embolic events was similar in the two groups (crude HR 1.34  95% CI 0.71-2.56; adjusted HR 1.22  95% CI 0.62-2.41). In this observational study  patients with atrial flutter had a significantly higher all-cause mortality rate compared with those with AF after an ablation procedure  but similar thrombo-embolic event rates. Future studies should elucidate the reason for this difference in mortality.
Geriatric Psychiatry,,,[The occurrence of coercive measures towards non-hospitalized elderly]. The study is a nation-wide investigation of the occurrence of coercive measures towards non-hospitalised elderly (+65 years) with dementia in Denmark. These measures include the use of alarm and tracking systems  use of physical force and protective devices  detention of the elderly in their own homes  and forced movement to another domicile e.g. nursing home. These types of coercive measures are regulated in the Danish jurisdiction  but not systematically recorded. A questionnaire was sent to all counties in Denmark concerning occurrence of the coercive measurements mentioned above. All 14 counties reported a very low use of all types of coercion with only a total of 123 incidents reported in all in 2001. This modest number gives rise to concern about lack of sufficient care towards elderly with dementia. The autonomy of the demented is important  but must not overrule basic care with the aim of ensuring dignified living conditions and safety from harm. The jurisdiction in this area is complicated and sometimes unclear.
Rheumatology,,,Routine database registration of biological therapy increases the reporting of adverse events twentyfold in clinical practice. First results from the Danish Database (DANBIO). To present from the Danish Database for Biological Therapies in Rheumatology (DANBIO) the frequencies and types of adverse events as well as risk factors during treatment with biological agents in clinical practice. Adverse events during the first 2 years of clinical use of biological agents in Denmark were reported to the nationwide DANBIO and compared to the mandatory reports to the Danish Medicines Agency. Almost 90% of the patients treated with biological agents were registered in the DANBIO  and the database picked up 20 times as many adverse events as the Danish Medicines Agency. Infections and hypersensitivity reactions were the most prevalent adverse events. Age  disease duration  and previous number of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDS) were found to be risk factors for bacterial infections. A routine-based Danish database for biological therapies covers approximately 90% of patients and improves the reporting of adverse events.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[The complexity of the implementation of an observation and tracking chart for critical illness]. Critically ill patients on wards are identified too late. At Aarhus University Hospital  Aarhus Sygehus  staff did not act appropriate to unacceptable values. The solution presented is development and implementation of a Track and Trigger System: a standardised observation chart encompassing frequency of vital signs measurement combined with a decision algorithm based on scores dictating skill level of decision-making. Educational programmes and specialist function for ward staff as well as action cards containing identification  situation  background  analysis  and advice and an airway  breathing  circulation  disability and environment approach to support clinical decision-making are introduced.
Orthodontics,,,A report on the use of Er:YAG laser for pilot hole drilling prior to miniscrew insertion. The aim of the present in vitro study was to investigate the required time period of the Er:YAG laser that is used for drilling through cortical bone when pilot hole drilling is needed before miniscrew insertion. Even though Er:YAG laser is used in various in vivo and in vitro studies  there is no accepted procedure of laser for depth control during drilling through cortical bone. The study sample consisted of 120 cortical bone segments having 1.5 and 2.0 mm of cortical bone thickness. An Er:YAG laser  with a spot size of 1.3 mm and an air-water spray of 40-50 ml/min  was used. The laser was held 2 mm away from and perpendicular to the bone surface with different laser settings. Twelve specimens were prepared for each subgroup. As the cortical bone thickness increased  the time needed to drill through the bone increased. Frequency increase directly caused a decrease in irradiation duration. When three different frequency  three different energy  and four different power values were tested for both the 1.5- and 2-mm cortical bone thicknesses  the shortest duration needed to drill through cortical bone was seen in the 3.6-W (300 mJ-12 Hz) setting. When pilot holes are drilled prior to miniscrew placement in 1.5 to 2 mm of cortical bone using Er:YAG laser  the most appropriate value is found with the 3.6-W (300 mJ-12 Hz) setting.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Laparoscopic and open subtotal colectomy for inflammatory bowel disease]. Studies have shown that laparoscopic colectomy (LC) for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is just as safe as open colectomy. Some of the short-term advantages of laparoscopy are faster recovery  less pain  shorter hospital stay and fewer complications. The long-term advantages include superior cosmetic result  reduced intra abdominal adhesion formation  less frequent hospitalization due to small bowel obstruction and fewer incisional hernias. Cost-benefit analyses also favour laparoscopic surgery for IBD.
Global Health,,,Premature subclinical atherosclerosis in children and young adults with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. A review considering preventive measures. Many studies show that Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is associated with early subclinical signs of atherosclerosis. Chronic inflammation per se may be an important driver but other known risk factors  such as dyslipidemia  hypertension  insulin insensitivity  a physically inactive lifestyle  obesity  and tobacco smoking may also contribute substantially. We performed a systematic review of studies through the last 20 years on early signs of subclinical atherosclerosis in children and adolescents with JIA with the purpose of investigating whether possible risk factors  other than inflammation  were considered.We found 13 descriptive cross sectional studies with healthy controls  one intervention study and two studies on adults diagnosed with JIA. Only one study addressed obesity  and physical activity (PA) has only been assessed in one study on adults with JIA and only by self-reporting. This is important as studies on PA in children with JIA have shown that most patients are less physically active than their healthy peers  and as physical inactivity in several large studies of normal schoolchildren is found to be associated with increased clustering of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. It is thus possible that an inactive lifestyle in patients with JIA is an important contributor to development of the subclinical signs of atherosclerosis seen in children with JIA  and that promotion of an active lifestyle in childhood and adolescence may diminish the risk for premature atherosclerotic events in adulthood.
Evidence-Based Medicine,Occupational Therapy,Stroke Rehabilitation,Evaluation of evidence within occupational therapy in stroke rehabilitation. Evidence-based practice creates practice that integrates research-driven evidence with clinical expertise and patients' preferences in clinical decision-making. The aim of this study was to investigate and evaluate the quality and applicability of scientific research in occupational therapy intervention related to the use of everyday life occupations and client-centred practice within stroke rehabilitation. Systematic searches of research studies published in English during 2000-2007 in peer-reviewed journals were undertaken. Thirty-nine articles and one Cochrane review were appraised and the quality evaluated using an evidence taxonomy and an evidence hierarchy. Evidence arose providing support for a client-centred approach  entailing outcome related to better ability to recall goals  the patients feeling more involved and able to manage more everyday life occupations after rehabilitation. There is also considerable evidence for the use of everyday life occupations in occupational therapy. Occupational therapy was evaluated as an important aspect of stroke rehabilitation improving outcomes in everyday life occupations including activities of daily living (ADL) and participation. As research of relevance for the profession to a large extent includes qualitative research it gives rise to reflection on including more tools than the evidence hierarchy while evaluating evidence within occupational therapy.
Specialization,,,Use of professional profiles in applications for specialist training positions. The seven roles of the CanMEDS system have been implemented in Danish postgraduate medical training. For each medical specialty  a professional profile describes which elements of the seven roles the specialty deems important for applicants for a specialist training position. We investigated use of professional profiles among the 38 Danish specialty societies in order to ascertain the use of the seven roles. We used information from the websites of the Postgraduate Medical Training Secretariats in March 2012. For each profile  we extracted information on how the seven roles were described  how the roles were ranked by importance  whether a score sheet was used by the appointment committee and whether the profile had been updated. Twenty-four (63%) of the 38 profiles described the contents for all of the seven roles and four (11%) described the contents only for some of the roles. Nine specialties (24%) described a clear ranking of the seven roles with the medical expert and scholar roles generally ranked as most important. Seven specialties (18%) used standardised score sheets as part of the application process. Four (11%) specialties had updated their professional profiles. The majority of specialties described the seven roles in their professional profiles  but the level of detail varied substantially. Few specialties described whether the roles were ranked by importance or provided specific guidelines for appointment committees on how the contents of the profiles should be interpreted. We suggest that specialties seek inspiration for updating their profiles  and that they use the contents from all specialties provided at a website. not relevant. not relevant.
Pediatrics,,,[Multiple mini interviews before the occupation of main training posts in paediatrics]. Interviews are mandatory in Denmark when selecting doctors for training positions. We used multiple mini interviews (MMI) at four recruitment rounds for the main training posts in paediatrics. In total  125 candidates were evaluated and assessed by CV and MMI (4-5 stations). Reliability for individual stations in MMI assessed by Cronbach's alpha was adequate (0.63-0.92). The overall reliability assessed by G-theory was lower  suggesting that different skills were tested. The acceptability was high. Our experiences with MMI suggest good feasibility and reliability. An increasing number of stations may improve the overall reliability.
Internal Medicine,,,[Length of stay in medical departments. Similarities and differences in Denmark]. The relation between the length of stay after admission to a medical ward  the available resources  and the quality of the results is not well established. There is no documentation that allocation of resources results in improved quality. In Denmark we have recently focused on the quality of cancer treatment and have allocated resources without any evidence that it will improve survival  whereas less attention has been paid to less prestigious diseases. Length of stay can be an indicator of quality  as we operate with an efficient work process as a goal. But it is not a goal by itself  as only when coupled with cure or improvement in the disease can it be worth aiming at. We therefore compared the length of stay in Danish Departments of Internal Medicine to look for differences or similarities. MATERIAL AN METHODS: The homepage of the Danish National Board of Health  www.tal.dk (now terminated) was visited and data drawn for analyses. Six days seems to be the average length of stay in most departments  with some extreme deviations. A tendency towards a short stay in the department of Cardiology and a long term stay in the Geriatric Department was found as expected  but again extreme deviations were seen. No typical pattern was seen in the length of stay. A short stay is not attractive in itself  only when combined with a high quality of care and a healthy economy. Conversely  too short a stay can be risky if it is because of overcrowding and this must be prevented.
Adolescent Psychiatry,Child Psychiatry,,Child and adolescent psychiatry and family status: a nationwide register-based study. Much attention has been given to parental separation as a possible risk factor for adverse child development; however  little information is available regarding the family status of children referred to psychiatric facilities. To assess the association between psychiatric illness in childhood and family status compared to the background population. Data was derived from a national register on children referred to psychiatric facilities in Denmark and a databank containing detailed statistical information on the Danish society. Regardless of age significantly fewer children with psychiatric illnesses lived with both biological parents as compared to the background population (51.1% vs 73.3%). There were no gender differences. Analyses of the specific diagnoses association with family status revealed only few significant differences. Psychiatrically ill children are at increased risk of not living with both biological parents independent of age of the child.
Forensic Medicine,,,[Traumatic basal subarachnoid hemorrhage]. Massive subarachnoid hemorrhage may occur on a traumatic basis. The injury is most often sustained by a blow with a clenched fist against the posterolateral part of the cranial basis  but the injury may also occur in relation to an accident. The condition is rare  most often occurring in alcohol intoxicated men. The victim typically collapses immediately and usually dies within a few minutes. The origin of the bleeding may be the vertebral artery on the neck or the intercranial basal brain arteries. In some cases the origin of the bleeding cannot be located. The pathogenetic mechanisms have been a subject of discussion. The damage to the artery may occur in relation to a fracture of the transverse process of the atlas or in relation to subluxations in the cervical vertebral column. The arterial rupture may occur in both normal and abnormal arteries. In many of the cases the trauma may be very slight. This has  of course  important legal implications.
Pediatrics,,,Medical students' assessment of pediatric patients - teaching and evaluation using video cases. We introduced video-based teaching in pediatrics. We evaluated the impact of a pediatric video program on student performance in assessing pediatric patients presented as video cases. The program consisted of a library of pediatric videos  and inclusion of these in the teaching and examination for pediatric medicine. Medical students on a pediatric clerkship at the University of Copenhagen assessed eight short pediatric video cases during autumn 2011 and spring 2012. Two independent observers evaluated a subset of records in a pilot study. A blind evaluation was made of the written records of 37 students before  and 58 students after  the introduction of the program using a Rubric score with four domains. The intraobserver interclass correlation coefficient was 0.94 and the interobserver interclass correlation was 0.71(n=25). The students' mean total Rubric score in spring 2012 (7.0) was significantly higher (p<0.001  95% CI 1.34-3.20) than autumn 2011 (4.7). Cohen's d was 1.1 (95% CI 0.6-1.7). Single domains scores increased significantly for general assessment (1.30 versus 0.57) (p<0.002  95% CI 0.45-1.18)  recognition of principal symptoms (1.38 versus 0.81) (p<0.008  95% CI 0.22-0.91)  appropriate diagnosis (2.28 versus 1.78) (p<0.002  95% CI 0.16-0.82) and consistency between observed symptoms and diagnosis (1.94 versus 1.57) (p=0.0482  95% CI 0.00-0.79). Students improved in evaluating pediatric patients presented as video cases after the introduction of the program. The impact on real-life situations remains to be established.
Dermatology,Telemedicine,,Teledermatology on the Faroe Islands. The use of teledermatology as an adjunct to conventional clinical dermatology on the Faroe Islands is described. The service is based on a nurse-led dermatological clinic  and teledermatology is combined with specialist visits for more complex diagnosis or procedures.
Specialization,,,[Gender  qualifications and choice of specialty of younger physicians in Denmark 1998-2003]. The purpose of this study is to describe differences in specialty choices and qualifications between male and female physicians at the start of their residency in Denmark 1998-2003. Data consist of all applications for residency in the period 1998-2003 in 21 medical specialties. 1 920 physicians in residency are included in the study. Their gender is compared with specialty choices  age and points achieved on supplementary criteria. Over 80% of the residents in child and youth psychiatry and gynaecology/obstetrics were women. 87% of the residents in orthopaedic surgery were men. No gender differences were found in biological age and candidate age at the start of residency. Women achieved higher points for clinical qualification and theoretical courses  while the male residents achieved the highest points for scientific and pedagogical qualification. Within the individual medical specialties there were no gender differences. Gender does not have independent influence on achieved residency  but the study shows that there are gender differences in specialty choice and in the way men and women qualify for residency. The clear differences between men and woman across medical specialties are not matched by similar differences within each specialty. Gender differences thus seem determined by differences in specialty choice. The study results can help create the basis for the future medical residency and can guide the considerations of specialty societies  young physicians and other interested parties with regard to recruitment and specialty profile.
Family Practice,,,[Vaginal discharge--diagnosis and treatment in general practice]. Based on a review of the literature  this article describes the most common causes of vaginal discharge including changes in the woman's perception of her vaginal secretion  disturbances in the vaginal microbiological environment (vulvovaginal candidiasis and bacterial vaginosis)  and infection with Chlamydia trachomatis. The article attempts to answer a number of questions which this condition poses to the clinician. It is concluded that with the available diagnostic possibilities the general practitioner is in a good position to make a correct diagnosis and institute an effective treatment.
Pathology,,,YKL-40 and mast cells are associated with detrusor fibrosis in patients diagnosed with bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis according to the 2008 criteria of the European Society for the Study of Interstitial Cystitis. Bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis (BPS/IC)  diagnosed according to the new 2008 criteria of the European Society for the Study of Interstitial Cystitis (ESSIC)  may lead to detrusor fibrosis. In some inflammatory diseases  fibrosis is related to YKL-40. The aims were to examine YKL-40 antigenic expression in bladder tissue and levels in serum and urine in BPS/IC and to evaluate whether YKL-40 could be a non-invasive  prognostic biomarker for bladder fibrogenesis and treatment intensity. Immunohistochemistry  immunoelectron microscopy and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analyses in 45 patients showed YKL-40 expression in detrusor mast cell granules and submucosal macrophages  and elevated YKL-40 levels in serum and urine compared to healthy individuals (median 72 versus 7 μg/l  P < 0.001). Clinicopathological parameters showed associations of detrusor fibrosis with YKL-40-positive cells (P = 0.001)  mast cells (P = 0.014) and urine YKL-40 (P = 0.009). Bladder capacity correlated inversely with YKL-40-positive cells (P < 0.001) and mast cells (P = 0.029). Treatment intensity was not associated with YKL-40. Serum and urine levels of YKL-40 may be used as non-invasive biomarkers in BPS/IC for the evaluation of bladder fibrogenesis.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Nutrition and pressure ulcers among old people]. In 2004 a Cochrane review was published with the objective of evaluating the effectiveness of nutritional support in the prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers. It was not possible for the reviewers to draw any definitive conclusions. A recent meta-analysis of five randomised controlled trials (four included in the Cochrane review)  however  found a significantly lower incidence of pressure ulcer development in at-risk patients compared with those in routine care (OR 0.74; 95% CI 0.62-0.88). These results are still a matter of discussion. Both articles concluded that further research is needed.
Hospital Administration,,,Cardioversion and Risk of Adverse Events with Dabigatran versus Warfarin-A Nationwide Cohort Study. Cardioversion can rapidly and effectively restore sinus rhythm in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation. Since 2011 dabigatran has been available as an alternative to warfarin to prevent thromboembolic events in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation undergoing cardioversion. We studied time to cardioversion  risk of adverse events  and risk of readmission with atrial fibrillation after cardioversion according to anticoagulation therapy. Through the nationwide Danish registries we included 1 230 oral anticoagulation naïve patients with first time non-valvular atrial fibrillation and first time cardioversion from 2011 to 2012; 37% in the dabigatran group (n = 456)  and 63% in the warfarin group (n = 774). Median time to cardioversion was 4.0 (interquartile range [IQR] 2.9 to 6.5) and 6.9 (IQR 3.9 to 12.1) weeks in the dabigatran and warfarin groups respectively  and the adjusted odds ratio of cardioversion within the first 4 weeks was 2.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7 to 3.1) in favor of dabigatran. The cumulative incidence of composite endpoint of stroke  bleeding or death were 2.0% and 1.0% at 30 weeks in the warfarin and dabigatran groups respectively  with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.33 (95% CI 0.33 to 5.42). Cumulative incidence of readmission with atrial fibrillation after 30 weeks were 9% and 11% in the warfarin and dabigatran groups  respectively  and an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.66 (95% CI 0.41 to 1.08). Anticoagulation treatment with dabigatran allows shorter time to cardioversion for atrial fibrillation than warfarin  and appears to be an effective and safe alternative treatment strategy to warfarin.
Family Practice,,,Academic detailing has no effect on prescribing of asthma medication in Danish general practice: a 3-year randomized controlled trial with 12-monthly follow-ups. Educational outreach visits  particularly when combined with social marketing  appear to be a promising approach to modifying health professional behaviour  especially prescribing. Results from previous studies have shown a varying effect. The purpose of the study is to examine the effect of academic detailing as a method of implementing a clinical guideline in general practice. A cluster randomized  controlled  blinded study was carried out of the effect of an academic detail visit compared with postal distribution of a guideline for prescribing asthma medication. Half the practices in a Danish county with 100 practices were visited once. The outcome measure was routinely collected data from all Danish pharmacies on the sales of asthma medication. Data were collected monthly for 2 years before to 1 year after the intervention. There was no effect on the pattern of prescription of asthma medicines following the visit  neither immediately nor long term. We found no effect of academic detailing as a single intervention.
Family Practice,,,Positive self-assessed general health in patients with medical problems. A qualitative study from general practice. Patient and doctor do not always agree on the status of the patient's health. By underestimating the patient's strong sides  the doctor may be contributing to disempowerment and bypassing knowledge needed for adequate medical diagnosis and management. To understand how our patients with medical problems assess their general health as good. Qualitative observational study based on audiotaped material from general practice consultations in authors' practices (Norway and Denmark). The patients were asked to rate their current state of health on a scale ranging from zero to 100  and then to explain their score. From 41 consecutive consultations we compiled a purposeful sample of 12 patients who reported positive self-assessed general health although medical problems were present. The 7 women and 5 men were aged between 43 and 96 years  and had been diagnosed with musculoskeletal disorders  heart disease  cancer  depression  headache or severe menopausal symptoms. Salutogenesis  represented by the authors' Health Resource/Risk Balance Model  and Antonovsky's Sense of Coherence (SOC) concept comprised the theoretical framework. Transcripts from audiotaped consultations were used for qualitative text condensation analysis  inspired by Giorgi's phenomenological method. Analysis was theory-driven  applying comprehensibility  manageability and meaningfulness as entries to elaborate patients' accounts of positive health. Patients' answers demonstrated how a feeling of logical reasoning related to symptom perception could provide comfort and sometimes lead to advantageous coping strategies. Personal and social resources were mentioned as essential means for tolerating and managing the burden of disease. Even fairly extensive endeavours could be experienced as worthwhile when sometimes providing relief  even only temporarily. Patients' accounts of general health can challenge the traditional medical views on assessment of health and disease.
Family Practice,,,[Research training for all physicians--also outside university hospitals. Evaluation of a course in basic research methods]. General practitioners are often interested in doing research but are hampered by lack of time and research training. Interpreting the results of others can also be difficult. For this reason a course in basic research methods for GPs was started in Sweden in 1989. It was originally aimed at GPs but was later extended to hospital physicians as well. The course is given regionally and at present is held in six different locations in southern Sweden as well as in Hillerød  Denmark. The aim of this study is to evaluate the course as part of a research project to recommend changes to the courses in accordance with the course evaluations. The course consists of theory (lectures/seminars six hours a month) and practice (project work) over a period of 18 months. Questionnaires were mailed to the 112 physicians who  starting in 1997 and 1999  completed the course. Eighty-five percent responded to the questionnaire  which asked if the course goals were relevant and if they thought they had achieved them. The most frequent reasons given for attending the course were a desire to learn how to read scientific articles critically and how to carry out one's own research projects. Two thirds of the participants thought that the theoretical lectures and project work had supplemented each other well. Most of the participants thought that the goals were very relevant but fewer--between 57% and 77%--felt those goals had been achieved. The course provides important empirical information with regard to future specialist training in Denmark. The plan is for all physicians to have research training--amounting to a total of 60 days--with lectures in research methodology and tutored research projects. The Danish College of General Practitioners has planned research training in accordance with the experience from these courses.
Family Practice,,,[Dialogues on risks and health resources in general practice]. The healing and preventive forces related to individuals' health resources and self-assessed knowledge have hitherto been underestimated in medicine. In this article  we draw attention to ethical and epistemological challenges in relation to values  communication  knowledge  and autonomy that are embedded in the prevailing risk-oriented epidemiology. We have developed a theoretical model for a patient-centered  salutogenetic approach with the aim of a better balance between health resources and risk factors. We briefly present results of dialogues in the general practice consultation based on key questions about self-assessed health resources. We discuss pitfalls related to causality  group-based probabilities  medicalization  and informed consent  focusing on the clinical encounter with the individual patient. By introducing a salutogenetic perspective  we hope to shift attention towards the patient's resources and strengths. Communication can mediate oppression as well as empowerment.
Public Health,,,Costs of medically assisted reproduction treatment at specialized fertility clinics in the Danish public health care system: results from a 5-year follow-up cohort study. To examine the costs to the public health care system of couples in medically assisted reproduction. Longitudinal cohort study of infertile couples initiating medically assisted reproduction treatment. Specialized public fertility clinics in Denmark. Seven hundred and thirty-nine couples having no child at study entry and with data on kind of treatment and live birth (yes/no) for each treatment attempt at the specialized public fertility clinic. Treatment data for medically assisted reproduction attempts conducted at the public fertility clinics were abstracted from medical records. Flow diagrams were drawn for different standard treatment cycles and direct costs at each stage in the flow charts were measured and valued by a bottom-up procedure. Indirect costs were distributed to each treatment cycle on the basis of number of visits as basis. Costs were adjusted to 2012 prices using a constructed medical price index. Live birth  costs. Total costs per live birth in 2012 prices were estimated to 10 755€. Costs per treated couple - irrespective of whether the treatment was terminated by a live birth or not - were estimated at 6607€. Costs per live birth of women <35 years at treatment initiation were 9338€ and 15 040€ for women ≥35 years. The public costs for live births after conception with medically assisted reproduction treatment are relatively modest. The results can be generalized to public fertility treatment in Denmark and to other public treatment settings with similar limitations in numbers of public treatment cycles offered.
Molecular Epidemiology,,,Molecular Typing of Treponema pallidum in Denmark: A Nationwide Study of Syphilis. The aim of this nationwide study is to determine the strain type diversity among patients diagnosed with syphilis by PCR during a 4-year period in Denmark. Epidemiological data  including HIV status  for all patients were obtained from the Danish national syphilis registration system. Molecular strain typing was based on characterization of 3 variable treponemal genes  arp  tpr and tp0548. A total of 278 specimens from 269 patients were included. Among the fully typeable specimens (n = 197)  22 strain types were identified  with 1 type  14d/g  accounting for 54%. The majority (93%) of the patients reported acquiring syphilis in Denmark. Among patients with concurrent HIV  9 full strain types were identified and no difference in strain type was found by HIV status (p = 0.197). In conclusion  the majority of patients were infected in Denmark and the HIV-infected syphilis patients were diagnosed with a wide spectrum of different strain types of Treponema pallidum.
Forensic Genetics,,,Comparison of five DNA quantification methods. Six commercial preparations of human genomic DNA were quantified using five quantification methods: UV spectrometry  SYBR-Green dye staining  slot blot hybridization with the probe D17Z1  Quantifiler Human DNA Quantification kit and RB1 rt-PCR. All methods measured higher DNA concentrations than expected based on the information by the manufacturers. UV spectrometry  SYBR-Green dye staining  slot blot and RB1 rt-PCR gave 39  27  11 and 12%  respectively  higher concentrations than expected based on the manufacturers' information. The DNA preparations were quantified using the Quantifiler Human DNA Quantification kit in two experiments. The measured DNA concentrations with Quantifiler were 125 and 160% higher than expected based on the manufacturers' information. When the Quantifiler human DNA standard (Raji cell line) was replaced by the commercial human DNA preparation G147A (Promega) to generate the DNA standard curve in the Quantifiler Human DNA Quantification kit  the DNA quantification results of the human DNA preparations were 31% higher than expected based on the manufacturers' information. The results indicate a calibration problem with the Quantifiler human DNA standard for its use with the Quantifiler Human DNA Quantification kit. The possible reasons for the problem are discussed and a solution is suggested. The results emphasise the need for standard reference DNA material and standard methods for DNA quantification.
Cardiology,,,Insights from a study by the ESC cardiologists of tomorrow nucleus: the junior cardiologists’ research reveals that the ESC is well regarded by young cardiologists but there is room for improving its appeal. This research was performed to provide data on the specific needs and expectations of junior cardiologists across Europe from a professional medical organization characterized by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC). The study was carried out using telephone interviews. The target respondents were based in a wide range of different locations within Europe and were identified by national groups of young cardiologists and trainees. A questionnaire was employed asking about information sources  membership of professional societies and related benefits. A total of 120 interviews were conducted. Websites and journals proved the most popular sources for professional information  consulted by .71 and 68% of respondents  respectively.With regard to the up to date best practice recommendations  guidelines documents were most common  mentioned by 63%. Overall  the ESC resources appeared within highest priority. The two main important tangible benefits expected from membership of professional societies were access to medical information  mostly journals and guidelines  and reduced financial congress requirements. Also  the most significant intangible benefit was networking. The ESC is widely respected by the junior cardiologists and trainees. Its congresses and guidelines are central to respondents’ image of it as a large  well arranged  important  and impressive organization. The ESC is a competently placed institution to further develop its relationship with young cardiologists.
General Practice,,,Resource allocation and the burden of co-morbidities among patients diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: an observational cohort study from Danish general practice. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a leading cause of mortality  and associated with increased healthcare utilization and healthcare expenditure. In several countries  morbidity-based systems have changed the way resources are allocated in general practice. In primary care  fee-for-services tariffs are often based on political negotiation rather than costing systems. The potential for comprehensive measures of patient morbidity to explain variation in negotiated expenditures for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has not previously been examined. The aim of this study is to analyze fee-for-service expenditure of patients diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease visiting Danish general practice clinics and further to assess what proportion of fee-for-service expenditure variation was explained by patient morbidity and general practice clinic characteristics  respectively. We used patient morbidity characteristics such as diagnostic markers and multi-morbidity adjustment based on adjusted clinical groups (ACGs) and fee-for-service expenditure for a sample of primary care patients for the year 2010. Our sample included 3 973 patients in 59 general practices. We used a multi-level approach. The average annual fee-for-service expenditure of caring for patients diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in general practice was about EUR 400 per patient. Variation in the expenditures was driven by multimorbidity characteristics up to 28% where as characteristics such as age and gender only explained 5%. Expenditures increased progressively with the degree of multimorbidity. In addition  expenditures were higher for patients who had diagnostic markers based on ICPC-2 (body systems and/or components such as infections and symptoms). Nevertheless  9.8-15.4% of the variation in expenditure was related to the clinic in which the patient was cared for. Patient morbidity and general practice clinic characteristics are significant patient-related fee-for-service expenditure drivers in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease care.
General Practice,,,Medical engagement and organizational characteristics in general practice. Medical engagement is a mutual concept of the active and positive contribution of doctors to maintaining and enhancing the performance of their health care organization  which itself recognizes this commitment in supporting and encouraging high quality care. A Medical Engagement Scale (MES) was developed by Applied Research Ltd (2008) on the basis of emerging evidence that medical engagement is critical for implementing radical improvements. To study the importance of medical engagement in general practice and to analyse patterns of association with individual and organizational characteristics. A cross-sectional study using a sampled survey questionnaire and the official register from the Danish General Practitioners' Organization comprising all registered Danish GPs. The Danish version of the MES Questionnaire was distributed and the survey results were analysed in conjunction with the GP register data. Statistically adjusted analyses revealed that the GPs' medical engagement varied substantially. GPs working in collaboration with colleagues were more engaged than GPs from single-handed practices  older GPs were less engaged than younger GPs and female GPs had higher medical engagement than their male colleagues. Furthermore  GPs participating in vocational training of junior doctors were more engaged than GPs not participating in vocational training. Medical engagement in general practice varies a great deal and this is determined by a complex interaction between both individual and organizational characteristics. Working in collaboration  having staff and being engaged in vocational training of junior doctors are all associated with enhanced levels of medical engagement among GPs.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Do antipsychotic drugs during pregnancy affect the unborn baby?]. Treatment with antipsychotic drugs has resulted in an increased number of well-treated patients who--like healthy women--wish to become pregnant. Studies of the effect of these drugs on the unborn child are few  and this puts the treating physician in a dilemma of choosing the right treatment. The present study reviews the existing literature on the ten most sold antipsychotic drugs in Denmark focusing on study design  number of exposed women and risks for the unborn child. Only few studies of the antipsychotic drugs in question are available  and these studies have not shown any significant risk of teratogenicity. Use of antipsychotic drugs should  however  be avoided during the first 3 months of pregnancy. If this is not possible  it is recommended to use the lowest dose possible for as short a period as possible. In addition  an obstetrician should follow the pregnant woman very closely  and the pregnant woman should give birth in a department with close contact to neonatal expertise.
General Practice,,,Quality of type 2 diabetes management in general practice is associated with involvement of general practice nurses. To assess whether involvement of general practice nurses in type 2 diabetes care in Danish general practice is associated with improved adherence to national guidelines on regular type 2 diabetes monitoring  and with lower HbA1c and cholesterol levels in the type 2 diabetes population. The study was an observational study soliciting questionnaire data from 193 Danish general practices and register data on 12 960 patients with type 2 diabetes (age range 40-80 years) from a diabetes database and a laboratory database. Clustering was addressed in the analyses. Practices with well-implemented nurse-led type 2 diabetes consultations and practices with no nurse(s) employed differed according to the mean proportions of patients whose HbA1c was measured (6.4%-points: 95% CI: 1.5 to 11.4)  and the mean proportions of patients whose HbA1c was ≥ 8% (-3.7%-points: 95% CI: -6.7 to -0.6). Small non-significant differences were found in the cholesterol analyses. Compared with practices with no nurse(s) employed  the quality of diabetes management was generally higher in terms of that HbA1c was measured according to the guidelines in a larger proportion of the diabetes population and the proportion of patients with an HbA1c level ≥ 8% was lower in practices with well-implemented nurse-led type 2 diabetes consultations.
Family Practice,,,The effect of feedback to general practitioners on quality of care for people with type 2 diabetes. A systematic review of the literature. There have been numerous efforts to improve and assure the quality of treatment and follow-up of people with Type 2 diabetes (PT2D) in general practice. Facilitated by the increasing usability and validity of guidelines  indicators and databases  feedback on diabetes care is a promising tool in this aspect. Our goal was to assess the effect of feedback to general practitioners (GPs) on the quality of care for PT2D based on the available literature. Systematic review searches were conducted using October 2008 updates of Medline (Pubmed)  Cochrane library and Embase databases. Additional searches in reference lists and related articles were conducted. Papers were included if published in English  performed as randomized controlled trials  studying diabetes  having general practice as setting and using feedback to GPs on diabetes care. The papers were assessed according to predefined criteria. Ten studies complied with the inclusion criteria. Feedback improved the care for PT2D  particularly process outcomes such as foot exams  eye exams and Hba1c measurements. Clinical outcomes like lowering of blood pressure  Hba1c and cholesterol levels were seen in few studies. Many process and outcome measures did not improve  while none deteriorated. Meta analysis was unfeasible due to heterogeneity of the studies included. Two studies used electronic feedback. Based on this review  feedback seems a promising tool for quality improvement in diabetes care  but more research is needed  especially of electronic feedback.
Family Practice,,,A follow-up study of the occurrence and consequences of HbA1c measurements in an unselected cohort of non-pharmacologically treated patients with Type 2 diabetes. To describe the occurrence of HbA1c measurements among non-pharmacologically treated diabetes patients  and to evaluate whether poor blood glucose regulation (HbA1c >8%) prompted intensification of treatment. Data from the National Health Service Registry  the Regional Laboratory Database and the Danish National Hospital Registry were collected from 2002 to 2004 to identify and describe all Type 2 diabetic patients above 40 years of age in a background population of nearly 660 000 citizens in Aarhus County  corresponding to 12% of the total Danish population. A total of 1989 had at least one HbA1c measurement  whereas 484 (20%) had no HbA1c measurement at all in 2003. Most patients had an HbA1c of less than 8%  and for 820 (41%) HbA1c was less than 6.5%  but for 316 (16%) patients  the first HbA1c measurement in 2003 was above 8%. After 6 months  patients with HbA1c above 8% had a higher probability of initiating pharmacological treatment (M; 0.64; 95% CI 0.58-0.70) (F; 0.68; 95% CI 0.58-0.77) than patients with HbA1c below 8% (M; 0.12; 95% CI 0.10-0.14) (F; 0.11; 95% CI 0.09-0.14). This study indicates that poor blood glucose regulation (HbA1c >8%) prompted a shift from non-pharmacological treatment to pharmacological treatment for most patients. However  a substantial group of patients are either not monitored on a regular basis or  if monitored  their elevated measurements of HbA1c do not prompt initiation of pharmacological treatment.
Family Practice,,,[Validation of methods to identify known diabetes on the basis of health registers]. In 2003 the government introduced a national diabetes plan. One of the recommendations was to establish a national diabetes database targeted at monitoring the prevalence of diabetes and quality of diabetes care. The aim of this study is to validate a national algorithm for identification of known diabetes and compare the results with the results from the use of a regional algorithm. Patients with diabetes residing in Aarhus County on 31 December 2003 were identified by data from The National Patient Registry  The National Health Insurance Service Registry  the prescription database and the laboratory database in the county. This study identified a total of 8 802 patients with a diagnosis of diabetes which was confirmed by the patients' general practitioners (GP). This corresponds to a prevalence of 2.32% (95% CI: 2.27%2.37%). The national algorithm found 86% of this diabetes population while the regional algorithm found 96%. The sensitivity was increased to 91% by supplementing with information of dispensed prescriptions for anti-diabetics in the national algorithm. The positive predictive value was 89% for the national algorithm as well as for the regional algorithm. The national algorithm may be used as a tool for establishing a national diabetes database. Despite a higher sensitivity  the regional algorithm cannot currently be recommended at a national level as it depends on the collection of person-related data which are not available nationally at the present time.
Family Practice,,,Routine screening for diabetic eye complications in a population based cohort of 4.438 persons with type 2 diabetes in a Danish county. This study aims to describe the use of routine screening for diabetic eye complications in a large population based cohort of type 2 diabetic patients in the County of Vejle  Denmark. Furthermore  it aims to identify characteristics of patients and general practitioners related to the frequency of eye examinations. The type 2 diabetic population alive and resident in the County of Vejle on 1st January 1997. Data concerning eye examinations were collected from public data files for the period of January 1993 to December 1997. In a population of 4438 type 2 diabetic patients  46% had had one annual eye examination in 1997 and 26% had not had a single eye examination within the last five years. Patient characteristics related to an eye examination included: treatment with insulin or oral hypoglycaemic agents  females and long duration of diabetes. The number of diabetic patients who had had an eye examination varied substantially between the general practices. The characteristics of general practitioners were not related to this variation. The results of this study indicate a great need for quality improvement of ophthalmologic service in diabetes care. To achieve this improvement  more focus should be given to cooperation between the general practitioners and the ophthalmologists.
Critical Care Nursing,,,Shift work and quality of sleep: effect of working in designed dynamic light. To examine the effect of designed dynamic light on staff's quality of sleep with regard to sleep efficiency  level of melatonin in saliva  and subjective perceptions of quality of sleep. An intervention group working in designed dynamic light was compared with a control group working in ordinary institutional light at two comparable intensive care units (ICUs). The study included examining (1) melatonin profiles obtained from saliva samples  (2) quality of sleep in terms of sleep efficiency  number of awakenings and subjective assessment of sleep through the use of sleep monitors and sleep diaries  and (3) subjective perceptions of well-being  health  and sleep quality using a questionnaire. Light conditions were measured at both locations. A total of 113 nurses (88 %) participated. There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding personal characteristics  and no significant differences in total sleep efficiency or melatonin level were found. The intervention group felt more rested (OR 2.03  p = 0.003) and assessed their condition on awakening as better than the control group (OR 2.35  p = 0.001). Intervention-ICU nurses received far more light both during day and evening shifts compared to the control-ICU. The study found no significant differences in monitored sleep efficiency and melatonin level. Nurses from the intervention-ICU subjectively assessed their sleep as more effective than participants from the control-ICU.
Neurology,,,Nikolai V. Konovalov (1900-1966): his role in the development of neurology and the creation of the Institute of Neurology of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences. Nikolai V. Konovalov (1900-1966) has left a significant imprint in the history of Russian neuroscience. He was among the coryphaei of international and national neurology. Along with the large number of fundamental scientific papers that have determined several aspects of the development of neuroscience  his contribution has been equally important to the establishment and development of one of the distinguished Russian scientific centers - the Institute of Neurology of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences  which he headed from 1948 until 1966.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Report of the Croatian Society for Neurovascular Disorders  Croatian Medical Association. Evidence based guidelines for treatment of primary headaches--2012 update. These guidelines have been developed to assist the physician in making appropriate choices in work-up and treatment of patients with headaches. The specific aim of the Evidence Based Guidelines for Treatment of Primary Headaches--2012 Update is to provide recommendations for establishing an accurate diagnosis and choose the most appropriate therapy in the group of patients with primary headaches  based on a comprehensive review and meta-analysis of scientific evidence with regard to treatment possibilities in Croatia. These data are based on our previous Evidence Based Guidelines for Treatment of Primary Headaches published in 2005 and other recommendations and guidelines for headache treatment.
Topography  Medical,,,Incidence of childhood central nervous system tumors in the Nordic countries. The incidence rates of childhood central nervous system (CNS) tumors in the Nordic countries remain among the highest in the world. Large geographical and temporal variations in the incidence rates of CNS tumors have been reported. Increasing incidence rates would be a public health concern  as they might indicate increased exposure to environmental risk factors. All 3 983 children 0-14 years of age registered with a primary CNS tumor in 1985-2006 in the national cancer registries of the Denmark  Finland  Norway  and Sweden were identified. Tumors were classified according to the International Classification of Childhood Cancer version 3 (ICCC-3). Join-point analysis was used to detect changes in trends and to estimate annual changes in incidence rates. The mean annual incidence rate of CNS tumors was 42 per million. No statistically significant change in time trends of incidence rates was observed during 1985-2006. Furthermore  the incidence by birth cohort was relatively stable during the study period. The incidence rates of childhood CNS tumors in the Nordic countries remain among the highest in the world. The stable incidence rates during the last 22 years indicate that major changes in environmental risk factors are unlikely.
General Practice,,,Polypharmacy in general practice. Polypharmacy increases the risk of side effects and interactions. We quantified the prevalence of major polypharmacy (MPP) in a Danish county with 236 000 inhabitants  invited general practitioners (GPs) to participate in a quality improvement project and discussed the medication of 10-20 MPP patients selected by the participating GPs. This was a prospective registry study of all prescriptions of subsidized drugs in the third quarter of 2005 for all inhabitants living in Roskilde County  Denmark. An audit was performed of the prescriptions of 220 MPP patients selected by the GPs based on a list of each MPP patient's medications. MPP patients constituted 2.1% of the county's population. GPs demonstrated a strong interest in auditing prescriptions. A large share of the patients selected by the GPs was treated with drugs which were no longer indicated  or with drugs with a doubtful indication. MPP compromises the GP's ability to manage medication of individual patients. Systematic audit of the total medication of patients should be introduced.
Family Practice,,,[Influencing the prescriptions of general practitioners via guidelines and feedback--secondary publication]. We investigated the effects of a multi-dimensional intervention on practice prescription patterns in five drug groups. The number of prescribed defined daily doses (DDDs) increased after the intervention  while potential savings/DDD decreased. The county's average cost/DDD fell to a level below the national average. It is possible to change general practitioners' prescription patterns without interfering with their clinical freedom or patients' access to treatment.
Radiology,,,Radiographic development during three decades in a patient with psoriatic arthritis mutilans. Psoriatic arthritis mutilans (PAM) is the most severe and rare form of psoriatic arthritis (PsA). We describe radiological development in a typical case of PAM covering three decades in order to elucidate the need for early diagnosis of PAM. Radiographs of hands and feet  taken from 1981 to 2010  were evaluated using the Psoriatic Arthritis Ratingen Score (PARS). When PsA was diagnosed  in 1981  gross deformity was observed in the second PIP joint of the left foot. Several pencil-in-cup deformities and gross osteolysis were present in the feet in the first decade of the disease. Over 10 years  many joints had reached maximum scores. During the follow-up  other joints became involved and the disease developed clinically. Reporting early signs suggestive of PAM  e.g. pencil-in cup deformities and gross osteolysis in any joint  should be mandatory and crucial. This would heighten our awareness of PAM  accelerate the diagnosis  and lead to improved effective treatment in order to minimize joint damages resulting in PAM.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,CanVasc Recommendations for the Management of Antineutrophil Cytoplasm Antibody-associated Vasculitides. The Canadian Vasculitis research network (CanVasc) is composed of physicians from different medical specialties and researchers with expertise in vasculitis. One of its aims is to develop recommendations for the diagnosis and management of antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAV) in Canada. Diagnostic and therapeutic questions were developed based on the results of a national needs assessment survey. A systematic review of existing non-Canadian recommendations and guidelines for the diagnosis and management of AAV and studies of AAV published after the 2009 European League Against Rheumatism/European Vasculitis Society recommendations (publication date: January 2009) until November 2014 was performed in the Medline database  Cochrane library  and main vasculitis conference proceedings. Quality of supporting evidence for each therapeutic recommendation was graded. The full working group as well as additional reviewers  including patients  reviewed the developed therapeutic recommendations and nontherapeutic statements using a modified 2-step Delphi technique and through discussion to reach consensus. Nineteen recommendations and 17 statements addressing general AAV diagnosis and management were developed  as well as appendices for practical use  for rheumatologists  nephrologists  respirologists  general internists  and all other healthcare professionals more occasionally involved in the management of patients with AAV in community and academic practice settings. These recommendations were developed based on a synthesis of existing international guidelines  other published supporting evidence  and expert consensus considering the Canadian healthcare context  with the intention of promoting best practices and improving healthcare delivery for patients with AAV.
Epidemiology,,,Trends in prescription of biological agents and outcomes of juvenile idiopathic arthritis: results of the Dutch national Arthritis and Biologics in Children Register. Treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) has changed dramatically since the introduction of biological agents in 1999. To evaluate trends in prescription patterns of biological agents and the subsequent outcome of JIA. The Arthritis and Biologics in Children register (multicentre prospective observational study) aimed to include all consecutive patients with JIA in the Netherlands who had started biological agents since 1999. Patients were divided according to year of introduction of first biological agent. Patient characteristics at introduction of the first biological agent and its effectiveness were analysed over 12 years. 335 patients with non-systemic JIA and 86 patients with systemic JIA started a biological agent between 1999 and 2010. Etanercept remained the most often prescribed biological agent for non-systemic JIA; anakinra became first choice for systemic JIA. The use of systemic glucocorticoids and synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs before biological agents decreased. During these 12 years of observation  biological agents were prescribed earlier in the disease course and to patients with lower baseline JADAS (Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score) disease activity. All baseline disease activity parameters were lowered in patients with non-systemic JIA. In systemic JIA  prescription patterns changed towards very early introduction of biological agents (median 0.4 years of disease duration) in patients with a low number of joints with active arthritis and high erythrocyte sedimentation rates. These changes for both systemic and non-systemic JIA resulted in more patients with inactive disease after 3 and 15 months of treatment. Biological agents are increasingly prescribed  earlier in the disease and in patients with JIA with lower disease activity. These changes are accompanied by better short-term disease outcomes.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Juvenile idiopathic arthritis of the axial joints: a systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy and predictive value of conventional MRI. Our objective was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and reliability of MRI and its ability to depict responsiveness to treatment for the evaluation of the axial joints (temporomandibular joint [TMJ]  spinal joints  and sacroiliac joints) in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). There is fair (grade B) evidence that MRI is an accurate diagnostic method for evaluating early and intermediate changes in the TMJ in JIA and insufficient evidence to indicate MRI is an accurate diagnostic method for detecting JIA in the spinal (grade I) and sacroiliac (grade I) joints.
Epidemiology,,,Autoimmune diseases in Adult Life after Childhood Cancer in Scandinavia (ALiCCS). The pattern of autoimmune diseases in childhood cancer survivors has not been investigated previously. We estimated the risk for an autoimmune disease after childhood cancer in a large  population-based setting with outcome measures from comprehensive  nationwide health registries. From the national cancer registries of Denmark  Iceland and Sweden  we identified 20 361 1-year survivors of cancer diagnosed before the age of 20 between the start of cancer registration in the 1940s and 1950s through 2008; 125 794 comparison subjects  matched by age  gender and country  were selected from national population registers. Study subjects were linked to the national hospital registers. Standardised hospitalisation rate ratios (SHRRs) and absolute excess risks (AERs) were calculated. Childhood cancer survivors had a significantly increased SHRR of 1.4 (95% CI 1.3 to 1.5) of all autoimmune diseases combined  corresponding to an AER of 67 per 100 000 person-years. The SHRRs were significantly increased for autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (16.3)  Addison's disease (13.9)  polyarteritis nodosa (5.8)  chronic rheumatic heart disease (4.5)  localised scleroderma (3.6)  idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (3.4)  Hashimoto's thyroiditis (3.1)  pernicious anaemia (2.7)  sarcoidosis (2.2)  Sjögren's syndrome (2.0) and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (1.6). The SHRRs for any autoimmune disease were significantly increased after leukaemia (SHRR 1.6)  Hodgkin's lymphoma (1.6)  renal tumours (1.6) and central nervous system neoplasms (1.4). Childhood cancer survivors are at increased risk for certain types of autoimmune diseases. These findings underscore the need for prolonged follow-up of these survivors.
Medical Oncology,Pediatrics,,Collaborative Research in Childhood Cancer Survivorship: The Current Landscape. Survivors of childhood cancer carry a substantial burden of morbidity and are at increased risk for premature death. Furthermore  clear associations exist between specific therapeutic exposures and the risk for a variety of long-term complications. The entire landscape of health issues encountered for decades after successful completion of treatment is currently being explored in various collaborative research settings. These settings include large population-based or multi-institutional cohorts and single-institution studies. The ascertainment of outcomes has depended on self-reporting  linkage to registries  or clinical assessments. Survivorship research in the cooperative group setting  such as the Children's Oncology Group  has leveraged the clinical trials infrastructure to explore the molecular underpinnings of treatment-related adverse events  and to understand specific complications in the setting of randomized risk-reduction strategies. This review highlights the salient findings from these large collaborative initiatives  emphasizing the need for life-long follow-up of survivors of childhood cancer  and describing the development of several guidelines and efforts toward harmonization. Finally  the review reinforces the need to identify populations at highest risk  facilitating the development of risk prediction models that would allow for targeted interventions across the entire trajectory of survivorship.
Community Health Nursing,General Practice,,Who is the key worker in palliative home care? Palliative home care involves coordination of care between the professionals involved. The NICE guideline on supportive and palliative care (UK) recommends that teams  regardless of their base  should promote continuity for patients. This may involve nomination of a coordinating "key worker". This study aimed to explore who acts as key worker and who ought to take on this role in the views of patients  relatives  and primary care professionals. Furthermore  it aimed to explore the level of agreement on this issue between study participants. Interview and questionnaire study. Former County of Aarhus  Denmark (2008-2009). Ninety-six terminally ill cancer patients  their relatives  general practitioners (GPs)  and community nurses (CNs). Actual key worker as valued by patients  relatives  and primary care professionals; ideal key worker as valued by patients and relatives. RESULTS. Patients  relatives  GPs  and CNs most often saw themselves as having been the key worker. When asked about the ideal key worker  most patients (29%; 95%CI: 18;42) and relatives (32%; 95%CI: 22;45) pointed to the GP. Using patients' views as reference  we found very limited agreement with relatives (47.7%; k = 0.05)  with GPs (30.4%; k = 0.01) and with CNs (25.0%; k = 0.04). Agreement between patients and relatives on the identity of the ideal key worker was of a similar dimension (29.6%; k = 0.11). Poor agreement between patients  relatives  and professionals on actual and ideal key worker emphasizes the need for matching expectations and clear communication about task distribution in palliative home care.
Family Practice,,,[Palliation in the primary care sector--shared care]. Palliative homecare has been a primary care task for a long time. The introduction of palliative specialist teams has given patients with severe symptoms the possibility of getting qualified help  but has also resulted in a general tendency to exclude primary care from palliative care. Barriers to providing shared care are the organization of palliative care and the working culture of health professionals. Increased focus on shared care research is needed in order to optimise palliative home care.
General Practice,,,Direct-access to abdominal ultrasonic investigation from general practice—the role in earlier cancer diagnosis. Abdominal ultrasound (US) is a safe and low-cost diagnostic tool for various abdominal symptoms. Direct-access to US from general practice has been suggested as a feasible option to promote earlier cancer diagnosis because abdominal cancer often presents with non-specific and vague symptoms  and the exact location may be difficult to identify on the basis of symptoms alone. To describe patterns of use and cancer prevalence in referred patients when providing Danish GPs with direct-access to hospital-based US. In an observational study  GPs were given the opportunity to either refer patients directly to US or through a waiting-list at Vejle Regional Hospital in Denmark; 701 patients were included between 1 August 2009 and 31 January 2010. Data were retrieved from the local Radiology Information System  GP referrals and the Danish Cancer Registry. GPs referred 60% of all patients to direct-access US. Cancer was diagnosed in 19 (2.7%) of the referred patients within 6 months after the US investigation. US gave rise to the suspicion of cancer in 11 of these patients (57.9%); 10 of these had been referred to direct-access US. At least one non-malignant diagnosis resulted from US in 59.5% of the cases  while 37.8% of the cases had no final diagnosis. The findings in this study might indicate that GPs refer patients assessed to have a higher risk of cancer through direct-access US. The finding was statistically non-significant  and further research is required to confirm this result.
General Practice,,,Predictive values of GPs' suspicion of serious disease: a population-based follow-up study. Knowledge is sparse on the prevalence of suspicion of cancer and other serious diseases in general practice. Likewise  little is known about the possible implications of this suspicion on future healthcare use and diagnoses. To study the prevalence of GPs' suspicions of cancer or other serious diseases and analyse how this suspicion predicted the patients' healthcare use and diagnoses of serious disease. Prospective population-based cohort study of 4518 patients consulting 404 GPs in a mix of urban  semi-urban and rural practices in Central Denmark Region during 2008-2009. The GPs registered consultations in 1 work day  including information on their suspicion of the presence of cancer or another serious disease. The patients were followed up for use of healthcare services and new diagnoses through the use of national registers. Prevalence of suspicion was 5.7%. Suspicion was associated with an increase in referrals (prevalence ratio [PR] = 2.56  95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.22 to 2.96)  especially for diagnostic imaging (PR = 3.95  95% CI = 2.80 to 5.57)  increased risk of a new diagnosis of cancer or another serious disease within 2 months (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.98  95% CI = 1.93 to 4.62)--especially for cancer (HR = 7.55  95% CI = 2.66 to 21.39)--and increased use of general practice (relative risk [RR] = 1.14  95% CI = 1.06 to 1.24) and hospital visits (RR = 1.90  95% CI = 1.62 to 2.23). The positive predictive value of a GP suspicion was 9.8% (95% CI = 6.4 to 14.1) for cancer or another serious disease within 2 months. A GP suspicion of serious disease warrants further investigation  and the organisation of the healthcare system should ensure direct access from the primary sector to specialised tests.
Nephrology,,,The outcome of antenatal ultrasound diagnosed anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract in a large Danish birth cohort. Antenatal ultrasound diagnosed anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (AUDAKUT) are reported in 0.3%-5% on prenatal ultrasound (US) and 0.3%-4.5% on postnatal US. The anterior-posterior diameter of the renal pelvis (APD) is an essential measurement. Series with low threshold values of APD prenatally and postnatally will include healthy infants. It is important to avoid follow-up of such infants. In 2006  new Danish guidelines for AUDAKUT were introduced. Investigations of incidences and type of AUDAKUT based on Danish guidelines  including long-term follow-up. Cohort study. Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre and Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet  Denmark. Consecutive cases with AUDAKUT in the second and third trimesters  which were either terminated before 22 completed weeks of gestation or born in the 8-year period January 2006-December 2013. Patients were followed until June 2014. 50 193 live born children and 24 terminated fetuses (0.05%) were included. The prevalence of AUDAKUT was only 0.39% prenatally  0.29% at first postnatal US and 0.22% at the end of follow-up  including terminated cases. The greater the prenatal and postnatal APD  the higher risk of febrile urinary tract infection (fUTI) and surgical intervention  and lower probability of resolution. 25% of the identified patients had fUTI and/or surgery. We recommend threshold values of APD at least 10 mm in the third trimester and in general at least 12 mm at first postnatal US for intensive follow-up. In this largest to date unselected birth cohort of AUDAKUT  the incidences of clinically significant AUDAKUT were in the lowest range of those previously published.
Forensic Pathology,,,Intramuscular injection of "site enhancement oil": forensic considerations. The use of intramuscular injection of foreign substances for aesthetic purposes is well known. Complications are usually local to the site of injection but can be potentially lethal. Here  we present a case of "site enhancement oil" use in a 42-year-old man who died from asphyxia due to hanging. Macroscopic and microscopic changes as well as computed tomographic changes in injected musculature are described and the potentially lethal adverse effects after site enhancement oil use are warranted.
Forensic Pathology,,,Is acute alveolar dilation an indicator of strangulation homicide? Some cases of suspected homicidal strangulation are difficult to diagnose if the classical injuries of strangulation are few or lacking. The main purpose of this study was to determine if abnormal distension of alveolar airspaces is present in strangulation deaths and whether or not it can be used to support this diagnosis. Another purpose was to see how often the gross examination of the lungs was in agreement with the microscopic examination. The material comprised 33 victims of homicidal strangulation above the age of 15 years  autopsied at the Department of Forensic Medicine in Copenhagen between 1998 and 2007. The results were compared with a control group of the same size  matched for gender and age  all of whom died naturally of cerebral or other neurological causes. The autopsy reports provided the results of the gross examination of the lungs. Regular haematoxylin-eosin stained sections were made from the histological specimens. The microscopic examination was performed by computerized image analysis using stereological methods in an attempt to objectify the observations. The results showed an almost complete concordance between the findings of the gross and the microscopic examination. Stereologically the study showed that the alveoli in the strangulation cases were twice the size of those in the control group which was highly statistically significant concluding that abnormal distension of alveolar airspaces.
Forensic Pathology,,,Left paraduodenal hernia: an autopsy case. We present a case of a left paraduodenal hernia diagnosed at autopsy. A left paraduodenal hernia is an internal hernia of congenital origin due to the abnormal rotation of the midgut during embryonic development. Internal hernias are a rare cause of intestinal obstruction  with the paraduodenal being the most frequent. The clinical course can be asymptomatic  cause chronic or intermittent abdominal pain  or present with acute abdomen. The clinical entity is a diagnostic challenge  which is illustrated in the present case where there patient died during hospital admission. The case also emphasizes the difficulty in diagnosing the disease by plain abdominal radiography.
Dermatology,Evidence-Based Medicine,,Guidelines for diagnosis  prevention and treatment of hand eczema. The guidelines aim to provide advice on the management of hand eczema (HE)  using an evidence- and consensus-based approach. The guidelines consider a systematic Cochrane review on interventions for HE  which is based on a systematic search of the published literature (including hand-searching). In addition to the evidence- and consensus-based recommendation on the treatment of HE  the guidelines cover mainly consensus-based diagnostic aspects and preventive measures (primary and secondary prevention). Treatment recommendations include non-pharmacological interventions  topical  physical and systemic treatments. Topical corticosteroids are recommended as first line treatment in the management of HE  however continuous long-term treatment beyond six weeks only when necessary and under careful me-dical supervision. Alitretinoin is recommended as a second line treatment (relative to topical corticosteroids) for patients with severe chronic HE. Randomized control trials (RCT) are missing for other used systemic treatments and comparison of systemic drugs in “head-to-head” RCTs are needed.The guidelines development group is a working group of the European Society of Contact Dermatitis (ESCD) and has carefully tried to reconcile opposite views  define current optimal practice and provide specific recommendations  and meetings have been chaired by a professional moderator of the AWMF (Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Wis-senschaftlichen Medizinischen Fachgesellschaften; Association of the Scientific Medi-cal Societies in Germany).No financial support was given by any medical company. The guidelines are expected to be valid until December 2017 at the latest.

Anesthesiology,,,[What is intensive care medicine? Multidisciplinary intensive care units]. Intensive care medicine is described from a multidisciplinary point of view. The term "multidisciplinary" is used  although "multispeciality" may be more appropriate. Intensive care medicine is defined as an observational  diagnostical and therapeutical approach to the critically-ill patient  requiring specialized medical and nursing skills that cannot be met in a general ward. Critical illness is considered as overt or threatening  potentially reversible severe organ dysfunction. Intensive care medicine is conducted in the high-technology environment of intensive care units. These are further classified according to their own competency base as well as the level of the hospital in which they are situated.
Stroke Rehabilitation,,,Action research in rehabilitation with chronic stroke recovery: A case report with a focus on neural plasticity. Chronic stroke patients are primarily referred to general rehabilitation  rather than to specific neurorehabilitation. Currently  there are no Danish clinical guidelines for chronic stroke  but recent research in neuroplasticity has contributed to possible rehabilitation interventions for these patients. The purpose of this project is to describe the use of a specialized neuroplastic approach in combination with an already existing training program. The project is designed as an action research project concerning four participants with chronic stroke. Through ten intervention  a neuroplastic focus has been added to their group training program including daily home training. Participants were tested before and after the intervention with MAS  DGI  6MWT  SSQLS. All four participants improved their functional levels and their quality of life following the intervention. This report indicates that a specific neuroplastic focus in combination with action research has an impact on the participants with chronic stroke. However  there is still no clarity regarding what type of rehabilitation methods can be considered the most efficacious in promoting neuroplasticity. This case report serves as a pilot project for further studies of how to implement neuroplasticity in physical therapy.
Stroke Rehabilitation,Rehabilitation,,Electromyographic Comparison of Elastic Resistance and Machine Exercises for High-Intensity Strength Training in Patients With Chronic Stroke. To investigate whether elastic resistance training can induce comparable levels of muscle activity as conventional machine training in patients with chronic stroke. Comparative study. Outpatient rehabilitation facility. Stroke patients (N=18) with hemiparesis (mean age  57 ± 8y). Patients performed 3 consecutive repetitions at 10 repetition maximum of unilateral knee extension and flexion using elastic resistance and conventional machine training. Surface electromyography was measured in vastus lateralis  vastus medialis  biceps femoris  and semitendinosus and was normalized to maximal electromyography (% of max) of the nonparetic leg. In the paretic leg  agonist muscle activity ranged from 18% to 24% normalized electromyography (% of max) (nEMG) during knee flexion and from 32% to 40% nEMG during knee extension. For knee extension  vastus lateralis nEMG was higher during machine exercise than during elastic resistance exercise (40% [95% confidence interval {CI}  33-47] vs 32% [95% CI  25-39]; P=.003). In the nonparetic leg  agonist muscle activity ranged from 54% to 61% during knee flexion and from 52% to 68% during knee extension. For knee flexion semitendinosus nEMG was higher (61% [95% CI  50-71] vs 54% [95% CI  44-64]; P=.016) and for knee extension vastus medialis nEMG was higher (68% [95% CI  60-76] vs 56% [95% CI  48-64]; P<.001) during machine exercise than during elastic resistance exercise. By contrast  antagonist coactivation was significantly higher during knee flexion when performed using elastic resistance compared with the machine. Lastly  there were no differences in perceived exertion between exercise modalities. Machine training appears to induce slightly higher levels of muscle activity in some of the investigated muscles compared to elastic resistance during lower limb strength training in patients with chronic stroke. The higher level of coactivation during knee flexion when performed using elastic resistance suggests that elastic resistance exercises are more difficult to perform. This is likely due to a higher level of movement instability.
Stroke Rehabilitation,,,Posturographic description of the regaining of postural stability following stroke. Failing balance and increased liability to falling are common complaints among hemiplegic subjects. During rehabilitation much effort is put into regaining postural stability. To describe the regaining of postural stability during rehabilitation for the first year following stroke in hemiplegic patients Twenty-six patients were included within 5 days of suffering a stroke resulting from a CT-verified clearly defined thromboembolic lesion  localized in the vascular bed of middle cerebral artery on either side. Posturographic evaluation of sway was performed on a commercially available force plate system (Balance Master Pro). Measured parameters included per cent maximum stability (PMS)  per cent ankle strategy (AST)  and average angular velocity (AVE). An additional parameter was derived by calculating the slope (SLP) of the linear relationship between stability and ankle strategy. SLP reflects the predisposition of the stroke patient to keep using ankle strategy when faced with increasingly difficult balance tasks. The presence of familiarization to the measurement method was examined by including a preliminary measurement not otherwise included in the analysis of changes during the first year of follow-up. The temporal evolvement of sway was described by measuring sway parameters 1  2  4  8 and 52 weeks following stroke. The proportions of the variation in sway caused by measurement error and between patients were compared. All parameters improved over time  as demonstrated by significant improvements from each of week 1  2  4 and 8 to week 52. There was evidence of familiarisation for PMS  AST and AVE  but not for SLP. Estimation of variance components showed that between patient variation accounts for between two-thirds and four-fifths of the total variation. A considerable part of this variation was caused by individual differences in the temporal improvement of sway over time. Patients considered the evaluation of postural sway demanding and time consuming resulting in a relatively large loss to follow-up: 15 patients completed the 8-week visit while seven completed the 1 year visit. Postural stability increases for the first year following stroke. There is evidence of familiarization towards the measurements process for the traditional posturographic parameters PMS  AST and AVE  but not for the derived parameter SLP  which might make the latter a candidate for a sway parameter reflecting basic mechanisms of upholding upright stance in hemiplegic patients. The estimated variance components stress the considerable between-patient variation and question the ability of the force plate method to monitor individual sway performance of such patients during the rehabilitation process.
Telemedicine,,,Telemedicine fighting acute coronary syndromes. Telemedicine allows exchange of information and has therefore become an important tool for optimizing patient treatment in the field of cardiology. Transmission of electrocardiograms (ECGs) from the prehospital setting to the receiving hospital is the most widespread technology in the prehospital setting. Providing a diagnostic ECG from patients with acute coronary syndromes to health care professionals with decision-making power has proven pivotal for an early diagnosis  ideal triage  and initiation of reperfusion therapy of the large group of patients presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). This urgent triage could be expanded to several diagnosis in cardiology  primarily the non-ST-elevation presenters. The purpose of the present article is to briefly describe the history the teletransmitted ECG and some of the recent results obtained when used in routine practice for acute triage and referral for primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Transmitting 12-lead ECGs from the community directly to attending cardiologists should become routine. Time to reperfusion in STEMI has decreased  explaining much of the observed decrease in STEMI mortality. This technology allows for increasingly complex and individualized prehospital medical care and could be expanded to a broader number of cardiovascular diagnoses.
Anesthesiology,,,[Physician-based prehospital units in Denmark]. With the reduction of administrative Regions in Denmark to a total of five  more focus has been given to prehospital services. Since access to and quality of prehospital treatment is not standardized  it may very well vary between regions. Information was collected from all existing physician-based units in Denmark through official sources and subsequently verified by direct contact to the administrative unit's prehospital organization. Data was collected in the period 1 December 2007 to 31 January 2008. There is great variation in coverage of Danish prehospital physician-based units. The number of dedicated prehospital units in significantly lower in Region North Jutland than in the remaining regions (measured as units pr. million inhabitants as well as is units per 10 000 square kilometers). Generally  the dedicated physician-based prehospital units are staffed with a specialist in anaesthesiology. There is considerable variation in the coverage of the physician-based prehospital units in Denmark. There are sound medical arguments for having a specialist in anaesthesiology staffing physician-based prehospital units. All administrative regions - except Region Nordjylland - offer advanced physician prehospital treatment on a 24-hours basis.
Telemedicine,,,Effect on treatment delay of prehospital teletransmission of 12-lead electrocardiogram to a cardiologist for immediate triage and direct referral of patients with ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction to primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Prehospital electrocardiogram (ECG) transmission to hospitals was shown to reduce time to treatment in patients with acute myocardial infarction. However  new technologies allow transmission directly to a mobile unit so an attending physician can respond irrespective of presence within or outside the hospital. The primary study purpose was to determine whether delays could be decreased in an urban area by transmitting a prehospital 12-lead ECG directly to the attending cardiologist's mobile telephone for rapid triage and transport to a primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) center  bypassing local hospitals and emergency departments. A secondary purpose was to describe whether transport would be safe despite longer transport times. During a 2-year period  patients with acute nontraumatic chest pain had their prehospital ECG transmitted directly to a cardiologist's mobile telephone. Time to treatment was compared with historic controls. After ECG evaluation  168 patients (30%) were referred directly for PCI  and 146 of these (87%) underwent emergent catheterization. In referred patients  median time from 911 call to PCI was significantly shorter than in the control group (74 vs 127 minutes; p <0.001). Accordingly  door-to-PCI time was 63 minutes shorter for referred patients versus controls (34 vs 97 minutes; p <0.001). During transport  7 patients (4%) experienced ventricular fibrillation; 3 patients (2%)  ventricular tachycardia; and 1 patient (0.5%)  pulseless electrical activity  including 2 deaths (1%) caused by treatment-resistant arrhythmia. In conclusion  transmission of a prehospital 12-lead ECG directly to the attending cardiologist's mobile telephone decreased door-to-PCI time by >1 hour when patients were transported directly to PCI centers  bypassing local hospitals. Ambulance transport seems safe despite longer transport times.
Epidemiology,,,High lung cancer surgical procedure volume is associated with shorter length of stay and lower risks of re-admission and death: National cohort analysis in England. It is debated whether treating cancer patients in high-volume surgical centres can lead to improvement in outcomes  such as shorter length of hospital stay  decreased frequency and severity of post-operative complications  decreased re-admission  and decreased mortality. The dataset for this analysis was based on cancer registration and hospital discharge data and comprised information on 15 738 non-small-cell lung cancer patients resident and diagnosed in England in 2006-2010 and treated by surgical resection. The number of lung cancer resections was computed for each hospital in each calendar year  and patients were assigned to a hospital volume quintile on the basis of the volume of their hospital. Hospitals with large lung cancer surgical resection volumes were less restrictive in their selection of patients for surgical management and provided a higher resection rate to their geographical population. Higher volume hospitals had shorter length of stay and the odds of re-admission were 15% lower in the highest hospital volume quintile compared with the lowest quintile. Mortality risks were 1% after 30 d and 3% after 90 d. Patients from hospitals in the highest volume quintile had about half the odds of death within 30 d than patients from the lowest quintile. Variations in outcomes were generally small  but in the same direction  with consistently better outcomes in the larger hospitals. This gives support to the ongoing trend towards centralisation of clinical services  but service re-organisation needs to take account of not only the size of hospitals but also referral routes and patient access.
General Practice,,,Use of the English urgent referral pathway for suspected cancer and mortality in patients with cancer: cohort study. To assess the overall effect of the English urgent referral pathway on cancer survival. 8049 general practices in England. Cohort study. Linked information from the national Cancer Waiting Times database  NHS Exeter database  and National Cancer Register was used to estimate mortality in patients in relation to the propensity of their general practice to use the urgent referral pathway. 215 284 patients with cancer  diagnosed or first treated in England in 2009 and followed up to 2013. Hazard ratios for death from any cause  as estimated from a Cox proportional hazards regression. During four years of follow-up  91 620 deaths occurred  of which 51 606 (56%) occurred within the first year after diagnosis. Two measures of the propensity to use urgent referral  the standardised referral ratio and the detection rate  were associated with reduced mortality. The hazard ratio for the combination of high referral ratio and high detection rate was 0.96 (95% confidence interval 0.94 to 0.99)  applying to 16% (n=34 758) of the study population. Patients with cancer who were registered with general practices with the lowest use of urgent referral had an excess mortality (hazard ratio 1.07 (95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.08); 37% (n=79 416) of the study population). The comparator group for these two hazard ratios was the remaining 47% (n=101 110) of the study population. This result in mortality was consistent for different types of cancer (apart from breast cancer) and with other stratifications of the dataset  and was not sensitive to adjustment for potential confounders and other details of the statistical model. Use of the urgent referral pathway could be efficacious. General practices that consistently have a low propensity to use urgent referrals could consider increasing the use of this pathway to improve the survival of their patients with cancer.
Pharmacoepidemiology,,,Danish trends in pharmacotherapy  comorbidities  and demographics in patients referred for coronary angiography: what changed during a decade? Coronary angiography holds a central role in the diagnosis of coronary heart disease. We studied temporal trends in referral patterns 2000-09. We identified 156 496 first-time coronary angiographies in 2000-09 in nationwide registries. Trends were analyzed in 2-year intervals. Numbers of acute (5943-10 707) and elective (17 294-25 550) procedures increased between 2000-01 and 2008-09. Mean age increased from 61.8 to 63.9 years (P < 0.001) and the proportion of females increased from 33 to 37% (P < 0.001). An increase in the number of patients with prior chronic heart failure (2866 vs. 3197)  cerebrovascular disease (1790 vs. 2906)  diabetes (2527 vs. 4593)  and arrhythmias (2985 vs. 4733) was observed. The proportion of acute patients examined the same day as hospitalized increased from 56.6 to 83.1%. Odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for treatment with statins [3.42(3.27;3.57)]  RAS-inhibitors [1.85(1.77;1.93)]  and acetylsalicylic acid [1.43(1.37;1.49)] at the time of coronary angiography increased towards 2008-09. Elective patients received medical treatment more often than acute patients (P < 0.001). During a 10-year period  there was an increase in the mean age of patients and the proportion of female patients  and a 56% increase in number of coronary angiographies performed. The use of prophylactic cardiovascular drugs among these high-risk patients increased during our study period.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Hepatorenal syndrome: diagnosis  treatment and prevention]. Cirrhosis  ascites and renal impairment are associated with high morbidity and mortality. The hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a type of renal failure that affects patients with cirrhosis and ascites. This paper provides an update on evidence-based interventions in HRS. A number of factors can precipitate HRS. The monitoring  prevention  early detection  and correct treatment of these are essential. Terlipressin combined with albumin is the first-line treatment of type 1 HRS. In type 2 HRS with refractory ascites  liver transplantation and TIPS should be considered.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Ictal analgesia in temporal lobe epilepsy - The mechanism of seizure-related burns. Seizure-related injuries have major impact in the excess mortality and morbidity of epilepsy patients. Experimental data suggest that analgesia may develop during seizures contributing to the severity of seizure-related accidents  especially burns. We aimed to identify those seizure-types that may lead to burn-injuries by seizure-related analgesia. In our tertiary epilepsy centre  we asked 100 epilepsy patients having a history of seizure-related injury  to complete our burn-and-pain questionnaire. Fifty-one patients completed the survey; their epileptology data were collected and those with a seizure-related burn were interviewed. Forty-two out of the 51 patients (82%) had partial epilepsy and 9 (18%) had idiopathic generalised epilepsy. Twenty-six persons (51%) reported decreased pain perception during or after seizures in general. Twelve patients (23%) had suffered one or more seizure-related burn. Five of them fell onto a hot surface or fire accidentally  during generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Seven out of the 12 burnt patients (58%) grasped a hot object or reached into boiling fluid during complex partial seizures; without experiencing-  or reacting in response to pain. These patients had temporal lobe epilepsy  5 of them had left temporal seizure onset. Our hypothesis based on the circumstantial analysis of our patients' burn-injuries; is that temporal lobe seizures may cause ictal/postictal analgesia. It may be caused by the seizure-related epileptic facilitation of the periaqueductal gray matter; the central pain-inhibiting structure of the brain. Seizure-related endogenous opioid-release my have a contributory role in inhibiting pain-perception. Ictal analgesia warrants better burn-prevention in temporal lobe epilepsy patients. Understanding the mechanism of ictal analgesia and specifying those seizures-types prone to cause it; may help indentifying human pain-inhibiting pathways.
Family Practice,,,Psychiatric caseness is a marker of major depressive episode in general practice. Screening for a major depressive episode (MDE) in high-risk groups of patients within the primary care setting has been suggested by several Central Health Organizations. The objective of this study was to investigate whether patients rated as "psychiatric cases" by their general practitioner (GP) were likely to suffer from MDE and therefore qualified for systematic diagnostic screening. Cross-sectional survey of primary care patients assessed through depression screening questionnaires and GP consultations. A total of 676 general practices in Denmark  Finland  Norway  and Sweden. Subjects. A total of 8879 unselected primary care patients. sensitivity  specificity  and Youden Index of the GPs' diagnoses of depression and psychiatric caseness versus patients' MDE status. The proportion of primary care patients receiving a false-positive diagnosis of depression by their GP ranged from 12.4% to 25.2% depending on country. The corresponding numbers for the false-negative diagnoses were 0.9-2.5% [corrected]. Among patients with MDE  GPs recognize the disease in 56-75% of cases. However  GPs recognize as many as 79-92% of patients with MDE as "psychiatric cases". This report confirms that misclassifications of MDE are common in the primary care setting. In addition  it shows that psychiatric caseness is a valid marker for the presence of MDE in primary care patients. This relationship should be considered in future screening recommendations.
Family Practice,,,Prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder in general practice in Denmark  Finland  Norway  and Sweden. This study assessed the prevalence rate of generalized anxiety disorder among patients of general practitioners in Denmark  Finland  Norway  and Sweden and determined whether general practitioners recognize the condition and its correlates. Data were gathered in September 2001. Participating patients received a questionnaire that included the Generalized Anxiety Questionnaire and the Depression Screening Questionnaire. The scale used DSM-IV criteria to identify generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive episode. General practitioners filled in a questionnaire about their patients' mental and physical illnesses  including generalized anxiety and major depressive episode. General practitioners' basic sociodemographic data and professional career information were also gathered. A total of 648 general practitioners and 8 879 patients participated in the study. The age-standardized rates for generalized anxiety disorder ranged from 4.1 to 6.0 percent for males and from 3.7 to 7.1 percent for females; for major depressive episode the rates ranged from 7.2 to 11.5 percent for males and from 9.9 to 14.2 percent for females. The proportion of generalized anxiety disorder cases recognized by general practitioners varied from 33 percent in Denmark to 53 percent in Norway. Recognition of generalized anxiety disorder by general practitioners was associated with presentation of anxiety problems by the patients. Physical symptoms as a reason for a consultation was associated with lowered recognition of generalized anxiety disorder. Previous diagnoses of generalized anxiety disorder or anxiety neurosis were associated with increased recognition of generalized anxiety disorder. Of the total percentage of cases of generalized anxiety disorder in general practice (4.8 percent for males and 6.0 percent for females)  only one-third to one-half of the cases were identified by the general practitioners.
Radiology,,,MRI diagnosis of fracture of the scaphoid bone: impact of a new practice where the images are read by radiographers. To investigate whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiographers are able to evaluate MRI examinations with regard to scaphoid fractures to save patients unnecessary immobilization and clinical and radiographic examinations  and to reduce the costs for the hospital as well as society in general. Over a 1-year period 224 consecutive patients with a suspected clinical scaphoid fracture but negative radiography were referred for MRI and examined within 11 hours. The MR images were primarily evaluated by the MRI radiographer on duty. Other fractures and bone edema were not reported because these were not part of the work-up protocol agreed upon by the radiology and the orthopedic departments. The following weekday a final report was provided by a radiologist. For the economical analysis the official price-list for Danish hospital service was used. The MRI radiographers reported 43 scaphoid fractures  whereas the radiologist ultimately diagnosed only 36 scaphoid fractures (16.1% of patients) (sensitivity  100%; specificity  96.3%). Six of the seven false-positive fractures occurred in patients with edema of the scaphoid. The seventh false-positive was a fracture of the capitate. The hospital saved at least 20 000 and the social care system 70.000. It is possible to provide an acute MRI service to patients with clinically suspected fracture of the scaphoid and a normal plain radiograph. The MR images can be primarily read by sufficiently trained MR radiographers. This new work-up protocol reduces the cost for society.
General Practice,,,Identification of patients with incident cancers using administrative registry data. On-time identification of incident cancer patients is important in cancer research to ensure quality in cancer treatment and care. Nevertheless  the Danish Cancer Registry (DCR) is updated on an annual basis rather than continuously  and no standardised algorithm exists to enable sampling from administrative data which are updated on a monthly basis. The aim of this study was to develop and validate an algorithm for on-time sampling of incident cancer patients based on administrative data. The study was based on registry and questionnaire data from incident cancer patients' general practitioners (GPs). An algorithm for on-time sampling of incident cancer patients was developed and validated in 2008 (12 747 patients) and further developed and validated in 2010 (7 996 patients). Questionnaire data from the GPs and data from the DCR were used as gold standards. The completeness over time of the 2010 cohort was evaluated. Further development of the 2008 algorithm into the 2010 algorithm increased its positive predictive value (PPV) to 95.0%. The PPV of a patient from the 2010 cohort being registered in the DCR was 97.4%. The 2010 algorithm displayed a completeness of 60% in the first month and 95% after four months. A valid and cost-saving algorithm for on-time sampling of incident cancer patients has been developed with great potential for research and quality assurance. This work was funded by the Danish Cancer Society and the Novo Nordisk Foundation. not relevant.
Epidemiology,,,Agreement between patient-reported and doctor-reported patient intervals and date of first symptom presentation in cancer diagnosis - a population-based questionnaire study. The concept of delay in cancer diagnosis has been a scientific issue for decades  and there is still no standardised and validated way to measure the time intervals. One of the intervals that are difficult to measure is the patient interval (i.e. the period from the patient's first symptom until the first presentation to the health care system) because dates of symptom onset and first presentation are difficult to establish precisely. Further  since patients may have another experience of the diagnostic pathway than e.g. the general practitioner (GP)  a reasonable question remains whether patients and GPs agree on these important milestones. The objective of this study was to analyse the agreement between patient-reported and GP-reported patient intervals and date of first presentation of cancer-related symptom(s) to the GP. On the basis of a cohort study  we included incident cancer patients from the former Aarhus County from 1 September  2004 to 31 August  2005. Both patients and GPs reported the length of the patient interval and the date of the first presentation to the GP with a cancer-related symptom measured by self-administered questionnaires. Agreement was measured using agreement-survival plots and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). There was full agreement between GP- and patient-reported patient intervals in 21.0% of all the cancer cases. In 50.1% of cases  patients and GPs agreed about the patient interval within a margin of one month. There was full agreement between GP- and patient-reported date of first presentation in 37.5% of the cancer cases and within one week in 52.0% of all the cancer cases. Overall  the agreement on the length of the patient interval was poor (CCC=0.513)  but better for patients presenting with alarm symptoms. The agreement was moderate between GP- and patient-reported dates of first presentation (CCC=0.924). We found that GPs systematically reported a longer patient interval than patients did. We found moderate agreement on reported date of first presentation of symptoms to the GP  meaning that the disagreement in reported patient interval is related to date of first symptom rather than date of first presentation to the GP.
Epidemiology,,,German translation and content validation of the OSTRC Questionnaire on overuse injuries and health problems. The aim of this study was to translate  culturally adapt and validate the Oslo Sports Trauma Research Centre (OSTRC) Questionnaire on Health Problems into the German context. A slightly modified back-translation method was used to translate the questionnaire. Validation was done in 24 high-level Paralympic athletes followed over 20 consecutive weeks. The translated version of the questionnaire showed a very high internal consistency and good test-retest reliability (Cronbach's α 0.92  intraclass correlation coefficient 0.91). Additionally  we observed high acceptance and compliance from our cohort of athletes  whose mean weekly response rate was 91.5%. Overall  114 training days were lost because of illness or injury within the 20 weeks and  on average  5 athletes per week (20.8%) reported health problems. This study demonstrates that the translated German version of the OSTRC Questionnaire is a reliable and valid tool with high internal consistency for the medical monitoring of German athletes. The OSTRC-G now offers the opportunity for a continued surveillance of high-level German athletes.
Telemedicine,,,The impact of "modern telecommunication" in palliative care--the views of the professionals. Specialized palliative care teams are typically based in larger hospitals  from where home visits  telephone consultations  and support are given directly to patients and relatives  but also to professionals working on the frontline. One of the challenges is the long distances to the patients' homes. Modern telecommunication may help overcome this  but little is known about the perceived advantages and barriers to palliative care. This study analyzed the views on modern telecommunication from specialized palliative care professionals' perspective. This descriptive study is based on four semistructured group interviews where 17 health professionals from three different palliative care teams in the Central Denmark Region were interviewed from November 2009 to March 2010. We found that face-to-face communication is essential. The participants perceived a potentially added communicative value in visual telecommunication but would never let it replace face-to-face communication. Ethical and practical concerns were expressed on the implementation of "modern telecommunication" and in particular strong reservations against permanent telemonitoring in the patient's home. Our study underlines the necessity of face-to-face contact in optimal palliative care and that home visits were favored. The participants were generally positive toward telecommunication  although reservations and prerequisites were voiced.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Persistent use of evidence-based pharmacotherapy in heart failure is associated with improved outcomes. Undertreatment with recommended pharmacotherapy is a common problem in heart failure and may influence prognosis. We studied initiation and persistence of evidence-based pharmacotherapy in 107 092 patients discharged after first hospitalization for heart failure in Denmark from 1995 to 2004. Prescriptions of dispensed medication and mortality were identified by an individual-level linkage of nationwide registers. Inclusion was irrespective of left ventricular function. Treatment with renin-angiotensin inhibitors (eg  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-2 receptor blockers)  beta-blockers  spironolactone  and statins was initiated in 43%  27%  19%  and 19% of patients  respectively. Patients who did not initiate treatment within 90 days of discharge had a low probability of later treatment initiation. Treatment dosages were in general only 50% of target dosages and were not increased during long-term treatment. Short breaks in therapy were common  but most patients reinitiated treatment. Five years after initiation of treatment  79% patients were still on renin-angiotensin inhibitors  65% on beta-blockers  56% on spironolactone  and 83% on statins. Notably  multiple drug treatment and increased severity of heart failure was associated with persistence of treatment. Nonpersistence with renin-angiotensin inhibitors  beta-blockers  and statins was associated with increased mortality with hazard ratios for death of 1.37 (95% CI  1.31 to 1.42)  1.25 (95% CI  1.19 to 1.32)  1.88 (95% CI  1.67 to 2.12)  respectively. Persistence of treatment was high once medication was started  but treatment dosages were below recommended dosages. Increased severity of heart failure or increased number of concomitant medications did not worsen persistence  but nonpersistence identified a high-risk population of patients who required special attention. A focused effort on early treatment initiation  appropriate dosages  and persistence with the regimen is likely to provide long-term benefit.
Rehabilitation,,,Does knee awareness differ between different knee arthroplasty prostheses? A matched  case-control  cross-sectional study. Low knee awareness after Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) has become the ultimate goal in trying to achieve a natural feeling knee that meet patient expectations. To accommodate this manufacturers of TKAs have developed new prosthetic designs that potentially could give patients a more natural feeling knee during activities. The purpose af this study was to compare the Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) and Oxford Knee Score (OKS) of patients treated with a previous generation standard Cruciate Retaining (CR) TKA to the scores obtained by patients treated with a newer generation CR TKA or a mobile bearing CR TKA. We identified all patients receiving a new generation CR TKA or mobile bearing TKA at our institution between 2010 and 2012. These were matched to a population of patients receiving a standard CR TKA regarding age  gender  year of surgery  Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade and pre- and postoperative knee alignment. Patients were asked to complete the FJS and OKS questionnaires. Of the 316 patients completing the survey 64 standard CR TKAs to 35 new generation CR TKAs and 121 standard CR TKAs to 68 mobile bearing TKAs were matched. The FJS and OKS scores of the three TKA designs were compared. When comparing the new generation CR TKAs to the standard CR TKAs we found statistically significant higher OKS and FJS scores (6 (p = 0.04) and 16 (p = 0.03) points respectively) for the new generation CR TKAs. When comparing the mobile bearing TKAs to the standard CR TKAs we found a statistically significant higher OKS score (3 points  p = 0.04)  and a higher but non-significant FJS score (4 points  p = 0.48) for the mobile bearing TKAs. Patients receiving the new generation CR TKA obtained higher FJS and OKS scores when compared to patients receiving a standard CR TKA  indicating that the use of this newer prosthetic design facilitate less knee awareness and better function after TKA.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Multidisciplinary treatment on vulvodynia--where is the evidence?]. Vulvodynia is a chronic pain syndrome in vulva with a prevalence of nearly 15%. Due to poorly understood pathophysiology and lack of efficient treatment frustration is vastly spread among affected women and their physicians. Behavioural  medical and surgical interventions are widely used  but hardly any of them show significance compared to placebo effect. A multidisciplinary treatment is considered to be the new state of the art treatment  but evidence for such a model is hard to find. This article is a review and evaluation of the many treatment models and their evidence.
Global Health,,,Consortium analysis of gene and gene-folate interactions in purine and pyrimidine metabolism pathways with ovarian carcinoma risk. We reevaluated previously reported associations between variants in pathways of one-carbon (1-C) (folate) transfer genes and ovarian carcinoma (OC) risk  and in related pathways of purine and pyrimidine metabolism  and assessed interactions with folate intake. Odds ratios (OR) for 446 genetic variants were estimated among 13 410 OC cases and 22 635 controls  and among 2281 cases and 3444 controls with folate information. Following multiple testing correction  the most significant main effect associations were for dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD) variants rs11587873 (OR = 0.92; p = 6 × 10⁻⁵) and rs828054 (OR = 1.06; p = 1 × 10⁻⁴). Thirteen variants in the pyrimidine metabolism genes  DPYD  DPYS  PPAT  and TYMS  also interacted significantly with folate in a multivariant analysis (corrected p = 9.9 × 10⁻⁶) but collectively explained only 0.2% of OC risk. Although no other associations were significant after multiple testing correction  variants in SHMT1 in 1-C transfer  previously reported with OC  suggested lower risk at higher folate (p(interaction) = 0.03-0.006). Variation in pyrimidine metabolism genes  particularly DPYD  which was previously reported to be associated with OC  may influence risk; however  stratification by folate intake is unlikely to modify disease risk appreciably in these women. SHMT1 SNP-by-folate interactions are plausible but require further validation. Polymorphisms in selected genes in purine metabolism were not associated with OC.
Global Health,,,Latitudinal patterns of travel among returned travelers with influenza: results from the GeoSentinel Surveillance Network  1997-2007. Influenza is a common vaccine-preventable disease among international travelers  but few data exist to guide use of reciprocal hemisphere or out-of-season vaccines. We analyzed records of ill-returned travelers in the GeoSentinel Surveillance Network to determine latitudinal travel patterns in those who acquired influenza abroad. Among 37 542 ill-returned travelers analyzed  59 were diagnosed with influenza A and 11 with influenza B. Half of travelers from temperate regions to the tropics departed outside influenza season. Twelve travelers crossed hemispheres from one temperate region to another  five during influenza season. Ten of 12 travelers (83%) with influenza who crossed hemispheres were managed as inpatients. Proportionate morbidity estimates for influenza A acquisition were highest for travel to the East-Southeast Asian influenza circulation network with 6.13 (95% CI 4.5-8.2) cases per 1000 ill-returned travelers  a sevenfold increased proportionate morbidity compared to travel outside the network. Alternate hemisphere and out-of-season influenza vaccine availability may benefit a small proportion of travelers. Proportionate morbidity estimates by region of travel can inform pre-travel consultation and emphasize the ease of acquisition of infections such as influenza during travel.

Epidemiology,,,Elevated plasma vitamin B12 levels and cancer prognosis: A population-based cohort study. Elevated plasma vitamin B12 levels (cobalamin  Cbl) are associated with increased short-term cancer risk among patients referred for this laboratory measurement. We aimed to assess prognosis in cancer patients with elevated plasma Cbl. We conducted a population-based cohort study using data from Danish medical registries during 1998-2014. The study included 25 017 patients with a cancer diagnosis and Cbl levels of 200-600 pmol/L (reference/normal range)  601-800 pmol/L and >800 pmol/L measured up to one year prior to diagnosis  and a comparison cohort of 61 988 cancer patients without a plasma Cbl measurement. Patients treated with Cbl were excluded. Survival probability was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves. Mortality risk ratios (MRR) were computed using Cox proportional hazard regression  adjusted for age  sex  calendar year  cancer stage and comorbidity  scored using the Charlson comorbidity index. Survival probabilities were lower among patients with elevated Cbl levels than among patients with normal levels and among members of the comparison cohort [(1-year survival %) Cbl: 200-600 pmol/L: 69.3%; 601-800 pmol/L: 49.6%; >800 pmol/L: 35.8%; comparison cohort: 72.6%]. Thirty-day mortality was elevated for patients with Cbl levels of 601-800 pmol/L or >800 pmol/L  compared to patients with levels of 200-600 pmol/L [(MRR (95% confidence interval): 601-800 pmol/L vs. 200-600 pmol/L: 1.9 (1.6-2.2); >800 pmol/L vs. 200-600 pmol/L: 2.7 (2.4-3.1)]. This association remained robust for 31-90-day and 91-365-day mortality  showing similar dose-response patterns. Cancer patients with elevated Cbl levels had higher mortality than those with normal Cbl levels. These findings may have clinical significance for assessing the prognosis of cancer patients.
Family Practice,,,[Laser treatment of sinusitis in general practice assessed by a double-blind controlled study]. The effect of Low Level Laser therapy (Galium-Aluminium-Arsenide laser  30 mW/830 nm  Unilaser 2000 3B) on sinuitis was evaluated in a double-blind randomised clinical study comprising 60 patients from general practice. All patients received three treatments (90 seconds radiation on each sinus) with one to three days interval. No statistically significant differences in pain relief  well-being or duration of illness were observed between patients treated with laser and a placebo.
General Practice,,,LIFESTAT - Living with statins: An interdisciplinary project on the use of statins as a cholesterol-lowering treatment and for cardiovascular risk reduction. LIFESTAT is an interdisciplinary project that leverages approaches and knowledge from medicine  the humanities and the social sciences to analyze the impact of statin use on health  lifestyle and well-being in cohorts of Danish citizens. The impetus for the study is the fact that 10% of the population in the Scandinavian countries are treated with statins in order to maintain good health and to avoid cardiovascular disease by counteracting high blood levels of cholesterol. The potential benefit of treatment with statins should be considered in light of evidence that statin use has prevalent and unintended side effects (e.g. myalgia  and glucose and exercise intolerance). The LIFESTAT project combines invasive human experiments  biomedical analyses  nationwide surveys  epidemiological studies  qualitative interviews  media content analyses  and ethnographic participant observations. The study investigates the biological consequences of statin treatment; determines the mechanism(s) by which statin use causes muscle and mitochondrial dysfunction; and analyzes achievement of treatment goals  people's perception of disease risk  media influence on people's risk and health perception  and the way people manage to live with the risk (personally  socially and technologically). CONCLUSIONS THE ORIGINALITY AND SUCCESS OF LIFESTAT DEPEND ON AND DERIVE FROM ITS INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH  IN WHICH THE DISCIPLINES CONVERGE INTO THOROUGH AND HOLISTIC STUDY AND DESCRIBE THE IMPACT OF STATIN USE ON THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF STATIN USERS THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR MUCH GREATER BENEFIT THAN ANY ONE OF THE DISCIPLINES ALONE INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL DISCIPLINES PROVIDES NOVEL PERSPECTIVES ON POTENTIAL CURRENT AND FUTURE SOCIAL  MEDICAL AND PERSONAL BENEFITS OF STATIN USE.
General Practice,,,Determinants of frequent attendance in Danish general practice: a cohort-based cross-sectional study. Previous studies addressing determinants of frequent attendance have mainly focused on socio-demographic  psychosocial and medical factors  and few had data on lifestyle and gender-specific factors. This study aims to describe determinants of general practice frequent attendance in Danish adult population  by examining lifestyle  socio-demographic  medical and gender-specific factors. For 54 849 participants of the Danish Diet  Cancer and Health cohort (50-65 year old) we obtained data on visits to general practitioner (GP) from the Danish National Health Service Register at cohort baseline (1993-97)  when information on medical conditions and lifestyle  socio-demographic and gender-specific factors was collected by questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to identify determinants of frequent attendance  defined as top 10% GP users at the year of recruitment into the cohort (baseline) in the period between 1993 and 1997. Frequent attenders accounted for 40% of all face-to-face GP consultations with a mean 12 visits/year. Women were more likely to be frequent attenders  in crude (Odds ratio: 1.95; 95% Confidence Interval: 1.85-2.06) and fully adjusted (1.26; 1.09-1.47) model. In a fully adjusted model  strongest determinants of frequent attendance were pre-existing medical conditions  with hypertension (2.58; 2.42-2.75)  diabetes (2.24; 1.94-2.59)  and mental illness (2.29; 2.09-2.52) more than doubling the odds of being FA. High education (0.63; 0.57-0.69  >4 years higher education vs. no vocational training) and employment (0.61; 0.57-0.65) were inversely associated with frequent attendance. Finally  obesity (1.54; 1.14-2.08)  smoking (1.21; 1.12-1.30  current vs. never)  physical activity (0.84; 0.80-89)  alcohol consumption (0.83; 0.78-0.87 above vs. below recommended level)  and hormone therapy in women (1.52; 1.42-1.63) were all significant determinants of frequent attendance. In addition to pre-existing medical conditions  gender  socio-demographic and gender-specific factors  lifestyle (obesity  smoking  exercise and alcohol use) is also an independent determinant of frequent attendance at general practitioner.
General Practice,,,Predictive value of the official cancer alarm symptoms in general practice--a systematic review. The objective of this study was to investigate the evidence for positive predictive value (PPV) of alarm symptoms and combinations of symptoms for colorectal cancer  breast cancer  prostate cancer and lung cancer in general practice. This study is based on a literature search performed in PubMed  Embase  the Cochrane database and at ClinicalTrials.gov in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. The main outcome measure used was PPV. A total of 16 eligible studies were identified. The intervals in the brackets refer to the variation of the results in the studies. Colorectal cancer: The PPV of "rectal bleeding" was high for patients > 60 years (6.6-21.2%)  but much lower in younger age groups. For "change in bowel habits" and "significant general symptoms"  the PPV was 3.5-8.5%. Breast cancer: "Palpable suspected tumour" was well supported (8.1-24%). No studies on the predictive value of "pitting of the skin"  "papil-areola eczema/ulceration" and "suspect axillary lymph nodes" were found. Prostate cancer: One study showed a high PPV for positive rectal examination (12%). The value for "lower urinary tract symptoms" was low (1.0-3.0%). PPV for "perianal pain" and "haemospermia" were not found. Lung cancer: For "haemoptysis" the PPV increased from 8.4 in patients aged 55 years to 20.4 at the age of > 85 years. PPV for "cough"  "pain in the thorax"  "dyspnoea" and "general symptoms" were low (0.4-1.1%). Using a new algorithm that estimates the PPV of combinations of symptoms and risk factors  a higher PPV may be achieved. A few of the alarm symptoms show a high PPV  whereas the PPV for some symptoms currently remains unknown. To improve the GPs' diagnostic judgment  a new algorithm for calculating the PPV for combinations of symptoms and risk factors seems promising.
General Practice,,,Evaluation of a policy to strengthen case management and quality of diabetes care in general practice in Denmark. To evaluate the utilization of a policy for strengthening general practitioner's case management and quality of care of diabetes patients in Denmark incentivized by a novel payment mode. We also want to elucidate any geographical variation or variation on the basis of practice features such as solo- or group practice  size of practice and age of the GP. On the basis registers encompassing reimbursement data from GPs and practice specific information about geographical location (region)  type of practice (solo- or group-practice)  size of practice (number of patients listed) and age of the GP were are able to determine differences in use of the policy in relation to the practice-specific information. At the end of the study period (2007-2012) approximately 30% of practices have enrolled extending services to approximately 10% of the diabetes population. There is regional--as well as organizational differences between GPs who have enrolled and the national averages with enrolees being younger  from larger practices and with more patients listed. Our study documents an organizationally and regionally varied and limited utilization with the overall incentive structure defined in the policy not strong enough to move the majority of GPs to change their way of delivering and financing care for patients with diabetes within a period of more than 5 years.
General Practice,,,General practice and primary health care in Denmark. General practice is the corner stone of Danish primary health care. General practitioners (GPs) are similar to family physicians in the United States. On average  all Danes have 6.9 contacts per year with their GP (in-person  telephone  or E-mail consultation). General practice is characterized by 5 key components: (1) a list system  with an average of close to 1600 persons on the list of a typical GP; (2) the GP as gatekeeper and first-line provider in the sense that a referral from a GP is required for most office-based specialists and always for in- and outpatient hospital treatment; (3) an after-hours system staffed by GPs on a rota basis; (4) a mixed capitation and fee-for-service system; and (5) GPs are self-employed  working on contract for the public funder based on a national agreement that details not only services and reimbursement but also opening hours and required postgraduate education. The contract is (re)negotiated every 2 years. General practice is embedded in a universal tax-funded health care system in which GP and hospital services are free at the point of use. The current system has evolved over the past century and has shown an ability to adapt flexibly to new challenges. Practice units are fairly small: close to 2 GPs per unit plus nurses and secretaries. The units are fully computerized  that is  with computer-based patient records and submission of prescriptions digitally to pharmacies etc. Over the past few years a decrease in solo practices has been seen and is expected to accelerate  in part because of the GP age structure  with many GPs retiring and new GPs not wanting to practice alone. This latter workforce trend is pointing toward a new model with employed GPs  particularly in rural areas.
General Practice,,,The Danish National Health Service Register. To describe the Danish National Health Service Register in relation to research. The register contains data collected for administrative and scientific purposes from health contractors in primary health care. It includes information about citizens  providers  and health services but minimal clinical information. The register covers everyone living in Denmark and data is available from 1990. No validity studies have been reported. Because the data is connected to reimbursement the coverage is assumed to be good. The strengths of the register include completeness  size  and long follow-up period. It is useful for research purposes but reservations must be made regarding its validity.
Health Services Administration,,,When resources get sparse: a longitudinal  qualitative study of emotions  coping and resource-creation when parenting a young child with severe disabilities. Parents who realize that their newborn child is severely disabled often experience severe physical and emotional stress. Parental well-being is essential for the care-taking of the child. It is yet not known why some cope well and others do not. The aim of this study was to explore how parents coped with parenting a disabled child and how they maintained their energy and personal resources. We explored parents' experiences  coping and resources over a two-year period after their child was diagnosed with a severely disabling condition using a qualitative  longitudinal approach. Findings were interpreted in a theoretical framework of Lazarus and Folkman's studies on coping and Fredrickson's broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions  as well as theories of positive illusions and benefit finding during severe adversity. We found that parents continually created and sustained their personal resources through positive cognitive reappraisals of their circumstances  the consequences of those circumstances and their coping possibilities. Nine main coping strategies were identified constituting transformative pathways in resource-creation. A theory of resource-creation is proposed as an addition to the current understanding of coping and the role of positive emotions. Coping and resources were found to be closely interrelated and portals of intervention are discussed.
Family Practice,,,The pattern of contact with general practice and casualty departments of immigrants and non-immigrants in Copenhagen  Denmark. In the past 30 years Denmark has experienced immigration from non-Western countries  but little is known about immigrants' use of health care. The purpose of this study was to compare and quantify the contact patterns with general practice and casualty departments of immigrants of non-Western origin and non-immigrants in Copenhagen City  Denmark. Descriptive register-based study including 2 041 454 daytime contacts in general practice  202 179 out-of-hours services and 112 733 attendances to casualty departments by 423 201 inhabitants living in Copenhagen throughout 1998. The data was analyzed using Poisson regression models. Immigrants and non-immigrants showed in broad outline the same sex and age-related pattern of contact except for ages above 60 years  where the pattern was more inconclusive. Children of immigrants aged 1-18 years had lower contact rates than non-immigrants during the daytime and in the out-of-hours services/casualty departments. Most immigrant groups aged 19-59 years made greater use of both daytime and out-of-hours services/casualty departments  especially males from Lebanon and the stateless  than non-immigrants  but the level of contact rates varied according to country of origin. The share of telephone consultations in the daytime and the out-of-hours service was much lower for immigrants than for non-immigrants. Marked differences between immigrants and non-immigrants' use of health care services were related to age and country of origin. More research is needed to explain these findings.
Clinical Nursing Research,Nursing Theory,,[The nurse-patient relationship results of an examination about relationships between patients and nurses in hospitals]. The nurse-patient relationship has received particular attention in the relevant literature. For patients in life threatening and existentially challenging situations  nursing activities often require a close intimacy. A good nurse-patient relationship is a precondition for effective nursing interventions  but by itself also contributes to the healing process. How such a relationship is realized in everyday nursing situations remains  however  unclear Literature predominantly details normative expectations on the nurse-patient relationship that are based on nursing theory or concepts from humanistic psychology. The operationalisation of these concepts into nursing practice is not given. In order to answer the research question "How do nurses experience their relationship with the patient?" qualitative interviews were conducted. Thus  the nurse-patient relationship was explored from the perspective of the nurses and considered in the context of their specific working situations. Nurses related their experiences  emotions and stress resulting from different kinds of nurse-patient relationships. Data were collected  organised and analysed following Giorgi's 1985 phenomenological analysis. Results show an ambivalence by nurses between closeness and distance in their relationship with patients. These relationships also show a polar vascillation between  for example  "sympathy" and "antipathy"  or "being able to help" and "helplessness". The development of the relationship is often not very professional and depends on the specific situation and those individual persons participating in it. It is also apparent that those models of the humanistic psychology which have been discussed in nursing contexts cannot serve as such as a basis for the development of the nurse-patient relationship. A particular aspect of developing relationships in nursing are nursing interventions which necessitate bodily contact and physical work with patients. Concepts including these aspects of nursing can serve as valid and concrete starting points in order to find a way unique to nursing to create effective relationships with patients.
General Practice,,,Self-reported symptoms and healthcare seeking in the general population--exploring "The Symptom Iceberg". Research has illustrated that the decision-making process regarding healthcare seeking for symptoms is complex and associated with a variety of factors  including gender differences. Enhanced understanding of the frequency of symptoms and the healthcare seeking behaviour in the general population may increase our knowledge of this complex field. The primary objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of self-reported symptoms and the proportion of individuals reporting GP contact  in a large Danish nationwide cohort. A secondary objective was to explore gender differences in GP contacts in response to experiencing one of the 44 predefined symptoms. A Danish nationwide cohort study including a random sample of 100 000 individuals  representative of the adult Danish population aged 20 years or above. A web-based questionnaire survey formed the basis of this study. A total of 44 different symptoms covering a wide area of alarm symptoms and non-specific frequently occurring symptoms were selected based on extensive literature search. Further  items regarding contact to the GP were included. Data on socioeconomic factors were obtained from Statistics Denmark. A total of 49 706 subjects completed the questionnaire. Prevalence estimates of symptoms varied from 49.4% (24 537) reporting tiredness to 0.11% (54) reporting blood in vomit. The mean number of reported symptoms was 5.4 (men 4.8; women 6.0). The proportion of contact to the GP with at least one symptom was 37%. The largest proportion of GP contacts was seen for individuals reporting blood in the urine (73.2%)  whereas only 11.4% of individuals with increase in waist circumference reported GP contact. For almost 2/3 of the symptoms reported  no gender differences were found concerning the proportion leading to GP contacts. Prevalence of symptoms and GP contacts are common in this overview of 44 different self-reported symptoms. For almost 2/3 of the reported symptoms no gender differences were found concerning the proportion leading to GP contacts. An enhanced understanding of healthcare seeking decisions may assist healthcare professionals in identifying patients who are at risk of postponing contact to the GP and may help development of health campaigns targeting these individuals.
General Practice,,,Alarm symptoms of upper gastrointestinal cancer and contact to general practice--A population-based study. Survival of upper gastrointestinal (GI) cancer depends on early stage diagnosis. Symptom-based guidelines and fast-track referral systems have been implemented for use in general practice. To improve diagnosis of upper GI cancer  knowledge on prevalence of alarm symptoms in the general population and subsequent healthcare-seeking is needed. A nationwide study of 100 000 adults  who were randomly selected from the general population were invited to participate in an internet-based survey. People aged ≥45 years were included in this study. Items regarding experience of specific and nonspecific alarm symptoms of upper GI cancer within the preceding 4 weeks and contact to general practitioner (GP) were included. Of the 60 562 subjects aged ≥45 years  33 040 (54.6%) completed the questionnaire. The prevalence of the specific alarm symptoms ranged between 1.1% ("repeated vomiting") and 3.4% ("difficulty swallowing"). Women had higher odds of experiencing "repeated vomiting" and "persistent and recent-onset abdominal pain"  but lower odds of experiencing "upper GI bleeding". The proportion of people contacting their GP with each of the four specific alarm symptoms ranged from 24.3% ("upper GI bleeding") to 39.9% ("repeated vomiting"). For each combination of two specific alarm symptoms  at least 52% contacted their GP. The specific alarm symptoms of upper GI cancer are not very prevalent in the general population. The proportion of GP contacts with each of the four specific symptoms varied between 24.3% and 39.9%. The proportion of GP contacts was higher in the older age and with combinations of two symptoms.
Epidemiology,,,Esophageal atresia: data from a national cohort. A prospective national register was established in 2008 to record all new cases of live-birth newborns with esophageal atresia (EA). This epidemiological survey was recommended as part of a national rare diseases plan. All 38 national centers treating EA participated by completing for each patient at first discharge a questionnaire validated by a national committee of experts. Data were centralized by the national reference center for esophageal anomalies. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed  with P-values of less than 0.05 considered statistically significant. Results of the 2008-2009 data collection are presented in this report. Three hundred seven new living cases of EA were recorded between January 1  2008  and December 31  2009. The male/female sex ratio was 1.3  and the live-birth prevalence of EA was 1.8 per 10 000 births. Major characteristics were comparable to those reported in the literature. Survival was 95%  and no correlation with caseload was noted. Epidemiologic surveys of congenital anomalies such as EA  which is a rare disease  provide valuable data for public health authorities and fulfill one important mission of reference centers. When compared with previous epidemiological data  this national population-based registry suggests that the incidence of EA remains stable.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Host tissue interaction  fate  and risks of degradable and nondegradable gel fillers. A constantly increasing number of gel fillers for aesthetic and reconstructive purposes have been introduced during the last 20 years. Most of the new ones are modified versions of the original collagen and hyaluronic acid gels. They have been reconstructed  often by adding cross-bindings to the polymer in order to obtain a more dense molecular structure  which will prolong degradation and filling effect of the gel. Other gel fillers contain particles of organic (poly-lactic acid) or inorganic (calcium hydroxylapatite) material  which have been used in human tissue for other purposes (degradable suture material and bone cement  respectively). The permanent fillers (silicone oil and polyacrylamide gel) have been used for many years  silicone mainly in the US and polyacrylamide gel in most countries outside the US and Canada. Complications occur  and they appear to be more frequent with particulated fillers  polyacrylamide gel and silicone oil. However  these complications differ in nature and depend on the filler type used. This overview presents the different gel filler types  how they interact with host tissue  and what can go wrong. The results and conclusion are based on experimental and clinical observations coupled with a search of the literature. Complications following homogenous hydrogels are caused by infection with bacteria  which have been inserted into the gel during injection. If not treated with relevant antibiotics (but instead steroids or large doses of NSAIDs) the bacteria form a biofilm  which gives rise to a low-grade chronic infection that is resistant to antibiotics. Complications following particulated gels and silicone oil are not known  but bacteria in a biofilm and/or endotoxins released by these is a possibility which deserves further investigations  primarily by using the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique.
Pharmacogenetics,,,The application of human phase 0 microdosing trials: A systematic review and perspectives. A decreasing number of new therapeutic drugs reaching the clinic has led to the publication of regulatory guidelines on human microdosing trials by the European Medicines Agency in 2004 and the US Food and Drug Administration in 2006. Microdosing trials are defined by the administration of 1/100th of the therapeutic dose and designed to investigate basic drug properties. This review investigates the current application of phase 0 trials in medical research. Thirty-three studies found in PubMed and EMBASE were systematically reviewed for aim and analytical method. Pharmacokinetic studies have been a major focus of phase 0 trials  but drug distribution  drug-drug interactions  imaging and pharmacogenomics have also been investigated. Common analytical methods were tandem mass liquid chromatography  accelerator mass spectrometry and positron emission tomography. New ongoing trials are investigating the pharmacodynamics and chemoresistance of marketed drugs  suggesting that the application of phase 0 trials is still evolving.
Veterinary Medicine,,,Field application of serodiagnostics to identify elephants with tuberculosis prior to case confirmation by culture. Three serologic methods for antibody detection in elephant tuberculosis (TB)  the multiantigen print immunoassay (MAPIA)  ElephantTB STAT-PAK kit  and DPP VetTB test  were evaluated using serial serum samples from 14 captive elephants infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 5 countries. In all cases  serological testing was performed prior to the diagnosis of TB by mycobacterial culture of trunk wash or tissue samples collected at necropsy. All elephants produced antibody responses to M. tuberculosis antigens  with 13/14 recognizing ESAT-6 and/or CFP10 proteins. The findings supported the high serodiagnostic test accuracy in detecting infections months to years before M. tuberculosis could be isolated from elephants. The MAPIA and/or DPP VetTB assay demonstrated the potential for monitoring antimycobacterial therapy and predicting TB relapse in treated elephants when continuously used in the posttreatment period. History of exposure to TB and past treatment information should be taken into consideration for proper interpretation of the antibody test results. Data suggest that the more frequent trunk wash culture testing of seropositive elephants may enhance the efficiency of the TB diagnostic algorithm  leading to earlier treatment with improved outcomes.
Nuclear Medicine,,,A Monte Carlo approach to small-scale dosimetry of solid tumour microvasculature for nuclear medicine therapies with (223)Ra-  (131)I-  (177)Lu- and (111)In-labelled radiopharmaceuticals. The small-scale dosimetry of radionuclides in solid-tumours is directly related to the intra-tumoral distribution of the administered radiopharmaceutical  which is affected by its egress from the vasculature and dispersion within the tumour. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the combined dosimetric effects of radiopharmaceutical distribution and range of the emitted radiation in a model of tumour microvasculature. We developed a computational model of solid-tumour microenvironment around a blood capillary vessel  and we simulated the transport of radiation emitted by (223)Ra  (111)In  (131)I and (177)Lu using the GEANT4 Monte Carlo. For each nuclide  several models of radiopharmaceutical dispersion throughout the capillary vessel were considered. Radial dose profiles around the capillary vessel  the Initial Radioactivity (IR) necessary to deposit 100 Gy of dose at the edge of the viable tumour-cell region  the Endothelial Cell Mean Dose (ECMD) and the Tumour Edge Mean Dose (TEMD)  i.e. the mean dose imparted at the 250-μm layer of tissue  were computed. The results for beta and Auger emitters demonstrate that the photon dose is about three to four orders of magnitude lower than that deposited by electrons. For (223)Ra  the beta emissions of its progeny deliver a dose about three orders of magnitude lower than that delivered by the alpha emissions. Such results may help to characterize the dose inhomogeneities in solid tumour therapies with radiopharmaceuticals  taking into account the interplay between drug distribution from vasculature and range of ionizing radiations.
Epidemiology,,,Incidence of sialolithiasis in Denmark: a nationwide population-based register study. Sialolithiasis is a frequent disorder affecting the salivary glands. The incidence rate (IR) has been reported to be 2.9-5.5 per 100 000 person-years  but all previous studies have been based on selected hospital data. In this study  we conducted a population-based study evaluating the IR of sialolithiasis and the IR variation according to age  gender and geography in Denmark. We included data from hospitals as well as from private ear  nose and throat (ENT) clinics. The study was based on registry data on all sialolithiasis cases in Denmark between 2003 and 2009 extracted from the Danish National Patient Registry (hospital cohort) and the Danish Regions Centre for Healthcare Statistics (private ENT clinic cohort). To validate the diagnosis  the proportion of visually confirmed cases was estimated based on patient records from subsamples of the two cohorts. The IR was 7.27 and 14.10 per 100 000 person-years based on visually confirmed cases only and on all cases  respectively. The highest IR was observed among 60- to 70-year-olds  in the North Denmark region and among females. In the validation subsamples  35% of assumed sialoliths were visually confirmed in the private ENT clinic cohort and 59% in the hospital cohort. In this first population-based study of IR on sialolithiasis  we found a substantially higher IR. With respect to both visually confirmed cases and all cases  this is higher than previously reported from studies based on selected hospital data.
Epidemiology,,,Chronic suppurative otitis media  middle ear pathology and corresponding hearing loss in a cohort of Greenlandic children. Otitis media (OM) has been observed at elevated prevalence rates in Greenlandic children. OM associated hearing loss (HL) may compromise the children's linguistic skills  social development and educational achievements. We investigated the prevalence of chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM)  otitis media with effusion (OME) and tympanic membrane sequelae of OM  and compared the corresponding hearing thresholds. In 2010 we examined a cohort of 223 Greenlandic children aged 4-10 years by video otoscopy  tympanometry and tested hearing thresholds for the low-frequencies: 500  1000 and 2000Hz and the high-frequencies: 4000 and 6000Hz. HL was categorized according to the worst hearing ear and was compared within the groups: CSOM  OME  tympanic membrane sequelae of OM and normal. Of 207 children  5.8% had CSOM  13.9% had OME and 55.6% had tympanic membrane sequelae of OM. The median pure tone average in low-frequencies/high-frequencies were: CSOM: 34.2/31.3dB  OME: 23.3/22.5dB  Sequelae of OM: 13.3/15dB and normal ears: 11.7/12.5dB. We found a significant difference (p<0.05) between the four groups. In 56.5% of all children a HL>15dB in any frequency was found  while 6.5% suffered from a bilateral low-frequency HL>25dB. The severity of OM significantly corresponded to increased HL. The burden of CSOM and HL remains high in young Greenlandic children. Aggressive treatment with antibiotics  improved hearing rehabilitation  sound field amplification in classrooms and otosurgical capacity should be further promoted in Greenland.
Specialization,,,Staged surgery after colonic decompression may be safer for the treatment of obstructive left-sided colorectal cancer in a non-specialized hospital. The management for the obstructive left sided colorectal cancer is still controversial. A retrospective study was performed on 249 consecutive patients who underwent surgical intervention for left sided colorectal cancer in our hospital. Among 36 patients who had colonic obstruction  25 patients received tumor resection while the rest of the patients received palliative stoma creation. Clinical characteristics and outcome following tumor resection was compared between patients with and without colonic obstruction. Prior to tumor resection  all patients received colonic decompression. Flowingly  20 patients received staged surgeries and five patients underwent one stage surgery  with three of the latter requiring reoperation due to anastomotic leakage. The five-year overall survival rate for patients following tumor resection was 75.5 % and 69.1 % for those with and without colonic obstruction respectively. Log-rank test showed no significant difference in overall survival between the two groups (p = 0.91). Onestage surgery for patients with obstructive colorectal cancer in our hospital was associated with frequent anastomotic leakage. Colonic obstruction itself may not be a poor prognostic factor when decompression preceded surgical resection.
Epidemiology,,,Prevalence of human papillomavirus in epithelial ovarian cancer tissue. A meta-analysis of observational studies. The role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer is controversial  and conflicting results have been published. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of HPV in epithelial ovarian cancer tissue. Observational studies published until 4 March 2013 were identified in PubMed and Embase. We adhered to MOOSE guidelines and included 22 studies (case-control  cross-sectional studies). A pooled estimate of the HPV prevalence with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated based on a random effect model. In a meta-regression analysis we examined the contribution of different factors to heterogeneity. Furthermore  publication bias was evaluated. The pooled HPV prevalence in ovarian cancer tissue was 15.5%  but wide variation was found (0-66.7%). After stratification by geographical region  publication year  tissue type and method of HPV detection  we found that the prevalence of HPV varied most markedly by geographical area  the prevalence being 45.6% (95% CI  31.0-60.3) in Asia  18.5% (95% CI  8.5-28.6) in Eastern Europe  1.1% (95% CI  -1.6 to 3.8) in Western Europe and zero in North America. A meta-regression analysis revealed that the difference between geographical regions could not be explained by HPV detection method or type of tissue. Great geographical variation exists in HPV prevalence in ovarian cancer tissue  which is not explained by different HPV detection methods. The results suggest that HPV is unlikely to play an important role in Western European and American women  but cannot reject a role of HPV in other populations.
Sports Medicine,,,[Heart screening of elite athletes]. Sudden cardiac death in competing athletes is usually caused by unsuspected heart disease  and pre-participation screening may reduce the incidence of this tragic event. Although the cost-effectiveness of screening programs is unclear  international sports associations are currently implementing mandatory screening of elite athletes. During the first year of screening in the top Danish soccer league  all athletes were found to be eligible for continued participation in the game  suggesting that concern about false positive screening results may be exaggerated.
Specialization,,,[Centralised diagnostic]. Diagnostic examinations with complicated and expensive equipment should be centralised in departments of radiology  clinical physiology and nuclear medicine  clinical biochemistry etc. For the future reorganisation of hospitals in Denmark  focus on centralisation in larger university hospitals is recommended with close collaboration between diagnostic specialities and clinical specialities  and with research and advanced competence as main assets.
Correction of Hearing Impairment,,,Bone-anchored hearing aids are effective and associated with a high degree of satisfaction. The objective of this study was to evaluate patients' satisfaction with bone-anchored hearing aids (BAHA). This study was retrospective and based on a postal questionnaire. The study sample consisted of patients undergoing surgery at Odense University Hospital in the 1992-2013-period. The questionnaire was a combination of Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life questions from the Hearing Aid Research Lab at the University of Memphis and questions used in a previous Danish study. We also used data from each patient's medical records. All information was collected in a database. The response rate was 80% and the user percentage 88. The majority of the patients used their BAHA seven days a week and most of the day. 88% reported that it was in their best interest that they had received a BAHA. 80% of the respondents were able to communicate better using their BAHA in one-on-one conversations. BAHA is helpful in one-on-one conversations in quiet surroundings. Sound quality in group situations seems to be the main problem associated with BAHA. However  this study showed that BAHA is an effective hearing aid that is associated with a high degree of satisfaction. not relevant. not relevant.
Aerospace Medicine,,,LUCAS(™)2 in Danish Search and Rescue Helicopters. Prehospital resuscitation is often challenging. Giving uninterrupted and effective compressions is relatively impossible during transportation. In 2012  The Royal Danish Air Force received a donation of 8 mechanical chest compression devices (LUCAS(™)2; Physio-Control/Jolife AB  Lund  Sweden) to be used onboard the Danish search and rescue (SAR) helicopters. The scope of this investigation was to establish whether or not mechanical chest compression devices should be considered a necessity onboard the Danish SAR helicopters. Data were compiled from SAR medical journals. From the data collected  observations were made as to when LUCAS(™)2 was used and what diagnosis the SAR physician made. One thousand ninety missions were registered in the 24-month research period  and LUCAS(™)2 was used in 25 missions. Cardiac emergencies amounted for 25% of the missions. The Danish SAR helicopters retrieved 33 drowned/hypothermic patients during the research period  and the LUCAS(™)2 was used in 11 of the patients requiring resuscitation. The LUCAS(™)2 was frequently used during other emergencies like sudden cardiac arrest. Cardiac emergencies were the predominant type of mission. LUCAS(™)2 is now considered mandatory on Danish SAR helicopters.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Limited evidence for negative pressure wound treatment of skin transplants and closed surgical wounds]. The indications for negative pressure wound treatment (NPWT) are increasing  e.g. for fixation of skin transplant and primary closed surgical wounds. The evidence for indications and positive effects are limited. NPWT should exclusively be used for fixation of split thickness skin transplants when immobilisation is otherwise difficult and for primary closed surgical wounds in selected patients at risk. Future high-quality investigations are necessary to pinpoint indications for topical negative pressure therapy  the effect of the different NPWT-modalities  and the overall economy compared to conventional bandages.
Internal Medicine,,,Every seventh acute medical admission is preventable. The majority of patients who are admitted to the departments of internal medicine are admitted acutely. The aim of this study was to evaluate the appropriateness of admissions to a community hospital in Copenhagen. During a three-week period  all patients admitted to Bispebjerg Hospital's acute medical department (AMA) were consecutively included and retrospectively evaluated by a physician using the Appropriateness Evaluation Protocol (AEP). Based on the AEP criteria  admissions were categorized as appropriate or inappropriate. Uncertain admissions were evaluated and classified by three chief consultant physicians. A total of 470 patients were included  and 14% were classified as inappropriate. A total of 73 admissions failed to met any AEP criteria  and 131 admissions only meet one AEP criterion. Prior to admission  365 patients were examined by the admitting doctor  and of patients not examined before admission  17 were classified as inappropriate. A total of 30% of all patients admitted were discharged directly from the AMA within 24-48 hours  and 42 of those were inappropriately admitted. Our study shows that 14% of acute admissions could have been prevented. We found no evidence that preadmitting examination is important to prevent inappropriate admission. Several admissions could have been handled appropriately by a diagnostic unit or through sub-acute referral to an outpatient clinic the following day. The AEP is a useful screening instrument  but insufficient for the evaluation of the handling of acute medical patients. not relevant. not relevant.
Forensic Psychiatry,,,The importance of early anti-social behaviour among men with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder in a specialist forensic psychiatry hospital unit in Denmark. People with a major mental disorder are at increased risk of committing crimes  especially violent crimes  compared with the general population. Sub-groups have been identified based on age of onset of anti-social or violent behaviour. Mentally disordered offenders with early onset anti-social behaviour tend to have a lifelong pattern of it  but in a clinical setting  are they easily identifiable as a distinct sub-group? Our main aim was to establish whether distinct groups of early and later onset offenders can be identified from the standard clinical record of men with schizophrenia spectrum disorders selected for hospital treatment after conviction for a serious crime  and to test the hypothesis that even in such a clinically selected group  early onset offending would be associated with subsequent persistent and versatile offending. A retrospective case file review of all 83 men with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder in a complete 2-year discharge cohort from one specialist secure forensic hospital unit (2001-2002). A sub-group of patients with early onset anti-social behaviour was confirmed. Prior to this specialist hospitalisation  this group had sustained significantly more criminal convictions and were more criminally versatile than their late onset peers. The recognition of clinically meaningful sub-groups among hospitalised offender patients seems straightforward  and may be useful in the development of more specifically focused intervention and in making sense of more longer-term outcomes.
Pathology,,,Experimental induced avian E. coli salpingitis: Significant impact of strain and host factors on the clinical and pathological outcome. Several types of Escherichia coli have been associated with extra-intestinal infections in poultry  however  they may vary significantly in their virulence potential. The aim of the present study was to investigate the virulence of five strains of E. coli obtained from different disease manifestations or from the cloacae of a healthy chicken. The virulence potential of the strains were evaluated in an avian experimental model for ascending infections  and experiments were conducted in both layers and broiler breeders. The clinical outcome of infection was highly depending on the challenge strain  however  not significantly reflecting the origin of the strain. In general  broiler breeders had a more severe clinical outcomes of infection compared to layers  but major with-in group diversity was observed for all challenge strains of clinical origin. A single strain of ST95 (phylogroup B2) had a distinct ability to cause disease. Results of the study shows major differences in virulence of different strains of E. coli in ascending infections; however  there was no indication of tissue-specific adaptation  since strains obtained from lesions unrelated to the reproductive system were fully capable of causing experimental infection. In conclusion  the study provides evidence for the clinical outcome of infection with E. coli in poultry is largely influenced by the specific strain as well as individual host factors.
General Practice,,,[Cross-sectorial cooperation has improved palliative care]. Project Palliation in the Odsherred Municipality is concerned with testing of a cooperation model between Lynghuset  general practice and Pain Centre  Holbæk Hospital. The purpose was to improve the palliative care to people suffering from life-threatening diseases through development of interdisciplinary and cross-sectorial cooperation. The model has shown to contribute to improvements but it also leaves room for further qualification.
Forensic Medicine,,,Hymenal lesions and legal outcome in sexually abused girls with a history of vaginal penetration. In many cultures  it is commonly accepted that the hymen remains unchanged throughout childhood  until it is torn at the first episode of sexual intercourse. Therefore  the definition of virginity is directly linked to a normal hymen. However  most girls referred for medical forensic colposcopic examination have normal or nonspecific findings  the prevalence of abnormal findings in girls with a history of genital penetration being only 4-6%. The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between hymenal findings seen at the colposcopic examination and the legal outcome: prosecution in court and conviction in court. During the 80-month period of our study  426 girls with a median age of 9 years (range 0-15 years) were included. A history of at least one vaginal penetration was given in 226 of the girls with a median age of 12 years (range 2-14 years). The hymenal findings were described as normal in 125 of the 226 cases (55%). In 50 cases (22%)  hymenal clefts were found  17 (34%) of which were complete and 33 (66%) incomplete. The finding of hymenal clefts increased with age. Of the 226 cases of girls being sexually assaulted with vaginal penetration  119 cases (53%) were prosecuted in court  102 of which (86%) resulted in conviction. Thirty-five (70%) of the cases with hymenal clefts and 100 (57%) of the cases without hymenal clefts were prosecuted in court  showing a correlation between hymenal clefts and conviction; however  the correlation was not significant (χ(2) test=2.1 and P=0.14). In total  29 (58%) of the cases with hymenal clefts and 88 (50%) of the cases without hymenal clefts were convicted in court  which shows no significance (χ(2) test=1.0 and P=0.33). The single most important feature for conviction in court is the child's testimony and not hymenal findings seen at the colposcopic examination. Especially the testimony of the older children leads to conviction  raising the question whether the videotaped testimonies are aimed at the court proceedings  or whether hearing the child's testimony directly in court has a more powerful effect. Overall  it is crucial that the videotaped police questioning of the younger children is performed by specialized personnel  with the aim of presenting the testimony in a detailed and credible manner in court  giving children of all ages a fair trial.
Forensic Medicine,,,Screening and quantitative determination of twelve acidic and neutral pharmaceuticals in whole blood by liquid-liquid extraction and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We describe a multi-method for simultaneous identification and quantification of 12 acidic and neutral compounds in whole blood. The method involves a simple liquid-liquid extraction  and the identification and quantification are performed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The method was fully validated for salicylic acid  paracetamol  phenobarbital  carisoprodol  meprobamate  topiramate  etodolac  chlorzoxazone  furosemide  ibuprofen  warfarin  and salicylamide. The method also tentatively includes thiopental  theophylline  piroxicam  naproxen  diclophenac  and modafinil  but these drugs were not included in the full validation program and are not described in detail here. Limit of quantitation was 1 mg/kg for the compounds with coefficients of variation of < 20%  except for furosemide  which had a coefficient of variation of 32% at limit of quantitation. The measuring interval was wide for most components. Extraction efficiencies were high  reflecting the high-yield capacity of the method.
Forensic Medicine,,,Medical findings and legal outcomes in sexually abused children. A previous study published in 2000 on a small group of children concluded that the medical examination in cases of sexual child abuse seldom provided legal proof of sexual abuse [J Forensic Sci 45(2000):115-7]. The present consecutive study included children referred to the police for a forensic medical examination. A colposcope was used to evaluate the anogenital findings which were classified as normal  nonspecific  and abnormal. Four hundred and eighty-two children were included. Abnormal anogenital findings were found in 38% of the girls and 20% of the boys  but there was no relation between abnormal anogenital findings and the two legal outcomes: "appearing in court" and "being convicted." However  the age of the child turned out to be a more important factor in relation to legal outcome than the physical findings. The results of this study suggest that the child's statement and not the physical findings were important for legal outcome.
Pediatrics,,,[Reasons for non-attendance and cancellations in a paediatric outpatient clinic]. It is important to identify reasons for non-attendance and late cancellations in the health care system to be able to plan possible interventions. Patients with a scheduled visit at the outpatient clinic at the Department of Paediatrics at Kolding Hospital from September 2002 to February 2003 were randomised either to receive or not receive a mailed reminder two weeks prior to their visit. Parents to children cancelling their appointment or not attending were interviewed by telephone to reveal the reasons. >Early cancellations< were defined as cancellations after receiving the letter and until the last weekday before the appointment  >late cancellations< as any subsequent cancellations. A total of 229 and 250 >early cancellations< of the 2.563 and 2.775 booked appointments were received in the control- and the intervention group  respectively (p > 0.05). Only for >forgot the appointment<  a difference was found between the reasons given. >Late cancellation< and non-attendance occurred for 167/1 177 and 68/1 189 (p < 0 01) of the children. For 118 and 36 (p < 0.01) of these  the reasons given by the parents could be classified as predictable  and 34/1 177 and 27/1 189  respectively as non-predictable (p = 0.4). In the control group more than 70% of late cancellations and non-attendances could have been predicted by the parents  receiving a mailed reminder reduced this proportion significantly. It remains a challenge to reduce the number of non-Danish speaking patients not attending.
Pediatrics,,,[Routine reminders reduce non-attendance at a pediatric outpatient clinic. A follow-up study]. We have previously shown that mailed reminders decreased the rate of non-attendance in an outpatient unit in the context of an intervention study. To evaluate the effect of the introduction of routine reminders in a real-life setting  we performed a study based on the routine registration as introduced at the Department of Paediatrics at Kolding Hospital on 1 August 2006. The number of attending and non-attending children from 1 January 2001 to 30 April 2008 was identified. The diagnosis-related group value of the out-patient production for 2007 was calculated using 2008 prices. The costs of mailing the reminders were estimated in order to calculate the economic benefits of the procedure. The rates of non-attendance before and after 1 August 2006 were 7.7% and 4.1%  respectively (p < 0.0001)  corresponding to 36 avoided cases of non-attendance per 1.000 planned appointments. However  the effect of the mailed reminders decreased from 2006 to 2008  though insignificantly (p = 0 087). In 2007 the cost of the avoided nonattendance was 64 337 DKK per 1 000 appointments. The costs associated with the mailed reminders were estimated to 13 824 DKK per 1 000 reminders. Therefore  the overall economic benefit was 50 513 DKK per 1 000 planned appointments. Introducing mailed reminders as a routine measure decreased the non-attendance rate  though less than was found in the preceding intervention study. The procedure was evaluated as being cost-effective.
Pediatrics,,,[Mailed reminders reduce non-attendance at a pediatric outpatient clinic. An intervention study]. There is an increased focus on non-attendance for treatment at hospitals as this may lead to poor utilization of resources and hamper the possibility of offering patients treatment within one month. As the rate of non-attendance or very late cancellations of appointments was unacceptably high at the Department of Paediatrics at Kolding Hospital  we decided to examine the effect of mailed reminders. A controlled intervention study in which families with an appointment at the out-patient clinic in uneven weeks received a mailed reminder. Families with bookings in even weeks served as controls. Late cancellations and non-attendances were registered. Data were analysed for the patients' first planned booking in the project period from September 2002 to February 2003. A total of 1 177 patients were included in the control group and 1 189 in the intervention group. The number of late cancellations and non-attendances were 167 (14.2%) and 68 (5.7%) (p < 0.001)  respectively  of which 112 (9.5%) and 29 (2.4%) were non-attendances (p < 0.0001). The study did not identify groups of patients who did not benefit from the reminder. In a Danish paediatric out-patient clinic the number of non-attendances and late cancellations can be reduced significantly by mailed reminders two weeks prior to the visit.
Anesthesiology,Evidence-Based Medicine,,[Does evidence lead to a change in clinical practice? Danish anaesthetists' and nurse anesthetists' clinical practice and knowledge of postoperative residual curarization]. Recent studies have shown a high incidence of postoperative residual curarization (PORC). The reason for this is unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the methods used by Danish anaesthetists to exclude PORC are evidence-based and  if they are not  to determine the reasons why. 251 anaesthetists (nurses and physicians) from eight different hospital anaesthetic departments completed a questionnaire concerning their knowledge about and clinical practice of residual curarization. All of the 251 participants filled in the questionnaire. 91% underestimated the incidence of PORC after the administration of intermediate-acting muscle relaxants  and 27% incorrectly believed that it is always possible to exclude PORC using clinical tests. Only 45% knew that the train-of-four ratio must exceed 0.9 to exclude residual curarization  and only 25% knew that clinically significant residual curarization cannot be excluded by tactile/visual evaluation of the response to train-of-four nerve stimulation. 91% had access to a nerve stimulator  85% with the option of objective monitoring. 13% used a nerve stimulator seldom or never. The overall attitude toward using nerve stimulators was positive. The results indicate that Danish anaesthetists" clinical practice regarding residual curarization is often not evidence-based. The reason for this seems to be a lack of knowledge  rather than lack of resources and/or a negative attitude toward neuromuscular monitoring.
General Practice,,,[Cross-sectorial cooperation has improved palliative care]. Project Palliation in the Odsherred Municipality is concerned with testing of a cooperation model between Lynghuset  general practice and Pain Centre  Holbæk Hospital. The purpose was to improve the palliative care to people suffering from life-threatening diseases through development of interdisciplinary and cross-sectorial cooperation. The model has shown to contribute to improvements but it also leaves room for further qualification.
Gynecology,,,Revised criteria for PCOS in WHO Group II anovulatory infertility - a revival of hypothalamic amenorrhoea? To evaluate revised criteria for polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) in the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in anovulatory infertility. Prospective cohort study. WHO Group II anovulatory infertile women (n = 75). Clinical  sonographic and endocrine parameters  including anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH). The Rotterdam criteria for PCOM (antral follicle count (AFC) ≥12 and/or ovarian volume >10 ml) were fulfilled in 93% of the women. The PCOM prevalence was 68% when increasing the threshold to AFC >20 and 76% according to an AMH-based threshold of >35 pmol/l. The most recently proposed AFC ≥ 25 threshold reduced the PCOM prevalence to 52% (n = 39)  leaving 48% (n = 36) without features of PCOM. Comparing the 36 women with non-PCOM with the 39 women in the PCOM group according to AFC ≥ 25  22% vs 59% (P = 0·001) had serum LH >10 IU/l  11% vs 41% (P = 0·003) had an LH/FSH ratio >2 and 19% vs 41% (P = 0·04) had hirsutism and/or elevated total testosterone  free testosterone  and/or androstenedione. The non-PCOM group included significantly more women with secondary infertility. The median AMH in the non-PCOM group was 47 pmol/l  which was twofold lower than in the PCOM group but above the upper limit of normo-ovulatory women. According to a revised threshold of 25 follicles  almost half the anovulatory infertile women do not have PCOM. The characteristics of these women may be compatible with hypothalamic anovulation  but according to AMH levels  the ovaries remain multifollicular. A better distinction between hypothalamic amenorrhoea and PCOS could improve treatment strategies for anovulatory infertility.
Epidemiology,,,Diabetes among migrants in Denmark: Incidence  mortality  and prevalence based on a longitudinal register study of the entire Danish population. Studies of diabetes in migrant populations have shown a higher prevalence compared to their respective countries of origin and to people natively born in the host country  but there is little population-based data on diabetes incidence and mortality in migrant populations. The aim of the current study was (1) to describe the incidence rates and prevalence of diabetes among first generation migrants in Denmark compared to the Danish background population  and (2) to compare standardised mortality rates (SMRs) for individuals with and without diabetes according to country of origin. Information was obtained from linkage of the National Diabetes Register with mortality statistics and information from the Central Personal Register on country of origin. Age- and sex-specific estimates of prevalence  incidence rates  mortality rates and SMRs relative to the part of the population without diabetes were calculated based on follow up of the entire Danish population. Compared with native born Danes  the incidence of diabetes was about 2.5 times higher among migrants from Africa  Asia  and the Middle East  and these migrant groups also showed significantly higher prevalence. The standardised mortality rates (SMR) were higher particularly above 50years of age among most migrant groups compared with native born Danes  and with a higher annual increase. The highest diabetes incidence rates and prevalence estimates were observed among migrants from Africa  Asia  and the Middle East  and the annual increase in SMRs was higher in these groups compared to native born Danes.
Molecular Epidemiology,,,Migrant tuberculosis: the extent of transmission in a low burden country. Human migration caused by political unrest  wars and poverty is a major topic in international health. Infectious diseases like tuberculosis follow their host  with potential impact on both the migrants and the population in the recipient countries. In this study  we evaluate Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission between the national population and migrants in Denmark. Register study based on IS6110-RFLP results from nationwide genotyping of tuberculosis cases during 1992 through 2004. Cases with 100% identical genotypes were defined as clustered and part of a transmission chain. Origin of clusters involving both Danes and migrants was defined as Danish/migrant/uncertain. Subsequently  the proportion of cases likely infected by the "opposite" ethnic group was estimated. 4 631 cases were included  representing 99% of culture confirmed cases during 1992 through 2004. Migrants contributed 61.6% of cases. Up to 7.9% (95% CI 7.0-8.9) of migrants were infected by Danes. The corresponding figure was 5.8% (95% CI 4.8-7.0) for Danes. Thus  transmission from Danes to migrants occurred up to 2.5 (95% CI 1.8-3.5) times more frequent than vice versa (OR = 1). A dominant strain  Cluster-2  was almost exclusively found in Danes  particular younger-middle-aged males. Transmission between Danes and migrants is limited  and risk of being infected by the "opposite" ethnic group is highest for migrants. TB-control efforts should focus on continues micro-epidemics  e.g. with Cluster-2 in Danes  prevention of reactivation TB in high-risk migrants  and outbreaks in socially marginalized migrants  such as Somalis and Greenlanders. Fears that TB in migrants poses a threat for resident Danes seem exaggerated and unjustified. We believe this to be true for other low incidence countries as well.
Telemedicine,,,Tele-monitoring of home blood pressure in treated hypertensive patients. To compare the accuracy of clinic blood pressure (CBP) and telemedical home blood pressure (HBP) measurement in the assessment of antihypertensive effect. 362 patients on antihypertensive medication performed HBP measurement (5 days  duplicate measurements  four times daily) and ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring in random order. Main outcome measure was the agreement of CBP and HBP with daytime ABP. CBP was much higher than ABP and average HBP (p < 0.001). There was a progressive decline in HBP over the course of the study  achieving the level of daytime ABP on the last 2 monitoring days. The correlation between CBP and ABP was weak (systolic: r = 0.343  diastolic r = 0.430)  whereas strong correlations existed between HBP and ABP (systolic r = 0.804  diastolic r = 0.776). A progressive improvement in the strength of the correlation between average HBP of single days and ABP was obtained over the 5 monitoring days. The HBP readings taken in the afternoon showed a stronger correlation with ABP than the values measured in the morning  at noon and in the evening. Averaging more HBP readings taken on succeeding days resulted in a progressive improvement in the agreement with ABP with a further benefit when readings of day 1 were included. The accuracy of telemedical HBP measurement is substantially better than that of CBP. The results suggest  that HBP should be measured for 5 days  and afternoon measurements should be preferred in assessing control of hypertension.
Epidemiology,,,Exposure to negative acts and risk of turnover: a study of a register-based outcome among employees in three occupational groups. To investigate whether self-reported exposure to negative acts in the workplace (bullying and threats of violence) predicted turnover in three occupational groups (human service and sales workers  office workers and manual workers). Survey data on 2766 respondents were combined with data from a national labour force register to assess turnover. Mixed effects logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between self-reported exposure to negative acts at baseline and risk of turnover after a 1-year follow-up. We found no significant associations between exposure to negative acts (bullying and threats of violence) and risk of turnover. When participants were stratified by occupational group and analyses were adjusted for age  gender  tenure and psychosocial working conditions  we found that exposure to bullying predicted risk of turnover in office workers (OR 2.03  95 % CI 1.05-3.90)  but neither in human service and sales workers  nor in manual workers. The association in office workers lost statistical significance when additionally adjusted for depressive symptoms (OR 1.77  95 % CI 0.90-3.49). However  in a sensitivity analysis in which we used a 2-year (instead of a 1-year) follow-up period the association between bullying and turnover remained statistically significant in office workers even after adjusting for depressive symptoms (OR 2.10  95 % CI 1.17-3.76). We found no statistically significant associations between threats of violence and risk of turnover in the stratified analyses. Exposure to bullying predicted risk of turnover among office workers but not among human service and sales workers and among manual workers. Threats of violence were not associated with turnover in any occupational group.
Neurology,,,The impact of continuous and ongoing professional development on the nursing process of taking care of neurological patients. Nurses distinguish continuous professional development intended for career improvement and personal development from continuous professional development intended for improvement of skills and knowledge. Too many requests are put in front of an individual unacceptably stretching it onto the life outside work. Students have various expectations from their education. Factors that motivate nurses to study are to improve knowledge  patient care and professional relations. Factors connected to personal development include boost of confidence and embracing of other values. Motivation for additional education is also connected to the change of work  practice improvement  self-confidence improvement  nursing career plans  and necessary intellectual stimulation. The reasons for which nurses decide to undertake further education are also desire for maintenance of clinical competence  but also enjoyment in studying itself. An employer who expects from nurses to opt for such a type of education or stimulate it is another common reason.
Stroke Rehabilitation,,,Music as an auditory stimulus in stroke patients. Auditory stimulation increases mean blood flow velocity (MBFV) in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in healthy individuals. Our aim was to monitor such changes in the affected MCA of patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). The study included 66 non-thrombolysed patients with AIS who were divided into groups according to National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score. Group I consisted of patients with NIHSS score 10 and group II with NIHSS score > or =11. Affected MCA was insonated with transcranial Doppler (TCD). MCA MBFVs were monitored during listening to music for 30 minutes. The first response of MBFV increase was measured as time (Tmax) and percentage of amplitude change (Amax). Pearson Chi-Square test was used. In 78.85% of patients there was a significant increase in MBFV compared to baseline values as a reaction to the music. There was no significant difference in Tmax or Amax between the two groups. However  a trend of longer Tmax was observed with every 2 NIHSS score increase. Music is an auditory stimulus in stroke patients and can be measured with TCD as MCA MBFV increase. Although our study showed no significant change of reaction time with the severity of stroke  a trend of prolonged Tmax was observed with NIHSS score increase.
Nursing Education Research,,,An acute hospital ward  densely populated with students during a 12-week clinical study period. This article presents some thoughts and ideas about a different way to organize clinical studies for nursing students. The model involved a large group (12 to 15) of third-year nursing students taking their 12-week clinical study period on the same acute geriatric hospital ward. Difficulties with finding enough clinical study venues  together with a belief in peer learning and situated learning as important for learning  were the main reasons for trying out a model with many students doing clinical studies on the same ward. The model has been used twice  and evaluations showed that students believed the clinical study period had given them the opportunity to develop their nursing competence. Most of the students experienced cooperation with other students as self-developing. Staff experienced this model as a positive influence on students' professional development and as stimulating for the professionalism of the ward.
Family Practice,,,[General practitioners' evaluation of the out-of-hours service in Copenhagen County]. This investigation was part of a large project concerning quality development in the primary care out-of-hours service in Copenhagen County  Denmark. In August 2003 a questionnaire was sent out to all the general practitioners in Copenhagen County (n = 365  return rate: 82%). 56% of the GPs were not working in the out-of-hours service. In total  95% of those surveyed felt that the out-of-hours service is doing a good job; 95% expressed satisfaction with the professional level; and only 3% found that they did not have good cooperation with the service. 63% did not agree with the statement that the out-of-hours service is used only in acute cases of disease or acute deterioration of disease. Overall  the GPs expressed a high level of satisfaction with the out-of-hours service. They also felt that their patients were satisfied. However  the study pointed out the difference in perception between patients and doctors regarding the aim of the service.
General Practice,,,[Diagnosis  treatment and prognosis of community acquired pneumonia - results from three primary care centers in Iceland]. To study how general practitioners diagnose and treat adult patients with community acquired pneumonia (CAP) and evaluate outcomes. Retrospective chart review for one year on patients 18 years and older diagnosed with CAP in three different primary care centers in Iceland. A total of 215 patients were diagnosed with CAP. Of those 195 were both diagnosed and treated in the primary health care and 20 patients were referred for specialized care. Mean age was 50.3 years (SD= 21.0) and 126 (65%) of the patients were women. Most patients had been ill for less than a week and did not have a previously diagnosed lung disease. Cough was the most common symptom (71%) and 96% had abnormal chest auscultation. Vital signs were frequently not recorded. A chest radiograph was done in third of the cases and showed abnormality in over 80%. Most patients (94%) were treated with antibiotics usually extended spectrum penicillin. Phone consultations were the most common form of communication after diagnosis and about 12% of subjects had their antibiotics changed and about 10% had a chest radiograph done after diagnosis had been made. There was no mortality from CAP during the study period. CAP was diagnosed clinically and managed in primary care in most cases. CAP was more common in women and a minority of patients had underlying lung diseases. Vital sign measurements were used less than expected. Broad spectrum antibiotics were widely used for treatment. CAP had no mortality.
Psychiatry,,,Patients' perspectives on antidepressant treatment in consultations with physicians. Patient perspectives on antidepressant treatment and physician attention  and responses toward these in consultations with patients diagnosed with depression  are rarely studied. We analyzed video-recorded consultations with general practitioners (GPs) and psychiatrists. We used conversation analysis and systemic functional linguistics and found that the perspectives patients expressed related to the possibility of achieving  and the inability to retain  a sense of agency. Patients also presented indirect expressions of shame and expressions suggesting alienation toward medical treatment. GPs attended to patient perspectives by talking about medication indirectly. When patients expressed their perspectives  GPs responded by being nonauthoritative but also without prompting patients to elaborate on their reflections. Psychiatrists responded authoritatively and never urged patients to reflect on their perspectives. Shared decision making did not take place because physicians did not explore patients' perspectives in depth or offer their expertise by taking these perspectives into consideration.
General Practice,Psychiatry,,General practitioners' and psychiatrists' responses to emotional disclosures in patients with depression. To investigate general practitioners' (GPs') and psychiatrists' responses to emotional disclosures in consultations with patients with depression. Thirteen patient consultations with GPs and 17 with psychiatrists were video-recorded and then analyzed using conversation analysis (CA). Psychiatrists responded to patients' emotional disclosures by attempting to clarify symptoms  by rational argumentation  or by offering an interpretation of the emotions from their own perspectives. GPs responded by claiming to understand the emotions or by formulating the patients' statements  but without further exploring the emotions. GPs displayed a greater engagement with patients' emotions than psychiatrists. Their approach could be described as empathic  corresponding to a mentalizing stance. The different approaches taken by psychiatrists could represent conceptual differences and might affect fruitful interdisciplinary work. Psychiatric nurses' responses to patients' emotions must also be studied to complete our knowledge from psychiatry. Experiences from training in mentalization could be used to develop physicians' empathic or mentalizing approach. As most patients with depression are treated in primary care  developing GPs' mentalizing capacity instead of offering didactic training could have a substantial effect in the population.
Family Practice,Psychiatry,,Group supervision for general practitioners: a case study. Group supervision is a sparsely researched method for professional development in general practice. The aim of this study was to explore general practitioners' (GPs') experiences of the benefits of group supervision for improving the treatment of mental disorders. One long-established supervision group was studied closely for six months by observing the group sessions  and by interviewing GPs and their supervisors  individually and collectively. The interviews were recorded digitally and transcribed verbatim. The data were analysed using systematic text condensation. The GPs found participation in a supervision group to be a meaningful and professionally valuable activity. They experienced that supervision had improved their psychiatric skills  and that they had become more confident in carrying out talking therapies. Improvements in referral letters were also reported in relation to the communication with local community psychiatry centres. Furthermore  the GPs experienced that supervision had a positive 'spill-over effect' on everyday consultations  and that the supervision group became a forum for coping with other difficulties in their professional life as well. Trust and continuity were considered important prerequisites for disclosing and discussing professional problems. The results of this study indicate that participation in a supervision group can be beneficial for maintaining and developing GPs' skills in dealing with patients with mental health problems. Group supervision influenced other areas of GPs' professional lives as well. However  more studies are needed to assess the impact of supervision groups.
Family Practice,,,'It takes some time to get into the rhythm - and to slow the flow of thought': A qualitative study about experience of time and narrative in psychological interventions in general practice. General practitioners (GPs) treat more than 90 per cent of patients with mental disease. Time restriction is often seen as a hindrance to their engagement in psychological treatment. This study aimed to explore GPs' experiences of time when delivering 'talking therapy' and to analyse how time influenced the treatment of emotional problems in routine consultations. A qualitative approach was chosen  the data consisted of interviews with 14 GPs and observation of consecutive consultations in four of the participants' practices. Analysis was made by Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Eleven participants delivered talking therapy  five (therapeutically minded participants) often. Three aspects of time emerged: (1) the chronological time of the schedule; (2) the inner time with another rhythm and flow of thought; (3) the longitudinal time where meeting repeatedly for short consultations promoted a trusting relationship where problems were disclosed gradually and a narrative was created. With therapeutic participants the same aspects of time could be identified in routine consultations. Stress and a heavy workload counteracted the perception of inner time. Theories of time and narrative from psychotherapeutic thinking could be applied  form links to the unconscious and the narrative time and could possibly be made more explicit in general practice. Awareness of the different time aspects is necessary for improving the treatment of mental health in primary care. Political and organizational willingness to secure the necessary working conditions is  however  equally important for optimal treatment.
Family Practice,,,[Talking therapy as part of the general practitioner's normal working day]. The vast majority of patients with mental disorders are treated in general practice. In Denmark  GPs have received a special payment for delivering >talking therapy< since 1995. However  it has not been described how this service should be used. Reports from the Danish Psychiatric Society and the Danish College of General Practitioners are paving the way for greater involvement of GPs in psychotherapy. The aim of the study was to investigate how GPs perceive that talking therapy could fit into their day-to-day efforts in the clinic. This is a qualitative study which is based on interviews with Danish GPs. The analysis was based on interpretative phenomenological analysis. GPs organized talking therapy very differently and offered it to different extents. The context and conditions differed greatly from those of the secondary health care system  as the treatment was always an extension of a pre-existing doctor-patient relationship. Therapy was only offered if the communication between GP and patient was good beforehand. Talking therapy would not be delivered if the GPs' time conditions did not allow this  and when time was insufficient it was always the emotional area that was forfeited. The introduction of a psychological thinking to the standardised theoretical curriculum of general practice should be considered. There is a need for research into talking therapy and quality-assured training and supervision of GPs.
Gastroenterology,,,High interleukin-6 mRNA expression is a predictor of relapse in colon cancer. To investigate the expression of interleukin-6 (IL6) in colon cancer tissue  and to examine if the risk of relapse is influenced by IL6 expression. Fresh-frozen biopsies from tumor and normal adjacent tissues were taken from patients with colon cancer during surgery and stored at -80 °C. mRNA expression for interleukin-6 was evaluated with reverse transcription real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Survival analyses were carried-out using a Cox competing risk regression model. IL6 mRNA was significantly more highly expressed in tumor tissue compared to normal adjacent tissue (p<0.001). We found no significant association with regard to IL6 expression and histological differentiation or cancer stage. We found a significant association between high IL6 expression and risk of relapse (Hazard Ratio=2.23  95% CI=1.10-4.53; p<0.05)  also when adjusted for clinicopathological characteristics (Hazard Ratio=2.16  95% CI=1.07-4.40; p<0.05). Interleukin-6 is up-regulated in colon cancer tissue at the transcriptional level and is significantly associated with increased risk of relapse.
Epidemiology,,,A nationwide Danish cohort study challenging the categorisation into right-sided and left-sided colon cancer. The categorisation of colon cancer (CC) into right-sided (RCC) and left-sided (LCC) disease may not capture more subtle variances in aetiology and prognosis. In a nationwide study  we investigated differences in clinical characteristics and survival of RCC versus LCC and of the complete range of CC subsites. Prospective nationwide cohort study. The database of the Danish Colorectal Cancer Group (DCCG). 23 487 CC patients. Overall survival (Kaplan-Meier plots) and mortality (HR from Cox proportional hazards regression analysis) according to CC localisation. For adjustment and stratification  we used age  sex  ASA score (the American Society of Anaesthesiologists score)  tumour location and stage  number of lymph nodes harvested at operation  number of lymph nodes with metastases and presence of distant metastases. Patients with RCC had a higher median age at diagnosis (74.3 years) than patients with LCC (71.8 years; p<0.0001). Overall  the proportion of patients who were women increased the closer the tumour site was to the small intestine. Although RCC patients had higher ASA scores than LCC patients (p<0.0001)  the highest ASA scores were observed in patients with cancer in the transverse and descending colon and at both colon flexures. While RCCs overall were more advanced than LCCs (p<0.0001)  the most advanced CCs were those of the descending colon  splenic flexure and caecum. RCC mortality was higher than LCC mortality only during the first 2 years (women: HR 1.13; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.20; men: HR 1.27; 95% CI 1.20 to 1.35)  and relative to mortality from sigmoid CC  the highest mortality was observed from splenic flexure cancer (HR 1.75; 95% CI 1.54 to 2.00). The present data challenge the simple categorisation of CC into RCC and LCC.
Forensic Pathology,,,[Fatal bicycle accidents involving right turning heavy goods vehicles--forensic pathological findings]. The objective of this study was to describe the forensic pathological findings in autopsies of cyclists involved in fatal accidents with right-turning  heavy goods vehicles (HGV). Retrospective analysis based on medico-legal autopsy reports concerning persons involved in fatal traffic accidents in Denmark between 1996 and 2005. Cyclists and moped-riders hit by a right-turning HGV were included. Forensic pathological findings  blood alcohol levels  place of death as well as several traffic parameters were registered. Twenty-five autopsies were included. In 20 cases (80%)  death had occurred instantly. Also in 20 cases (80%)  injuries in at least three body regions were found at autopsy. There were no cases with injuries in only one body region. There were fewest cases with head/neck injuries. In 16 cases  injuries in one or more body regions were so severe as to be described as complete crushing (conquassatio). In traffic accidents involving cyclists and right-turning HGVs  the cyclist is more often run-over rather than merely hit by the HGV. This mechanism of injury is crucial for both the severity and the distribution of injuries. This is reflected in this study by the number of multiple body regions involved  the number of complete crushing injuries and by the number of cases where death had occurred instantly. Future efforts should focus on the prevention of these accidents.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[The treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum with chlorobutanol-caffeine rectal suppositories in Denmark: practice and evidence]. In Denmark chlorobutanol-caffeine rectal suppositories are prescribed by some obstetric departments for the treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum. We have investigated the extent of this use by questionnaire  and we have performed a literature review on the evidence of efficacy and safety. The use of chlorobutanol-caffeine rectal suppositories was reported by 5 out of 28 obstetric departments in Denmark. The literature search revealed that there is very sparse information on chlorobutanol. No evidence was found of safety during pregnancy in humans or efficiency as antiemetic treatment in hyperemesis gravidarum. There is no evidence of the efficacy or safety of chlorobutanol-caffeine suppositories for the treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum.
Telemedicine,,,Economic evaluation of home blood pressure telemonitoring: a randomized controlled trial. The purpose of the present study was to compare the costs of home blood pressure (BP) telemonitoring (HBPM) with the costs of conventional office BP monitoring. In a randomized controlled trial  105 hypertensive patients performed HBPM and 118 patients received usual care with conventional office BP monitoring during 6 months. Costs were quantified from the healthcare perspective. Non-parametric simulations were performed to quantify the uncertainty around the mean estimates and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were made. Systolic and diastolic daytime and night-time ambulatory BP (ABP) were reduced in both groups. The uncertainty around the incremental cost effectiveness ratio point estimates was considerable for both systolic and diastolic ABP. For systolic ABP  the difference in cost effectiveness ratio between the two groups was 256 Danish kroner (DKK)/mmHg [95% uncertainty interval  UI -860 to 4544]. For diastolic ABP  the difference in cost effectiveness ratio between the two groups was 655 DKK/mmHg [95% UI -674 to 69315]. Medication and consultation costs were lowest in the intervention group  but were offset by the cost of the telemonitoring equipment. Cost-effectiveness analysis showed that telemonitoring of home BP was more costly compared with usual monitoring of office BP. The cost-effectiveness result is surrounded with considerable uncertainty.
Telemedicine,,,Health-related quality of life (SF-36) during telemonitoring of home blood pressure in hypertensive patients: a randomized  controlled study. Telemonitoring of home blood pressure (BP) is a new advance in home BP monitoring (HBPM) and has proved effective in improving BP control. The impact of telemedical HBPM on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) has not yet been studied. The purpose of this study is to compare HRQOL using a generic scale (SF-36) in patients with antihypertensive treatment based on telemedical HBPM and in patients with antihypertensive treatment based on conventional monitoring of office BP. Hypertensive patients (n = 223) recruited by general practitioners participated in the study. In the intervention group  antihypertensive treatment was based on telemedical HBPM. In the control group  patients (n = 118) received usual care with office visits to monitor BP. After 6 months  participants filled out SF-36 questionnaires. Patients in the telemonitoring group (T) had higher mean scores in the bodily pain domain than patients in the control group (C)  indicating less pain and interference with activities among telemonitored patients [T: 85.3(20.2)  C: 78.3(26.4)  p = 0.026)]. Patients were more likely to feel their general health had worsened during the last year if antihypertensive treatment was based on conventional office measurements. In the bodily pain domain and health transition scale  scores were slightly better among telemonitored patients compared with control patients.
Telemedicine,,,Blood pressure control during telemonitoring of home blood pressure. A randomized controlled trial during 6 months. To compare the effectiveness of antihypertensive treatment based on telemonitoring of home blood pressure (BP) and conventional monitoring of office BP. Hypertensive patients (n = 236) participated in a randomized  controlled study. In the intervention group  antihypertensive treatment was based on home BP monitoring. BP readings were registered by a PDA and automatically transmitted to a server  by which the patient and doctor could communicate. In the control group  patients received usual care with office visits to adjust antihypertensive treatment as needed. Primary outcome was difference in systolic daytime ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) change between baseline and 6 months. In both groups  systolic daytime ABPM decreased significantly from baseline to follow-up. The decrease in systolic daytime ABPM was -11.9 mmHg in the intervention group and -9.6 mmHg in the control group (mean difference -2.3 [95% CI -6.1 to -1.5]  p = 0.225). The likelihood of daytime ABPM normalization was similar in the two groups [32/113 (28%) vs 46/123 (37%)  p = 0.139]. Antihypertensive treatment based on telemonitoring of home BP was as effective as usual monitoring of office BP with regards to reduction of BP.
Pharmacogenetics,,,Effectiveness of antiepileptic therapy in patients with PCDH19 mutations. PCDH19 mutations cause epilepsy and mental retardation limited to females (EFMR) or Dravet-like syndromes. Especially in the first years of life  epilepsy is known to be highly pharmacoresistant. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of antiepileptic therapy in patients with PCDH19 mutations. We report a retrospective multicenter study of antiepileptic therapy in 58 female patients with PCDH19 mutations and epilepsy aged 2-27 years (mean age 10.6 years). The most effective drugs after 3 months were clobazam and bromide  with a responder rate of 68% and 67%  respectively  where response was defined as seizure reduction of at least 50%. Defining long-term response as the proportion of responders after 12 months of treatment with a given drug in relation to the number of patients treated for at least 3 months  the most effective drugs after 12 months were again bromide and clobazam  with a long-term response of 50% and 43%  respectively. Seventy-four percent of the patients became seizure-free for at least 3 months  47% for at least one year. The most effective drugs in patients with PCDH19 mutations were bromide and clobazam. Although epilepsy in PCDH19 mutations is often pharmacoresistant  three quarters of the patients became seizure-free for at least for 3 months and half of them for at least one year. However  assessing the effectiveness of the drugs is difficult because a possible age-dependent spontaneous seizure remission must be considered.
Pediatrics,,,Lung function after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in children: a longitudinal study in a population-based cohort. Reduction in pulmonary function (PF) has been reported in up to 85% of pediatric patients during the first year after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Our understanding of the etiology for this decrease in lung function is  however  sparse. The aim of this study was to describe PF during follow-up in a population-based pediatric HSCT cohort and to investigate factors in the transplantation process associated with PF decline. A retrospective  population-based  single-center study of HSCT patients spanning 2 decades was performed. Longitudinal changes in PF over time and associations to transplantation-related factors were investigated using a mixed linear model. One hundred thirty patients were included in the longitudinal analysis and observed for a median (range) of 3.3 (.2 to 16.8) years  during which 1084 PF tests were performed. Sixty-two percent of the patients experienced a decline in lung function of more than 10% during the first 3 to 9 months after HSCT. The decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second  forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity and diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide were strongly associated with acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Other factors associated with PF decline were malignant diagnosis  busulfan-based conditioning  patient and donor age  female donor to male recipient  as well as chronic GvHD. Mild to moderate decline in PF is frequent and appears associated with acute GvHD and other parameters that are risk factors for chronic GvHD in children. This indicates that alloreactivity is central in pathogenesis of the decrease in PF that follows HSCT in children.
Epidemiology,,,Subacromial shoulder disorders among baggage handlers: an observational cohort study. To assess the influence of cumulative employment as baggage handler on the risk of incident subacromial shoulder disorders. Baggage handling is characterized by repetitive work primarily consisting of heavy lifting in awkward positions and time pressure. This cohort study is based on the Copenhagen Airport Cohort consisting of unskilled men with employment at Copenhagen Airport and unskilled men with employment in other firms in the Greater Copenhagen area during the period 1990-2012. Only men were included. We followed the cohort in the National Patient Register and Civil Registration System. The primary exposure was cumulative years of employment as a baggage handler  and the primary outcome was diagnoses and surgical treatment of subacromial shoulder disorders. The cohort contained 3396 baggage handlers and 63 909 workers in the reference group. Baggage handlers with longer cumulative years of employment had higher incidence compared to baggage handlers with shorter employment; for example  baggage handlers with 10-19 years of employment had incidence rate ratio of 2.07 (95 % confidence interval  1.27-3.38) compared to baggage handlers with less than 3 years of employment. Spline regression showed an increase in incidence within the first few years after employment whereupon the increased risk remained constant for longer employment. Baggage handlers had increased incidence in younger ages than the reference population. In this large cohort study  we found increased incidence of subacromial shoulder disorders for workers with longer cumulative years of employment. These results support that long-term lifting in awkward positions and time pressure influences the risk of subacromial shoulder disorders.
Pathology  Surgical,,,[Lymph node identification in colorectal cancer specimens cases]. Colorectal carcinoma is one of the most prevalent malignancies in Western countries. Lymph node status is a significant prognosticator. The chance of identifying node-positivity is positively correlated with the number of lymph nodes (LN) identified. The present paper discusses various variables that may influence the detection of LNs  including patient- as well as surgeon- and pathologist-related issues. The pathologist-related variable most probably shapes the yield the most. Introduction of guidelines focusing on the most appropriate technique may secure better and more consistent results  and the pathologist's commitment is crucial in this respect.
Telemedicine,,,[Successful prehospital diagnosis secures fast and correct treatment of acute aorta dissection]. Time from symptom onset to final treatment is crucial for survival. We present a case where prehospital diagnosis by the emergency physician in the ambulance was followed by a telemedicine conference and data transfer to the hospital. This was combined with bypassing of the emergency room and direct transfer to the thoracic surgical theatre  and time to treatment was reduced considerably. Obtaining a prehospital diagnosis in time-dependent life-threatening disease as basement for supportive treatment and transfer directly to treatment is very important.
Hematology,,,[The clinical research unit]. The organization and infrastructure of clinical research in Denmark is currently in focus due to an ongoing review of Clinical Science performed by the National Ministry of Health. This review describes the background and philosophy for the integration of clinical research into practice and vice versa. This process is catalyzed by activities within the clinical research unit and the foundation is the clinical databases and biobanks. Understanding these mechanisms is fundamental for the quality of care in the Danish health care system and needs a national supportive strategy.
Periodontics,,,Periodontal changes after surgically assisted rapid maxillary expansion (SARME). The objective of the present study was to evaluate the health status of the periodontal tissue after surgically assisted rapid maxillary expansion (SARME). Periodontal status was assessed after an average of 25 months (range  6-66) in 61 patients who underwent SARME by plaque index  gingival index  probing depth  and probing attachment level. In the maxilla  six measurements were made at the central incisor  second premolar  and first molar. Corresponding measurements were made in the mandible as control. The measurements were estimated and expressed with 95 % confidence interval (CI). Additionally  maxillary occlusal radiographs of the maxillary central incisors were evaluated for signs of root resorption. There was no statistically significant difference between experimental and control teeth with respect to plaque index  probing depth  or attachment level. The gingival index of the maxillary central incisor was significantly higher compared to control (CI 0.175 (0.09-0.26)  p value p < 0.001). External apical root resorption of the anterior maxillary teeth was observed in 36 % of the patients. Within the limitations of a retrospective study  the present study seems to demonstrate that SARME does not affect the health status of the periodontal tissues. However  further randomized long-term studies are needed before final conclusions can be provided.
Surgery  Plastic,,,Importance of mesenchymal stem cells in autologous fat grafting: a systematic review of existing studies. Autologous fat grafting (lipofilling) enables repair and augmentation of soft tissues and is increasingly used both in aesthetic and reconstructive surgery. Autologous fat has several advantages  including biocompatibility  versatility  natural appearance  and low donor site morbidity. The main limitation is unpredictable graft resorption  which ranges from 25%-80%  probably as a result of ischaemia and lack of neoangiogenesis. To obviate these disadvantages  several studies have searched for new ways of increasing the viability of the transplanted tissue. One promising approach has been to enrich the fat graft with adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASC) before transplantation. We have reviewed original studies published on fat transplantation enriched with ASC. We found four murine and three human studies that investigated the subject after a sensitive search of publications. In the human studies  so-called cell assisted lipotransfer (CAL) increased the ASC concentration 2-5 times compared with non-manipulated fat grafts  which caused a questionable improvement in survival of fat grafts  compared with that of traditional lipofilling. In contrast  in two of the murine studies ASC-concentrations were increased 1250 and 6250 times  respectively  by ASC ex vivo expansion  which resulted in considerably improved fat transplant survival as well as quality. This effect of high-level enrichment with ASC is thought to have been caused by paracrine signalling  cellular differentiation  or both. The surgical and tissue handling techniques used in lipofilling are well proved  but the added effect of high-level enrichment with ex vivo expanded ASC still needs to be investigated properly in human lipofilling studies  combined with a thorough follow up and matched control groups. In conclusion  ASC-enriched lipofilling theoretically has the potential for transforming lipofilling from a relatively unpredictable intervention into one in which the resorption rate  quality of tissue  and safety can be predicted  and possibly superior to prosthetic implantation.
General Practice,,,The Danish preventive child health examination should expand on mental health and the well-being of the family. In Denmark  around one in six children has significant somatic  psychological or social health problems  often in combination. The preventive child health examinations have a high participation rate; and they produce significant findings  predominantly concerning the child's physical health. The aim of this study was to explore how the child's physical  cognitive and psychosocial health are examined and assessed at the health examinations of children aged 0-5 years in general practice. Our study employed observations of the consultations as well as individual interviews. A total of nine doctors from seven clinics participated. We included 21 cases in our study  each consisting of a consultation and subsequent interviews with the child's parents and with the doctor. The examination of the child's physical health and development is an important feature of the health examination. Motor  cognitive  social skills and mental health are assessed globally through observation and communication with the child  and  to a lesser degree  through conversation with the parents. The child health examination rarely has a family perspective  unless the doctor is already aware of problems in the family. The preventive child health examination is an important platform for examination and dialogue concerning a child's health. The physical aspect works well  but there is a need for development of the assessment of the child's mental health and the well-being of the family.

Pharmacogenetics,,,TP53 hotspot mutations are predictive of survival in primary central nervous system lymphoma patients treated with combination chemotherapy. Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is an aggressive variant of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) confined to the CNS. TP53 mutations (MUT-TP53) were investigated in the context of MIR34A/B/C- and DAPK promoter methylation status  and associated with clinical outcomes in PCNSL patients. In a total of 107 PCNSL patients clinical data were recorded  histopathology reassessed  and genetic and epigenetic aberrations of the p53-miR34-DAPK network studied. TP53 mutational status (exon 5-8)  with structural classification of single nucleotide variations according to the IARC-TP53-Database  methylation status of MIR34A/B/C and DAPK  and p53-protein expression were assessed. The 57/107 (53.2 %) patients that were treated with combination chemotherapy +/- rituximab (CCT-treated) had a significantly better median overall survival (OS) (31.3 months) than patients treated with other regimens (high-dose methotrexate/whole brain radiation therapy  6.0 months  or no therapy  0.83 months)  P < 0.0001. TP53 mutations were identified in 32/86 (37.2 %)  among which 12 patients had hotspot/direct DNA contact mutations. CCT-treated patients with PCNSL harboring a hotspot/direct DNA contact MUT-TP53 (n = 9) had a significantly worse OS and progression free survival (PFS) compared to patients with non-hotspot/non-direct DNA contact MUT-TP53 or wild-type TP53 (median PFS 4.6 versus 18.2 or 45.7 months)  P = 0.041 and P = 0.00076  respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed that hotspot/direct DNA contact MUT-TP53 was predictive of poor outcome in CCT-treated PCNSL patients  P = 0.012 and P = 0.008; HR: 1.86 and 1.95  for OS and PFS  respectively. MIR34A  MIR34B/C  and DAPK promoter methylation were detected in 53/93 (57.0 %)  80/84 (95.2 %)  and 70/75 (93.3 %) of the PCNSL patients with no influence on survival. Combined MUT-TP53 and MIR34A methylation was associated with poor PFS (median 6.4 versus 38.0 months)  P = 0.0070. This study suggests that disruption of the p53-pathway by MUT-TP53in hotspot/direct DNA contact codons is predictive of outcome in CCT-treated PCNSL patients  and concomitant MUT-TP53 and MIR34A methylation are associated with poor PFS.
Geriatrics,Occupational Therapy,,Prevention of low back pain and its consequences among nurses' aides in elderly care: a stepped-wedge multi-faceted cluster-randomized controlled trial. A high prevalence of low back pain has persisted over the years despite extensive primary prevention initiatives among nurses' aides. Many single-faceted interventions addressing just one aspect of low back pain have been carried out at workplaces  but with low success rate. This may be due to the multi-factorial origin of low back pain. Participatory ergonomics  cognitive behavioral training and physical training have previously shown promising effects on prevention and rehabilitation of low back pain. Therefore  the main aim of this study is to examine whether a multi-faceted workplace intervention consisting of participatory ergonomics  physical training and cognitive behavioral training can prevent low back pain and its consequences among nurses' aides. External resources for the participating workplace and a strong commitment from the management and the organization support the intervention. To overcome implementation barriers within usual randomized controlled trial designed workplace interventions  this study uses a stepped-wedge cluster-randomized controlled trial design with 4 groups. The intervention is delivered to the groups at random along four successive time periods three months apart. The intervention lasts three months and integrates participatory ergonomics  physical training and cognitive behavioral training tailored to the target group. Local physiotherapists and occupational therapists conduct the intervention after having received standardized training. Primary outcomes are low back pain and its consequences measured monthly by text messages up to three months after initiation of the intervention. Intervention effectiveness trials for preventing low back pain and its consequences in workplaces with physically demanding work are few  primarily single-faceted  with strict adherence to a traditional randomized controlled trial design that may hamper implementation and compliance  and have mostly been unsuccessful. By using a stepped wedge design  and obtain high management commitment and support we intend to improve implementation and aim to establish the effectiveness of a multi-faceted intervention to prevent low back pain. This study will potentially provide knowledge of prevention of low back pain and its consequences among nurses' aides. Results are expected to be published in 2015-2016. The study is registered as ISRCTN78113519.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[The usefulness of calcium and vitamin D supplementation after the Women's Health Initiative trial]. Three recently published randomized controlled studies on the effects of calcium and vitamin D on fracture risk from the UK and the USA were critically reviewed. We found problems related to their external validity compromising their transferability to Denmark. Furthermore  study power was limited because of the selection of low-risk patients  problems with compliance and persistence  and supplementation with calcium and vitamin D outside the protocol. Two recent meta-analyses including the three studies supported the continuous use of calcium and vitamin D to prevent fractures in the elderly.
Integrative Medicine,Precision Medicine,,An investigation of multidisciplinary complex health care interventions--steps towards an integrative treatment model in the rehabilitation of people with multiple sclerosis. The Danish Multiple Sclerosis Society initiated a large-scale bridge building and integrative treatment project to take place from 2004-2010 at a specialized Multiple Sclerosis (MS) hospital. In this project  a team of five conventional health care practitioners and five alternative practitioners was set up to work together in developing and offering individualized treatments to 200 people with MS. The purpose of this paper is to present results from the six year treatment collaboration process regarding the development of an integrative treatment model. The collaborative work towards an integrative treatment model for people with MS  involved six steps: 1) Working with an initial model 2) Unfolding the different treatment philosophies 3) Discussing the elements of the Intervention-Mechanism-Context-Outcome-scheme (the IMCO-scheme) 4) Phrasing the common assumptions for an integrative MS program theory 5) Developing the integrative MS program theory 6) Building the integrative MS treatment model. The model includes important elements of the different treatment philosophies represented in the team and thereby describes a common understanding of the complexity of the courses of treatment. An integrative team of practitioners has developed an integrative model for combined treatments of People with Multiple Sclerosis. The model unites different treatment philosophies and focuses on process-oriented factors and the strengthening of the patients' resources and competences on a physical  an emotional and a cognitive level.
Midwifery,Obstetrics,,Curriculum development for a national cardiotocography education program: a Delphi survey to obtain consensus on learning objectives. To define learning objectives for a national cardiotocography (CTG) education program based on expert consensus. A three-round Delphi survey. One midwife and one obstetrician from each maternity unit in Denmark were appointed based on CTG teaching experience and clinical obstetric experience. Following national and international guidelines  the research group determined six topics as important when using CTG: fetal physiology  equipment  indication  interpretation  clinical management  and communication/responsibility. In the first Delphi round  participants listed one to five learning objectives within the predefined topics. Responses were analyzed by a directed approach to content analysis. Phrasing was modified in accordance with Bloom's taxonomy. In the second and third Delphi rounds  participants rated each objective on a five-point relevance scale. Consensus was predefined as objectives with a mean rating value of ≥ 3. A prioritized list of CTG learning objectives. A total of 42 midwives and obstetricians from 21 maternity units were invited to participate  of whom 26 completed all three Delphi rounds  representing 18 maternity units. The final prioritized list included 40 objectives. The highest ranked objectives emphasized CTG interpretation and clinical management. The lowest ranked objectives emphasized fetal physiology. Mean ratings of relevance ranged from 3.15 to 5.00. National consensus on CTG learning objectives was achieved using the Delphi methodology. This was an initial step in developing a valid CTG education program. A prioritized list of objectives will clarify which topics to emphasize in a CTG education program.
Midwifery,Obstetrics,,Recommendations of activity restriction in high-risk pregnancy scenarios: a Danish national survey. To describe specific recommendations of activity restriction  place of care  expected beneficial and adverse effects  and recommended antithrombotic prophylaxis in nine clinical scenarios. A national survey. All members of the Danish Society of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and the Danish Association of Midwives were asked to complete a tested  structured questionnaire. We sent 1815 invitations; the overall response rate was 54%. A majority of clinicians recommended some form of activity restriction in the nine scenarios. The midwives recommended strict or moderate activity restriction more often than obstetricians in five of the nine scenarios  in women with preterm premature rupture of membranes  preterm labour  cervical ripening  total placenta praevia  and intrauterine growth restriction  whereas no differences were found in the remaining scenarios. Compared to the obstetricians  the midwives also reported that they expected the recommendation to be more effective. Most midwives and obstetricians reported that they thought strict activity restriction was associated with severe or moderate adverse effect  and recommended antithrombotic prophylaxis. Danish obstetricians and midwives prescribe activity restriction in most high-risk pregnancies. The degree of activity restriction and the presumed effect vary between clinicians. This may reflect different attitudes and lack of guidelines based on clinical studies of a possible benefit of activity restriction.
Psychiatry,,,Neurodevelopmental disorders associated with dosage imbalance of ZBTB20 correlate with the morbidity spectrum of ZBTB20 candidate target genes. Recently  a number of patients have been described with structural rearrangements at 3q13.31  delineating a novel microdeletion syndrome with common clinical features including developmental delay and other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). A smallest region of overlapping deletions (SRO) involved five RefSeq genes  including the transcription factor gene ZBTB20 and the dopamine receptor gene DRD3  considered as candidate genes for the syndrome. We used array comparative genomic hybridization and next-generation mate-pair sequencing to identify key structural rearrangements involving ZBTB20 in two patients with NDD. In a patient with developmental delay  attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder  psychosis  Tourette's syndrome and autistic traits  a de novo balanced t(3;18) translocation truncated ZBTB20. The other breakpoint did not disrupt any gene. In a second patient with developmental delay and autism  we detected the first microdeletion at 3q13.31  which truncated ZBTB20 but did not involve DRD3 or the other genes within the previously defined SRO. Zbtb20 directly represses 346 genes in the developing murine brain. Of the 342 human orthologous ZBTB20 candidate target genes  we found 68 associated with NDD. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative PCR  we validated the in vivo binding of Zbtb20 in evolutionary conserved regions in six of these genes (Cntn4  Gad1  Nrxn1  Nrxn3  Scn2a  Snap25). Our study links dosage imbalance of ZBTB20 to a range of neurodevelopmental  cognitive and psychiatric disorders  likely mediated by dysregulation of multiple ZBTB20 target genes  and provides new knowledge on the genetic background of the NDD seen in the 3q13.31 microdeletion syndrome.
Precision Medicine,,,Towards individualized follow-up in adult acute myeloid leukemia in remission. An increasing body of data has demonstrated that the traditional concept of morphologic complete remission in acute myeloid leukemia  in which less than 5% myeloblasts is regarded as a sufficient response criterion  is not biologically sound. Fortunately  the quantitative reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method seems to be a promising alternative because of its high degree of preclinical standardization and extreme sensitivity on the background of an accurate day-to-day estimate of sample quality. Widespread implementation of this has  however  to some extent been hampered by the lack of knowledge of how and when to measure minimal residual disease levels and  even more importantly  how to react preemptively on a molecular relapse defined by a PCR reversal. Thus  only few prospective studies have been published to date to clinically validate this assay. Here  we discuss outstanding issues in the clinical implementation of RT-PCR for fusion transcripts  mutated and overexpressed genes in acute myeloid leukemia patients in complete remission  and propose a set of guidelines  which can be used when designing prospective trials aimed at validating the use of RT-PCR as well as for following these patients based on mathematical models for disease recurrence recently developed in our laboratory.
Dermatology,Evidence-Based Medicine,,Evidence-based Danish guidelines for the treatment of Malassezia-related skin diseases. Internationally approved guidelines for the diagnosis and management of Malassezia-related skin diseases are lacking. Therefore  a panel of experts consisting of dermatologists and a microbiologist under the auspices of the Danish Society of Dermatology undertook a data review and compiled guidelines for the diagnostic procedures and management of pityriasis versicolor  seborrhoeic dermatitis and Malassezia folliculitis. Main recommendations in most cases of pityriasis versicolor and seborrhoeic dermatitis include topical treatment which has been shown to be sufficient. As first choice  treatment should be based on topical antifungal medication. A short course of topical corticosteroid or topical calcineurin inhibitors has an anti-inflammatory effect in seborrhoeic dermatitis. Systemic antifungal therapy may be indicated for widespread lesions or lesions refractory to topical treatment. Maintenance therapy is often necessary to prevent relapses. In the treatment of Malassezia folliculitis systemic antifungal treatment is probably more effective than topical treatment but a combination may be favourable.
Pediatrics,,,Syngeneic transplantation in aplastic anemia: pre-transplant conditioning and peripheral blood are associated with improved engraftment: an observational study on behalf of the Severe Aplastic Anemia and Pediatric Diseases Working Parties of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation. Aplastic anemia is usually treated with immunosuppression or allogeneic transplant  depending on patient and disease characteristics. Syngeneic transplant offers a rare treatment opportunity with minimal transplant-related mortality  and offers an insight into disease mechanisms. We present here a retrospective analysis of all syngeneic transplants for aplastic anemia reported to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation. Between 1976 and 2009  88 patients received 113 transplants. Most transplants (n=85) were preceded by a conditioning regimen  22 of these including anti-thymocyte globulin. About half of transplants with data available (39 of 86) were followed by posttransplant immunosuppression. Graft source was bone marrow in the majority of cases (n=77). Transplant practice changed over time with more transplants with conditioning and anti-thymocyte globulin as well as peripheral blood stem cells performed in later years. Ten year overall survival was 93% with 5 transplant-related deaths. Graft failure occurred in 32% of transplants. Risk of graft failure was significantly increased in transplants without conditioning  and with bone marrow as graft source. Lack of posttransplant immunosuppression also showed a trend towards increased risk of graft failure  while anti-thymocyte globulin did not have an influence. In summary  syngeneic transplant is associated with a significant risk of graft failure when no conditioning is given  but has an excellent long-term outcome. Furthermore  our comparatively large series enables us to recommend the use of pre-transplant conditioning rather than not and possibly to prefer peripheral blood as a stem cell source.
Hematology,,,Diagnostic and therapeutic lumbar puncture performed safely and efficiently with a thin blunt needle. The risk of postdural puncture headache following lumbar puncture can be reduced by choosing a blunt spinal needle or by using a smaller needle diameter. Reports indicate that lumbar puncture practiced outside of the anaesthetic discipline does not adhere to the current level of evidence. To examine the practice among haematologists in Denmark  we performed a national survey. In addition  we analysed the flow rate of a blunt 27-gauge (0.4 mm) spinal needle typically used for spinal anaesthesia by timing the tap duration of a diagnostic lumbar puncture. An online survey was emailed to all twelve haematology departments in Denmark with questions regarding needle type and technique. A total of 64 patients undergoing lumbar puncture with a 27-gauge spinal needle (sitting position) had their sampling of 6 ml cerebrospinal fluid timed with a stopwatch. Eleven sites participated. Only three (27%) reported routine use of blunt needles. Five (45%) departments used a large calibre needle (18-20 gauge; 1.2-0.9 mm)  while the remaining six (55%) used smaller calibre needles (≥ 22-gauge; ≤ 0.7 mm). The mean sampling time was 11 min. 59 sec.  which corresponds to a flow rate of 30 ml/h. There is strong evidence in favour of the use of blunt spinal needles to reduce the risk of postdural puncture headache. In general  lumbar puncture practice among the haematologists in Denmark does not adhere to the literature's recommendations. The risk of headache may further be reduced by using a thin needle  even if this prolongs sampling time. not relevant. not relevant.
Family Practice,,,[Use of dipsticks and microscope in the diagnosis of hematuria in general practice]. Haematuria is a serious symptom and is often detected by dipstick analysis. We examined the use of dipsticks in general practice. An anonymous questionnaire was sent to all GPs in a county in Denmark in April 2000. The response rate was 92%. All GPs used dipsticks for the detection of haematuria. Answers to the questionnaire were compared with the guidelines of the dipstick manufacturers  and we found that 80% handled the dipstick incorrectly. A microscope was available in 65% of practices  and 44% performed urine microscopy in the case of dipstick haematuria. The validity of dipsticks in the detection of haematuria is discussed  and we conclude that dipsticks must be handled strictly in accordance with the instructions of the manufacturer  so as to maintain a high rate of specificity and sensitivity. A positive dipstick should be followed up immediately with microscopy of the same urine sample.
Pulmonary Medicine,,,Report of the European Respiratory Society/European Cystic Fibrosis Society task force on the care of adults with cystic fibrosis. The improved survival in people with cystic fibrosis has led to an increasing number of patients reaching adulthood. This trend is likely to be maintained over the next decades  suggesting a need to increase the number of centres with expertise in the management of adult patients with cystic fibrosis. These centres should be capable of delivering multidisciplinary care addressing the complexity of the disease  in addition to addressing the psychological burden on patients and their families. Further issues that require attention are organ transplantation and end of life management.Lung disease in adults with cystic fibrosis drives most of the clinical care requirements  and major life-threatening complications  such as respiratory infection  respiratory failure  pneumothorax and haemoptysis  and the management of lung transplantation require expertise from trained respiratory physicians. The taskforce therefore strongly reccommends that medical leadership in multidisciplinary adult teams should be attributed to a respiratory physician adequately trained in cystic fibrosis management.The task force suggests the implementation of a core curriculum for trainees in adult respiratory medicine and the selection and accreditation of training centres that deliver postgraduate training to the standards of the HERMES programme.
Pulmonary Medicine,,,Future trends in cystic fibrosis demography in 34 European countries. Median survival has increased in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) during the past six decades  which has led to an increased number of adults with CF. The future impact of changes in CF demographics has not been evaluated. The aim of this study was to estimate the number of children and adults with CF in 34 European countries by 2025. Data were obtained from the European Cystic Fibrosis Society Patient Registry. Population forecasts were performed for countries that have extensive CF population coverage and at least 4 years of longitudinal data by modelling future entering and exiting flows in registry cohorts. For the other countries  population projections were performed based on assumptions from knowledge of current CF epidemiology. Western European countries' forecasts indicate that an increase in the overall number of CF patients by 2025  by approximately 50%  corresponds to an increase by 20% and by 75% in children and adults  respectively. In Eastern European countries the projections suggest a predominant increase in the CF child population  although the CF adult population would also increase.It was concluded that a large increase in the adult CF population is expected in the next decade. A significant increase in adult CF services throughout Europe is urgently required.
Precision Medicine,Psychiatry,,Operationalizing NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) in naturalistic clinical settings. Recently  the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) introduced the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative to address two major challenges facing the field of psychiatry: (1) the lack of new effective personalized treatments for psychiatric disorders  and (2) the limitations associated with categorically defined psychiatric disorders. Although the potential of RDoC to revolutionize personalized psychiatric medicine and psychiatric nosology has been acknowledged  it is unclear how to implement RDoC in naturalistic clinical settings as part of routine outcomes research. In this article  the authors present the major RDoC principles and then show how these principles are operationalized in The Menninger Clinic's McNair Initiative for Neuroscience Discovery-Menninger & Baylor College of Medicine (MIND-MB) study. The authors discuss how RDoC-informed outcomes-based assessment in clinical settings can transform personalized clinical care through multimodal treatments.
Adolescent Psychiatry,Child Psychiatry,,The use of antipsychotic medication in child and adolescent psychiatric treatment in Denmark. A cross-sectional survey. The number of children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders being treated with antipsychotic medication is increasing significantly; however  only a limited evidence-base is available on this topic  especially when children are concerned. This study reports and discusses the use of antipsychotic medication in children and adolescents below 19 years of age in Denmark. A national cross-sectional survey registered the use of antipsychotic drugs on a given date. A questionnaire was sent to all child and adolescent psychiatric departments and all consultants in child and adolescent psychiatry throughout the country. All children and adolescents  aged 0-18 years  registered in treatment with antipsychotic medication  were included. Sixty-seven per cent of clinics and 63% of consultants participated. The total number of subjects registered in examination or treatment in the participating units was 3854. Antipsychotic medication was used in n=244 (6.4%) of these cases. Eighty-eight patients received additional medication  of which 24% received antidepressants  8% sedative medication and 4% psychostimulants. The age of the patients was 4-18 years  and 63% was male. The most frequent diagnoses for patients in antipsychotic treatment were: schizophrenia  schizotypal disorder  autism spectrum disorders and personality disorders. Monotherapy was used in 87% of cases. Sixty-four per cent of patients treated with antipsychotics  received a second-generation antipsychotic as the main treatment. All 244 patients received one or more additional treatment modalities other than medication. Antipsychotic medication has a definite role in the treatment of children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders. Second-generation antipsychotics used as monotherapy prevail.
Internal Medicine,,,[Appropriate use of hospital days in medical wards]. This study evaluated the incidence of inappropriate use of bed days in Danish medical wards using the European Appropriateness Evaluation Protocol (AEP). Several European countries have used the AEP to assess the appropriateness of hospitalisation days. The study was carried out in four Danish medical wards from October 2004 to January 2005. On pre-selected days a doctor and nurse performed case record analyses of all hospitalised patients with registration of the AEP criteria. To assess activities during the entire day  the screening comprised activities from the previous day. Altogether  738 patients were reviewed. On average  32.1% of hospitalisation days on the four wards were assessed as inappropriate (range 19.2-39.2%). Lack of alternative facilities (different outpatient services  rehabilitation  home nursing  etc.) and internal waiting time for diagnostic tests were the most common causes of inappropriate bed use. 6.4% of bed days were considered appropriate from a clinical point of view even though no AEP criteria were met. In order to reduce the number of inappropriate hospital days  it is necessary to optimise the cooperation with the primary health care sector and ensure immediate availability of diagnostic tests.
Molecular Epidemiology,,,[Genetic epidemiology--from gene to disease understanding]. Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the aetiology of many common diseases. Recently  progress has been made in the identification of susceptibility genes by candidate gene and genome-wide association studies. Thereby  a further molecular understanding of pathophysiological pathways has been obtained and the development of new therapeutic modalities based on rational drug design has been initiated. However  a host of methods and approaches are necessary to further increase the knowledge on the aetiology of the complex diseases.
Epidemiology,,,Epidemiology of Fractures in Diabetes. Diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk of fracture. The risk of a hip fracture is up to sevenfold increased in patients with type 1 diabetes and about 1.3-fold increased in patients with type 2 diabetes. However  these relative risk estimates may depend on the age and gender distribution of the population in question. Bone mineral density and the fracture risk assessment tool do not explain the increased fracture risk in patients with diabetes. Shared risk factors as pancreatitis  alcohol use  smoking and oral glucocorticoids may influence the observed fracture risk in patients with diabetes. This review examines the association between diabetes and fracture and attempts to disentangle the tight connection between diabetes per se  diabetes-related complications  comorbidities and shared risk factors. This is of great importance as the number of diabetes patients' increases with growing and aging populations and putting even more at risk of fracture.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[The influence of allergic rhinitis on asthma]. Allergic rhinitis presents as intermittent or persistent nasal symptoms with sneeze  blockage and secretions. Rhinitis affects more that 20% of the population and is more frequent in younger persons. Allergic rhinitis influences all aspects of quality of life  school performance and work. Most asthmatics suffer from rhinitis and many rhinitis patients suffer from asthma. Patients with rhinitis should be evaluated for asthma and patients with asthma should be evaluated for rhinitis. A combined strategy should be applied in the treatment of upper and lower airways.
Nursing Methodology Research,,,Identifying transitions in terminal illness trajectories: a critical factor in hospital-based palliative care. This article describes the significance of the identification and explicit communication of the different clinical phases in incurable illness trajectories in a hospital setting. The article is part of a qualitative study carried out in a Danish haematology department. The data were obtained through a total of 157 hours of participant observation and informal interviews with patients  families  doctors and nurses and four focus group interviews with doctors and nursing staff. Grounded theory was applied for the data analysis. The findings outline how the unpredictability of certain haematological malignancies and barriers in professional practice tended to postpone identifications of transitions between clinical phases. The study has identified ten barriers including personal  professional  time-related  cultural and organizational-for an open dialogue between staff  patients and families about illness progression. The quality of palliative care was affected as different clinical phases require different treatment and care strategies. Complex intervention is called for.
Epidemiology,Psychiatry,,Risk factors of coercion among psychiatric inpatients: a nationwide register-based cohort study. Reducing the use of coercion among patients with mental disorders has long been a political priority. However  risk factors for coercive measures have primarily been investigated in smaller studies. To reduce the use of coercion  it is crucial to identify people at risk which we aim to do in this first large-scale study. A cohort study was conducted among all psychiatric inpatients in Denmark  following 112 233 individuals during 1999-2014. Data from Danish registers were analysed using logistic regression for repeated measures. 24 594 inpatients were exposed to a coercive measure (21.9%). Clinical characteristics were the foremost predictors of coercion and patients with organic mental disorder had the highest increased risk of being subjected to a coercive measure (OR = 5.56; 95% CI = 5.04  6.14). The risk of coercion was the highest in the first admission and decreased with the number of admissions (all p < 0.001). The following socioeconomic variables were associated with an increased risk of coercion: male sex  unemployment  lower social class and immigrants from low and middle income countries (all p < 0.001). Early retirement and social relations  such as being married and having children  reduced the risk of being subjected to coercive measure (all p < 0.05). From our nationwide data  we identified a broad range of risk factors associated with coercive measures. Our findings can assist researchers in identifying patients at risk of coercion and thereby help targeting new coercion reduction programs.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Chronic left heart failure. A focus on the pathogenetic basis of medical treatment]. Chronic left heart failure is the result of the activation of pathophysiological mechanisms which over time lead to progressive deterioration of the cardiac function. As pharmacotherapy aims at these mechanisms and as treatment possibilities are increasing  we find it relevant to provide a survey. Treatment evidence is based mainly on systolic dysfunction. It consists of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor  aldosterone antagonist  beta-blocker  digoxin and diuretics. Incorporation of evidence-based medicine and treatment of diastolic dysfunction should be focussed on in the future.
Nutrigenomics,Nutritional Sciences,,Molecular nutrition research: the modern way of performing nutritional science. In spite of amazing progress in food supply and nutritional science  and a striking increase in life expectancy of approximately 2.5 months per year in many countries during the previous 150 years  modern nutritional research has a great potential of still contributing to improved health for future generations  granted that the revolutions in molecular and systems technologies are applied to nutritional questions. Descriptive and mechanistic studies using state of the art epidemiology  food intake registration  genomics with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and epigenomics  transcriptomics  proteomics  metabolomics  advanced biostatistics  imaging  calorimetry  cell biology  challenge tests (meals  exercise  etc.)  and integration of all data by systems biology  will provide insight on a much higher level than today in a field we may name molecular nutrition research. To take advantage of all the new technologies scientists should develop international collaboration and gather data in large open access databases like the suggested Nutritional Phenotype database (dbNP). This collaboration will promote standardization of procedures (SOP)  and provide a possibility to use collected data in future research projects. The ultimate goals of future nutritional research are to understand the detailed mechanisms of action for how nutrients/foods interact with the body and thereby enhance health and treat diet-related diseases.
Orthopedics,,,Nursing intervention by telephone interviews of patients aged over 65 years after total hip replacement improves health status: a randomised clinical trial. We hypothesised that all areas of health status after total hip replacement could be improved in patients aged over 65 years and over by using telephone support and counselling 2 and 10 weeks after surgery compared with a control group receiving conventional care and treatment. A randomised clinical trial focusing on patients' health status by using short-form 36 at 4 weeks preoperatively and 3 and 9 months postoperatively was carried out. 180 patients aged 65 years and over were randomised 4 weeks preoperatively to either control or intervention groups. both groups received conventional surgical treatment  but the intervention group was interviewed by telephone 2 and 10 weeks after surgery. Patients were given counselling within eight main dimensions with reference to their postoperative situation. All patients experienced improvement in health status. The intervention significantly reduced the time patients needed to reach their habitual levels in three of eight areas of their health status: the intervention patients reached their habitual levels at 3 months whereas the control patients reached theirs after 9 months. Intervention by telephone support and counselling in the postoperative phase seems to benefit patients' improvement in health status.
Toxicology,,,A Multilaboratory Toxicological Assessment of a Panel of 10 Engineered Nanomaterials to Human Health--ENPRA Project--The Highlights  Limitations  and Current and Future Challenges. ENPRA was one of the earlier multidisciplinary European Commission FP7-funded projects aiming to evaluate the risks associated with nanomaterial (NM) exposure on human health across pulmonary  cardiovascular  hepatic  renal  and developmental systems. The outputs from this project have formed the basis of this review. A retrospective interpretation of the findings across a wide range of in vitro and in vivo studies was performed to identify the main highlights from the project. In particular  focus was placed on informing what advances were made in the hazard assessment of NM  as well as offering some suggestions on the future of "nanotoxicology research" based on these observations  shortcomings  and lessons learned from the project. A number of issues related to the hazard assessment of NM are discussed in detail and include use of appropriate NM for nanotoxicology investigations; characterization and dispersion of NM; use of appropriate doses for all related investigations; need for the correct choice of experimental models for risk assessment purposes; and full understanding of the test systems and correct interpretation of data generated from in vitro and in vivo systems. It is hoped that this review may assist in providing information in the implementation of guidelines  model systems  validation of assessment methodology  and integrated testing approaches for risk assessment of NM. It is vital to learn from ongoing and/or completed studies to avoid unnecessary duplication and offer suggestions that might improve different aspects of experimental design.
Toxicology,,,Engineered nanomaterial risk. Lessons learnt from completed nanotoxicology studies: potential solutions to current and future challenges. PARTICLE_RISK was one of the first multidisciplinary projects funded by the European Commission's Framework Programme that was responsible for evaluating the implications of nanomaterial (NM) exposure on human health. This project was the basis for this review which identifies the challenges that exist within the assessment of NM risk. We have retrospectively reflected on the findings of completed nanotoxicology studies to consider what progress and advances have been made within the risk assessment of NMs  as well as discussing the direction that nanotoxicology research is taking and identifying the limitations and failings of existing research. We have reflected on what commonly encountered challenges exist and explored how these issues may be resolved. In particular  the following is discussed (i) NM selection (ii) NM physico-chemical characterisation; (iii) NM dispersion; (iv) selection of relevant doses and concentrations; (v) identification of relevant models  target sites and endpoints; (vi) development of alternatives to animal testing; and (vii) NM risk assessment. These knowledge gaps are relatively well recognised by the scientific community and recommendations as to how they may be overcome in the future are provided. It is hoped that this will help develop better defined hypothesis driven research in the future that will enable comprehensive risk assessments to be conducted for NMs. Importantly  the nanotoxicology community has responded and adapted to advances in knowledge over recent years to improve the approaches used to assess NM hazard  exposure and risk. It is vital to learn from existing information provided by ongoing or completed studies to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort  and to offer guidance on aspects of the experimental design that should be carefully considered prior to the start of a new study.
Pharmacoepidemiology,,,Early glycaemic control in metformin users receiving their first add-on therapy: a population-based study of 4 734 people with type 2 diabetes. The aims of this work were to assess glycaemic control in metformin users receiving their first add-on glucose-lowering therapy and to examine the real-life effectiveness of different add-on drugs. We carried out a population-based cohort study using healthcare databases in northern Denmark during 2000-2012. We included 4 734 persons who initiated metformin monotherapy and added another glucose-lowering drug within 3 years. Attainment of recommended HbA1c goals within 6 months of add-on was investigated  using Poisson regression analysis adjusted for age  sex  baseline HbA(1c)  diabetes duration  complications and Charlson Comorbidity Index. Median metformin treatment duration at intensification was 12 months (interquartile range [IQR] 4-23 months) and pre-intensification HbA(1c) was 8.0% (IQR 7.2-9.2%) (64 [IQR 55-77] mmol/mol). Median HbA(1c) dropped 1.2% (13 mmol/mol) with a sulfonylurea (SU) add-on  0.8% (9 mmol/mol) with a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor  1.3% (14 mmol/mol) with a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist  0.9% (10 mmol/mol) with other non-insulin drugs and 2.4% (26 mmol/mol) with insulin. Compared with SU add-on  attainment of HbA(1c) <7% (<53 mmol/mol) was higher with GLP-1 receptor agonists (adjusted RR [aRR] 1.10; 95% CI 1.01  1.19) and lower with DPP-4 inhibitors (aRR 0.94; 95% CI 0.89  0.99)  other drugs (aRR 0.86; 95% CI 0.77  0.96) and insulin (aRR 0.88; 95% CI 0.77  0.99). The proportion of metformin add-on users who attained HbA(1c) <7% (<53 mmol/mol) increased from 46% in 2000-2003 to 59% in 2010-2012  whereas attainment of HbA(1c) <6.5% (<48 mmol/mol) remained 30% among patients aged <65 years without comorbidities. Among early type 2 diabetes patients receiving their first metformin add-on treatment  HbA(1c) reduction with different non-insulin drugs is similar to  and comparable with  that observed in randomised trials  yet 41% do not achieve HbA(1c) <7% (<53 mmol/mol) within 6 months.
Sports Medicine,,,Novel stretch-sensor technology allows quantification of adherence and quality of home-exercises: a validation study. To investigate if a new stretch sensor attached to an elastic exercise band can assist health professionals in evaluating adherence to home exercises. More specifically  the study investigated whether health professionals can differentiate elastic band exercises performed as prescribed  from exercises not performed as prescribed. 10 participants performed four different shoulder-abduction exercises in two rounds (80 exercise scenarios in total). The scenarios were (1) low contraction speed  full range of motion (0-90°)  (2) high contraction speed  full range of motion (0-90°)  (3) low contraction speed  diminished range of motion (0-45°) and (4) unsystematic pull of the elastic exercise band. Stretch-sensor readings from each participant were recorded and presented randomly to the raters. Two raters were asked to differentiate between unsystematic pull (scenario 4)  from shoulder abduction strength exercises (scenarios 1-3). The next two raters were asked to identify the four different exercise scenarios (scenarios 1-4). The first two raters were able to differentiate between unsystematic pull (scenario 4) from shoulder abduction strength exercises (scenarios 1-3). They made no errors (100% success rate). The second two raters were both able to identify each of the 80 scenarios (scenarios 1-4). They too made no errors (100% success rate). The stretch-sensor readings from the elastic exercise band allow health professionals to quantify whether strength-exercises have been performed as prescribed. These findings have great implications for future clinical practice and research where home exercises are the drugs-of-choice  as they enable clinicians and researchers to measure the exact adherence and quality of the prescribed exercises.
Gastroenterology,,,Telephone reminders reduced the non-attendance rate in a gastroenterology outpatient clinic. Non-attendance is a global health-care problem. The aim of the present study was 1) to investigate if a telephone reminder could reduce the non-attendance rate  2) to study reasons for non-attendance and 3) to evaluate if a permanent implementation would be economically advantageous in a gastroenterology outpatient clinic like ours. This was a comparative intervention study with a historical control group in a gastroenterology outpatient clinic. The study lasted six months. Patients with a scheduled appointment in the first three-month period received no reminder (control group  n = 2 705). Patients in the following three-month period were reminded by telephone one weekday in advance of their appointment  when possible (intervention group  n = 2 479). Non-attending patients in the intervention group received a questionnaire. Based on the results  a financial cost-benefit analysis was made. In the intervention group  1 577 (64%) patients answered the reminder telephone call. The non-attendance rate was significantly lower in the intervention group (6.1%) than in the control group (10.5%) (p < 0.00001). Only 1.3% of the patients who answered the reminder turned out to be non-attendees. The most common explanation for non-attendance in the intervention group was forgetfulness (39%). The reminder telephone call was cost-effective. In this outpatient clinic  telephone reminders were cost-effective and significantly reduced the non-attendance rate by 43%.
Medical Oncology,Neurology,Surgical Oncology,The Danish Neuro-Oncology Registry: establishment  completeness and validity. The Danish Neuro-Oncology Registry (DNOR) is a nationwide clinical cancer database that has prospectively registered data on patients with gliomas since January 2009. The purpose of this study was to describe the establishment of the DNOR and further to evaluate the database completeness of patient registration and validity of data. The completeness of the number of patients registered in the database was evaluated in the study period from January 2009 through December 2014 by comparing cases reported to the DNOR with the Danish National Patient Registry and the Danish Pathology Registry. The data validity of important clinical variables was evaluated by a random sample of 100 patients from the DNOR using the medical records as reference. A total of 2241 patients were registered in the DNOR by December 2014 with an overall patient completeness of 92 %  which increased during the study period (from 78 % in 2009 to 96 % in 2014). Medical records were available for all patients in the validity analyses. Most variables showed a high agreement proportion (56-100 %)  with a fair to good chance-corrected agreement (k = 0.43-1.0). The completeness of patient registration was very high (92 %) and the validity of the most important patient data was good. The DNOR is a newly established national database  which is a reliable source for future scientific studies and clinical quality assessments among patients with gliomas.
Neurology,,,Off-hours admission and acute stroke care quality: a nationwide study of performance measures and case-fatality. Studies have reported higher risks of death and other adverse outcomes in acute stroke patients admitted off-hours; however  little is known about the underlying mechanisms. According to time of admission  our aim was to examine compliance with performance measures for acute stroke care processes  including the effect of a systematic quality improvement program  and to examine 30 days case-fatality. A population-based historical cohort study  including patients admitted to Danish hospitals with a first ever acute stroke (January 1  2003  to December 31  2011; N=64 975). Off-hours were weekends and evening and nighttime shifts on weekdays. Compliance with performance measures was compared using general linear modeling  and odds ratios for 30 days case-fatality were obtained using multivariable logistic regression. Patients admitted off-hours had a lower chance of compliance with 8 out of 10 performance measures; however  these differences diminished over time. Unadjusted odds ratio for 30 days case-fatality  for patients admitted off-hours compared with patients admitted on-hours  was 1.15 (95% confidence interval  1.09-1.21). Adjusting for patient characteristics (in particular  stroke severity) decreased the odds ratio to 1.03 (95% confidence interval  0.97-1.10). Additional adjustment for hospital characteristics and compliance with performance measures had no effect on the odds ratio. Patients admitted off-hours received a poorer quality of care. However  the admission time-related differences in care were substantially reduced over time  and the differences in 30 days case-fatality appeared primarily to be explained by differences in stroke severity.
Epidemiology,,,The incidence of ulcerative colitis (1995-2011) and Crohn's disease (1995-2012) - based on nationwide Danish registry data. The incidence of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) has increased during the 20th century in North America and Western Europe. However  there are conflicting reports whether the incidence has declined  stabilized or even continued to increase. No nationwide Danish data on the incidence of UC and CD exist after 1992  and therefore we studied the incidence of UC (1995 through 2011) and CD (1995 through 2012). Based on data from the Danish National Patient Registry we identified patients recorded with a first time diagnosis of UC or CD in the study periods. Among these - patients were only included in the study as incident cases if they had at least one more discharge diagnosis of UC/CD or at least three subsequent outpatient visits. We identified 17 500 patients with UC and 7863 patients with CD. The mean incidence rate for UC in 1995-1998 was 14.4 per 100 000 per year for women and 13.8 for men  increasing to 23.2 per 100 000 per year for women and 23.4 for men in the period of 2009-2011. The mean incidence rate for CD in 1995-1998 was 7.8 per 100 000 per year for women and 5.6 for men  increasing to 10.3 per 100 000 per year for women and 8.9 for men in the period of 2009-2012. Based on nationwide Danish data from the last two decades  the incidence rates of UC and CD have continued to increase.
Pharmacoepidemiology,,,Birth outcome in women with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease  and pharmacoepidemiological aspects of anti-inflammatory drug therapy. The clinical epidemiological studies included in this thesis fall into three parts. The first part includes studies on birth outcome in women with ulcerative colitis. The second part includes pharmacoepidemiological studies on birth outcome after anti-inflammatory drug therapy in pregnancy  including patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. The third part (and the latest publications) includes birth outcome in women with Crohn's disease; and the methods of cohort establishment in these studies are developed and improved due to the knowledge gathered from conducting the earlier studies. The birth outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis are examined in a nationwide  Danish  cohort of women based on data from the Danish National Hospital Discharge Registry and the Danish Medical Birth Registry  and within a Hungarian case-control data set. Our data suggest: 1) Significantly increased risk of preterm birth when women give birth 0-6 months after establishment of the diagnosis. It is considered whether the increased risk may be influenced by disease activity around the time of establishing the diagnosis. 2) No increased risk of giving birth to children with low birth weight  intrauterine growth retardation or congenital abnormalities (evaluated overall). 3) Significantly increased risk of some selected congenital abnormalities (limb deficiencies  obstructive urinary and multiple congenital abnormalities). No other studies have examined the risk of selected congenital abnormalities in children born by women with ulcerative colitis. The pharmacoepidemiological studies on birth outcomes after use of anti-inflammatory drug therapy in pregnancy  including women with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease  are based on data from the Hungarian case-control data set  a countywide Danish prescription Database  the Danish National Hospital Discharge Registry  the Danish Medical Birth Registry  and review of selected medical records. After exposure to sulfasalazine during pregnancy our data suggest. No significantly increased overall relative risk of congenital abnormalities and no significantly increased risks of selected congenital abnormalities. After exposure to 5-aminosalicylic acid during pregnancy our data suggest. No significantly increased relative risk of low birth weight  intrauterine growth retardation or congenital abnormalities (evaluated overall). A significantly increased relative risk of preterm birth and stillbirth in ulcerative colitis women  compared to women with no prescription of reimbursed medicine in pregnancy - and also after comparing with women with chronic inflammatory bowel disease not taking 5-aminosalicylic acid during pregnancy. It is not clear whether these associations are causal or influenced by confounding by disease activity in particular. After maternal exposure to azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine during pregnancy our data suggest. An increased relative risk of preterm birth  congenital abnormalities  and perinatal mortality - also after using controls with similar underlying diseases. It is difficult to rule out an influence of uncontrolled confounding. These were the first published data from a controlled observational study on exposed women with chronic inflammatory bowel disease. After preconceptional paternal use of azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine our data suggest An increased risk of congenital abnormalities  although not significantly increased. The birth outcomes in women with Crohn's disease are examined in nationwide sub-cohorts classified according to type of anti-inflammatory drug exposure during pregnancy  and based on data from the Danish National Hospital Discharge Registry  the nationwide Danish Prescription Database and the Danish Medical Birth Registry. Furthermore  birth outcomes are examined in Crohn's disease women with disease activity during pregnancy  based on data from review of hospital records  the Danish National Hospital Discharge Registry and the Danish Medical Birth Registry. Our data suggest: 1) The risk of adverse birth outcomes in women with Crohn's disease varies according to the type of anti-inflammatory drug therapy in pregnancy. 2) Reassuring results according to low birth weight  intrauterine growth retardation  preterm birth and congenital abnormalities after use of sulfasalazine/5-aminosalicylic acid or steroids. 3) Worrisome findings of a significantly increased risk of preterm birth and an increased risk of congenital abnormalities (not significantly increased) after prescription of azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine during pregnancy. Some residual confounding by disease activity may have been left in the analyses of preterm birth. In Crohn's disease women with disease activity during pregnancy our data suggest: 1) A significantly increased relative risk of preterm birth in women with the highest degree of disease activity during pregnancy. 2) Disease activity does not seem to increase the risk of low birth weight  intrauterine growth retardation or congenital abnormalities. This study is the first epidemiological study of the risk of adverse birth outcomes in Crohn's disease women with disease activity during pregnancy  compared to women with no activity during pregnancy  and in which confounders have been taken into consideration. Exceeding the studies included in my previous PhD thesis  this thesis provides new evidence on the following subjects: i) the risk of selected congenital abnormalities in children of women with ulcerative colitis  ii) pharmacoepidemiological studies on the risk of adverse birth outcome after maternal azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine exposure in pregnancy  and the risk of congenital abnormalities in children fathered by men treated with azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine before conception  iii) the risk of adverse birth outcome in women with Crohn's disease according to type of anti-inflammatory drug treatment in pregnancy (sulfasalazine/5-aminosalicylic acid  steroids or azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine)  and iv) the impact of disease activity in women with Crohn's disease on adverse birth outcome. We learned from the studies in this thesis that the traditional way of reporting birth outcome in women with chronic inflammatory bowel disease  i.e. without having valid information on the type of underlying disease  concurrent therapeutic drug treatment and disease activity  is of limited value. The studies show that the risk of specific adverse birth outcome in women with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease depends on several factors including the time of birth in relation the début of disease  the type of underlying disease (ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease)  the type of anti-inflammatory drug treatment during pregnancy  and the degree of disease activity during pregnancy. At the same time one also has to realize that the existing evidence is still limited  especially in the field of reproductive safety after therapeutic drug treatment during pregnancy and possible effects of preconceptional therapeutic drug exposure.
Telemedicine,,,[Photographic screening for diabetic retinopathy in the county of North Jutland. The first fully digitalized telemedicine-screening clinic]. Screening for diabetic retinopathy was introduced in Denmark in 1988. At present  screening is carried out in four of the 14 counties  thus being available to a minority of diabetic subjects. According to the WHO but also the National Board of Health  all diabetic patients should undergo screening for diabetic retinopathy. Not only does screening pay off in terms of preservation of vision  it is also cost-effective  as confirmed in the present study. The first fully digitized clinic for retinopathic screening in diabetic patients was recently introduced in the County of North Jutland. Preliminary results from this clinic indicate that all procedures can be handled in this fully digitized system. We therefore predict that fully digitized clinics for retinopathic screening will be introduced throughout Denmark in the future.
Correction of Hearing Impairment,,,Prediction of IOI-HA scores using speech reception thresholds and speech discrimination scores in quiet. Outcome measures can be used to improve the quality of the rehabilitation by identifying and understanding which variables influence the outcome. This information can be used to improve outcomes for clients. In clinical practice  pure-tone audiometry  speech reception thresholds (SRTs)  and speech discrimination scores (SDSs) in quiet or in noise are common assessments made prior to hearing aid (HA) fittings. It is not known whether SRT and SDS in quiet relate to HA outcome measured with the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA). The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between pure-tone average (PTA)  SRT  and SDS in quiet and IOI-HA in both first-time and experienced HA users. SRT and SDS were measured in a sample of HA users who also responded to the IOI-HA. Fifty-eight Danish-speaking adult HA users. The psychometric properties were evaluated and compared to previous studies using the IOI-HA. The associations and differences between the outcome scores and a number of descriptive variables (age  gender  fitted monaurally/binaurally with HA  first-time/experienced HA users  years of HA use  time since last HA fitting  best ear PTA  best ear SRT  or best ear SDS) were examined. A multiple forward stepwise regression analysis was conducted using scores on the separate IOI-HA items  the global score  and scores on the introspection and interaction subscales as dependent variables to examine whether the descriptive variables could predict these outcome measures. Scores on single IOI-HA items  the global score  and scores on the introspection (items 1  2  4  and 7) and interaction (items 3  5  and 6) subscales closely resemble those previously reported. Multiple regression analysis showed that the best ear SDS predicts about 18-19% of the outcome on items 3 and 5 separately  and about 16% on the interaction subscale (sum of items 3  5  and 6) CONCLUSIONS: The best ears SDS explains some of the variance displayed in the IOI-HA global score and the interaction subscale. The relation between SDS and IOI-HA suggests that a poor unaided SDS might in itself be a limiting factor for the HA rehabilitation efficacy and hence the IOI-HA outcome. The clinician could use this information to align the user's HA expectations to what is within possible reach.
Correction of Hearing Impairment,,,Acceptable noise level (ANL) with Danish and non-semantic speech materials in adult hearing-aid users. The acceptable noise level (ANL) test is used for quantification of the amount of background noise subjects accept when listening to speech. This study investigates Danish hearing-aid users' ANL performance using Danish and non-semantic speech signals  the repeatability of ANL  and the association between ANL and outcome of the international outcome inventory for hearing aids (IOI-HA). ANL was measured in three conditions in both ears at two test sessions. Subjects completed the IOI-HA and the ANL questionnaire. Sixty-three Danish hearing-aid users; fifty-seven subjects were full time users and 6 were part time/non users of hearing aids according to the ANL questionnaire. ANLs were similar to results with American English speech material. The coefficient of repeatability (CR) was 6.5-8.8 dB. IOI-HA scores were not associated to ANL. Danish and non-semantic ANL versions yield results similar to the American English version. The magnitude of the CR indicates that ANL with Danish and non-semantic speech materials is not suitable for prediction of individual patterns of future hearing-aid use or evaluation of individual benefit from hearing-aid features. The ANL with Danish and non-semantic speech materials is not related to IOI-HA outcome.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate in the treatment of arthritis]. Glucosamine and chondroitin sulphate are naturally occurring substances used by an increasing number of Danish patients with arthritis  although neither of the compounds has been approved for sale in Denmark. Both substances can be taken by mouth and have no known significant side effects. Glucosamine and chondroitin sulphate have been examined in laboratory and animal experiments  and in several clinical studies  which have shown some effect on the symptoms of early or moderate arthritis. The long-term effect has not been evaluated sufficiently and studies of the relation between dose and effect are lacking for both compounds.
General Practice,,,Secondary hyperparathyroidism and mortality in hip fracture patients compared to a control group from general practice. Previously  little attention has been paid as to how disturbances in the parathyroid hormone (PTH)-calcium-vitamin D-axis  such as secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT)  relate to mortality amongst hip fracture patients. This study aimed to (1) determine if SHPT is associated with mortality in this group of patients  (2) investigate the association between serum (s-) PTH  s-total calcium  s-25-hydroxyvitamin D (s-25(OH)D) and mortality and (3) determine the prevalence of SHPT amongst hip fracture patients and a control group. The study included 562 hip fracture patients (HF) (age ≥ 70 years) admitted to a Danish university hospital. The hip fracture patients were prospectively enrolled in a dedicated hip fracture database. Each hip fracture patient was exactly matched according to age and sex with two controls randomly chosen from a control population of 21 778 subjects who had s-PTH  s-total calcium and s-25(OH)D measured at the Copenhagen General Practitioners Laboratory after referral from their general practitioner. The control group (Con) thus consisted of 1124 subjects. General 1-year mortality: Con-female 8.4%  Con-male 15.3%  HF-female 24.6%  HF-male 33.3%  p<0.0001 (log rank). SHPT AND RELATED 1-YEAR MORTALITY: Con-no SHPT 8.9%  Con-SHPT 16.8%  HF-no SHPT 22.7%  HF-SHPT 34.9%  p<0.0001 (log rank). The mortality rates were higher for controls with SHPT (OR 2.06  95% CI: 1.32-3.23)  hip fracture patients without SHPT (OR 3.00  95% CI: 2.14-4.20) and hip fracture patients with SHPT (OR 5.46  95% CI: 3.32-8.97) compared to the controls without SHPT. PREVALENCE OF SHPT: Con 16%  HF 20%  p=0.09 (Chi-square). Our study clearly shows that SHPT is significantly associated with mortality in both hip fracture patients and the control group. In the multivariate Cox regression analysis  s-PTH and s-total calcium were both significantly associated with mortality  whereas s-25(OH)D was not associated with mortality in this analysis. Our study furthermore indicates that SHPT is almost equally prevalent amongst the hip fracture patients and the control group.
Pediatrics,,,Native T1 values identify myocardial changes and stratify disease severity in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked  inherited disorder causing dilated cardiomyopathy with variable onset and progression. Currently we lack objective markers of the effect of therapies targeted towards preventing progression of subclinical cardiac disease. Thus  our aim was to compare the ability of native T1 and extracellular volume (ECV) measurements to differentiate risk of myocardial disease in DMD and controls. Twenty boys with DMD and 16 age/gender-matched controls without history predisposing to cardiac fibrosis  but with a clinical indication for cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) evaluation  underwent CMR with contrast. Data points collected include left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)  left ventricular mass  and presence of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). Native T1  and ECV regional mapping were obtained using both a modified Look-Locker (MOLLI) and saturation recovery single shot sequence (SASHA) on a 1.5T scanner. Using ordinal logistic regression models  controlling for age and LVEF  LGE-free septal we evaluated the ability native T1 and ECV assessments to differentiate levels of cardiomyopathy. Twenty DMD subjects aged 14.4 ± 4 years had an LVEF of 56.3 ± 7.4 %; 12/20 had LGE  all confined to the lateral wall. Sixteen controls aged 16.1 ± 2.2 years had an LVEF 60.4 ± 5.1 % and no LGE. Native T1 and ECV values were significantly higher in the DMD group (p < 0.05) with both MOLLI and SASHA imaging techniques. Native T1 demonstrated a 50 % increase in the ability to predict disease state (control  DMD without fibrosis  DMD with fibrosis). ECV demonstrated only the ability to predict presence of LGE  but could not distinguish between controls and DMD without fibrosis. LGE-spared regions of boys with DMD have significantly different native T1 and ECV values compared to controls. Native T1 measurements can identify early changes in DMD patients without the presence of LGE and help predict disease severity more effectively than ECV. Native T1 may be a novel outcome measure for early cardiac therapies in DMD and other cardiomyopathies.
General Practice,,,Follow-up home visits with registered dietitians have a positive effect on the functional and nutritional status of geriatric medical patients after discharge: a randomized controlled trial. To assess the additional benefits of individualized nutritional counselling by a registered dietitian in geriatric patients' home after discharge from hospital  in relation to risk of re-admissions  functional status  nutritional status  use of social services and mortality. Twelve-week single-blind randomized controlled study. Geriatric medical patients (65+ years) at nutritional risk. Participants were randomly allocated to receive a visit in their homes  either three individualized nutritional counselling by a registered dietitian complemented with three follow-up visits by general practitioners or three follow-up visits by general practitioners alone. Primary outcome was risk of re-admissions. Secondary outcomes were functional status (hand grip strength  chair stand  mobility  disability and tiredness in daily activities  rehabilitation capacity)  nutritional status (weight  BMI  energy and protein intake)  need of social services (home care  home nursing  meals-on-wheels) and mortality. One hundred and fifty-two patients were included; 132 (87%) completed the first and 124 (82%) the second data collection after 12 weeks. Ten per cent of the participants had three contacts with their general practitioner  while compliance with the dietetic intervention was almost 100%. Odds ratio for re-admission and mortality after 26 weeks was 1.62 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 3.10) and 0.60 (95% CI 0.17 to 2.13). The intervention had a positive effect on functional status (i.e. mobility  P = 0.029)  and nutritional status (i.e. weight  P = 0.035; energy intake  P < 0.001; protein intake  P = 0.001) and the use of meals-on wheels was reduced (P = 0.084). Follow-up home visits with registered dietitians have a positive effect on the functional and nutritional status of geriatric medical patients after discharge.
General Practice,,,Study protocol: follow-up home visits with nutrition: a randomised controlled trial. Geriatric patients are at high risk of re-admission after discharge. Pre-existing nutritional risk amongst these patients is of primary concern  with former nutritional intervention studies being largely ineffective. None of these studies has included individual dietary counselling by a registered dietician or has considered competing medical conditions in the participants. A former randomised study has shown that comprehensive discharge follow-up in geriatric patients homes by general practitioners and district nurses was effective in reducing the re-admission risk in the intervention group compared to the control group. That study did not include a nutritional intervention. The purpose of this study is to assess the combined benefits of an intervention consisting of discharge follow-up in geriatric patients' home by a general practitioner and a registered dietician. This single-blind randomised controlled study  will recruit 160 hospitalised geriatric medical patients (65+ y) at nutritional risk. Participants will be randomly allocated to receive in their homes  either 12 weeks individualised nutritional counselling by a registered dietician complemented with follow-up by general practitioners or a 12 weeks follow-up by general practitioners alone. This trial is the first of its kind to provide individual nutritional intervention combined with follow-up by general practitioner as an intervention to reduce risk of re-admission after discharge among geriatric medical patients. The results will hopefully help to guide the development of more effective rehabilitation programs following hospital admissions  which may ultimately lead to reduced health care costs  and improvement in mobility  independence and quality of life for geriatric patients at nutritional risk.

Evidence-Based Medicine,,,How successful are first episode programs? A review of the evidence for specialized assertive early intervention. It has been hypothesized that the first 5 years after first episode of psychosis are a critical period with opportunities for ameliorating the course of illness. On the basis of this rationale  specialized assertive early intervention services were developed. We wanted to investigate the evidence basis for such interventions. The evidence for the effectiveness of specialized assertive early intervention services is mainly based on one large randomized clinical trial  the OPUS trial  but it is supported by the findings in smaller trials  such as the Lambeth Early Onset trial  the Croydon Outreach and Assertive Support Team trial and the Norwegian site of Optimal Treatment trial. There are positive effects on psychotic and negative symptoms  on substance abuse and user satisfaction  but the clinical effects are not sustainable when patients are transferred to standard treatment. However  the positive effects on service use and ability to live independently seem to be durable. Implementation of specialized assertive early intervention services is recommended  but the evidence basis needs to be strengthened through replication in large high-quality trials. Recommendation regarding the duration of treatment must await results of ongoing trials comparing 2 years of intervention with extended treatment periods.
Family Practice,,,[Supervision--why?]. In their work  doctors are exposed to strong emotions on the part of their patients. They need to learn to listen and not interrupt them; in general  after each consultation they focus on whatever was not accomplished. Therefore doctors need a secure environment in which they can examine common work conditions  as well as their own strengths and weaknesses  with colleagures in order to discover new ways of doing things. Based on this observation  it is a very positive development that supervision has become a part of the new specialist training for general practice.
Evidence-Based Medicine,Urology,,International Children's Continence Society's recommendations for initial diagnostic evaluation and follow-up in congenital neuropathic bladder and bowel dysfunction in children. The objective of this ICCS standardization document is to report the initial diagnostic evaluation and subsequent work-up of children with neuropathic bladder dysfunction. Due to a paucity of level I or level II  "levels of evidence" publications  these recommendations are actually a compilation of best practices because they seem to be effective and reliable  although not with any control. Throughout the document  the emphasis is on promoting early  comprehensive evaluation of lower urinary tract function that is thorough but with a minimum of unnecessary testing. This includes what tests to order  when to order them and what to do with the results. Some of the recommendations may not be practical in various worldwide locations but the suggested testing should be considered the ideal approach to completely diagnosing and then promulgating treatments based on the full knowledge of the condition and its effect on urinary tract function. Once the findings are delineated  those lower urinary tract patterns of dysfunction that put the kidneys at risk for deterioration  that are barriers to attaining eventual continence  and that have long-term consequence to the lower urinary track can be obviated by specific management recommendations. The indications and timing of investigations to achieve these objectives are clearly defined in each diagnostic category and during follow-up. This document should be used as a basis for appropriate evaluation and timely surveillance of the various neuro-urologic conditions that affect children.
Pediatrics,,,Differences in MBL levels between juvenile patients newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and their healthy siblings. The incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) has during the last few decades been increasing in children and juveniles. Multi-factorial courses combining genetic disposition and environmental factors might be in play  and through the years  there has been a mounting interest in the innate immune system's role in the development of T1D. The aim of this study was to determine mannose binding lectin (MBL) levels in newly diagnosed children with T1D (n=481) over a period of 10 years (1997-2005) and to compare these levels with corresponding levels in their healthy siblings (n=479). Furthermore  the aims were to evaluate if MBL-levels in patients and siblings were influenced by season  age autoimmunity and/or changed over time. The study found that MBL levels differed between patients and their healthy siblings when adjusted for age  gender  season and period. More patients than siblings had MBL levels above 0.8 μg/ml  associated with high producing MBL genotypes  and the elevated MBL levels were associated with high levels of four T1D related cytokines (IL-1β  IL-12  IL-18 and TNF-α). MBL levels increased during the study period and siblings had seasonal variance in concentrations with the lowest level during wintertime (Dec-Feb). In conclusion  more patients than siblings had a high MBL level  and high levels of MBL were related to high levels of T1D specific cytokines  supporting a role of the innate immune system and MBL on the risk of developing T1D.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Insulin pump therapy in children and teenagers]. The number of insulin pump users registered in the Danish paediatric diabetes clinics shows an increase of approximately 500% from 2002 to 2006. The current evidence for improved insulin treatment by insulin pump therapy is mainly based on retrospective follow-up studies. Well-organised  longer and prospectively designed RCTs - especially focussing on possible differences in the resources used by health care professionals - are warranted to provide sufficient evidence for any improved benefits of insulin pump therapy in children and adolescents with diabetes.
Gastroenterology,,,The downstream financial effect of hepatology. As a more consultative but less procedurally oriented specialty  Hepatology has been considered a financial liability in some academic centers. However  no actual data exist on the relative contribution of a Hepatology practice. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the direct and indirect (i.e.  downstream effect) charges generated by a Hepatology section in comparison with a Gastroenterology section. Using a computerized database  retrospective cohorts of new outpatient consultations and initial admissions seen by the Hepatology and Gastroenterology sections over a 3-month period were created. The cohorts were followed for 12 months. Charges generated directly to the section (direct charges) and to the hospital system (indirect charges) were calculated. Each cohort consisted of 179 patients. The Hepatology patients generated 5 851 463 dollars in overall charges for the hospital  compared with 2 273 339 dollars for the Gastroenterology cohort. Only 3.6% of the Hepatology charges were direct  compared with 15.9% of the Gastroenterology charges. For every 1 dollar billed by Hepatology  the hospital system generated an additional 26.95 dollars in charges (51.03 dollars for the orthotopic liver transplantation patients  and 14.26 dollars for the non-orthotopic liver transplantation patients). For every 1 dollar billed by Gastroenterology  the hospital system generated an additional 5.31 dollars in charges. Similar inpatient collection rates were seen between the two groups (27.7% for hepatology and 33.6% for gastroenterology). In conclusion  although Hepatology generates only a small amount of direct charges  it accounts for a very substantial amount of indirect or downstream billing for an academic medical center. This study validates the importance of a hospital's support for a Hepatology section  especially in a center performing orthotopic liver transplantation.
Radiation Oncology,,,The need for radiotherapy in Europe in 2020: Not only data but also a cancer plan. Planning radiation oncology equipment and staffing is necessary in public healthcare systems in Europe. Three different data inputs were considered: evidence-based indications for radiotherapy  the incidence of cancer  and the stage at diagnosis of each cancer type  both the latter using population-based data from cancer registries. The availability of these data and the implications for the estimation of the proportion of new cancer patients who would need radiotherapy treatment at least once during the course of the disease is reviewed. Depending on the frequency of cancers and the stage at diagnosis  it has been estimated that between 47% and 53% of incident cases among European countries would require external beam radiotherapy. When the actual data of utilization is compared with the evidence-based target  only one country in Europe has achieved full coverage. It is argued that these should be considered the optimal proportions of cancer patients  but a more realistic policy target could be set at 80% or higher of the optimal proportion. This realistic target also takes into account the inherent uncertainties in the assessment of evidence  and other factors that influence clinical decision-making in cases of multi-morbidity or patient preferences. Other factors are associated with problems that should be dealt with in the framework of a cancer plan  such as accessibility  preference bias in physician evaluation of the indication or shortage of resources  and the impact of the reimbursement system. Finally  it is argued that a cancer plan is the framework for achieving policy targets in the appropriate coverage of the evidence-based indications for radiation oncology forecasts.
Radiation Oncology,,,Cost calculation: a necessary step towards widespread adoption of advanced radiotherapy technology. Radiotherapy costs are an often underestimated component of the economic assessment of new radiotherapy treatments and technologies. That the radiotherapy budget only consumes a finite part of the total cancer and healthcare budget does not relieve us from our responsibility to balance the extra costs to the additional benefits of new  more advanced  but typically also more expensive treatments we want to deliver. Yet  in contrast to what is the case for oncology drugs  literature evidence remains limited  as well for economic evaluations comparing new radiotherapy interventions as for cost calculation studies. Even more cumbersome  the available costing studies in the field of radiotherapy fail to accurately capture the real costs of our treatments due to the large variation in cost inputs  in scope of the analysis  in costing methodology. And this is not trivial. Accurate resource cost accounting lays the basis for the further steps in health technology assessment leading to radiotherapy investments and reimbursement  at the local  the national and the worldwide level. In the current paper we review some evidence from the existing costing literature and discuss how such data can be used to support reimbursement setting and investment cases for new radiotherapy equipment and infrastructure.
Forensic Toxicology,,,Post-mortem vitreous humour as potential specimen for detection of insulin analogues by LC-MS/MS. Differentiation of insulin analogues is required in forensic and clinical toxicology as well as in sports doping control. Immunoassay results provide only weak evidence for exogenous administration of insulin  as concentrations cannot be reliably interpreted and specific information on the insulin species remains unknown. In post-mortem blood  insulin degrades rapidly. In this study  improved methodology consisting of precipitation of proteins  immunoaffinity purification and liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution/high accuracy mass spectrometry were applied to post-mortem vitreous humour. Ten successive cases with a post-mortem interval from four to ten days were investigated for insulin analogues. The cause of death in these cases was connected with diabetes and its complications  as well as with chronic cardiovascular disease  alcoholism and cancer. In all cases  the manner of death was natural (disease). Insulin was positively detected in post-mortem vitreous humour in three cases out of ten by mass spectrometry. In two cases  the method revealed the long-acting insulin glargine (Lantus) metabolite M2 (DesB31-32 Lantus)  and human insulin was detected in one case. The findings were in agreement with the documented history of insulin medication. No other obvious reason could be found for the failure of detecting insulins in the other cases than insulin degradation during the lengthy post-mortem interval. Vitreous humour is still a most prospective specimen for detection of insulin analogues post-mortem.
Integrative Medicine,,,Exploring integrative medicine for back and neck pain - a pragmatic randomised clinical pilot trial. A model for integrative medicine (IM) adapted to Swedish primary care was previously developed. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of a pragmatic randomised clinical trial to investigate the effectiveness of the IM model versus conventional primary care in the management of patients with non-specific back/neck pain. Specific objectives included the exploration of recruitment and retention rates  patient and care characteristics  clinical differences and effect sizes between groups  selected outcome measures and power calculations to inform the basis of a full-scale trial. Eighty patients with back/neck pain of at least two weeks duration were randomised to the two types of care. Outcome measures were standardised health related quality of life (the eight domains of SF-36) complemented by a set of exploratory "IM tailored" outcomes targeting self-rated disability  stress and well-being (0-10 scales); days in pain (0-14); and the use of analgesics and health care over the last two weeks (yes/no). Data on clinical management were derived from medical records. Outcome changes from baseline to follow-up after 16 weeks were used to explore the differences between the groups. Seventy-five percent (80/107) of screened patients in general practice were eligible and feasible to enroll into the trial. Eighty-two percent (36/44) of the integrative and 75% (27/36) of the conventional care group completed follow-up after 16 weeks. Most patients had back/neck pain of at least three months duration. Conventional care typically comprised advice and prescription of analgesics  occasionally complemented with sick leave or a written referral to physiotherapy. IM care generally integrated seven treatment sessions from two different types of complementary therapies with conventional care over ten weeks. The study was underpowered to detect any statistically significant differences between the groups. One SF-36 domain showed a clinically relevant difference between groups that was also supported by a small distribution based effect size  i.e. vitality (-7.3 points  Cohen's d -0.34) which was in favour of IM. There was a clinical trend between groups showing that IM contributed to less use of prescription and non-prescription analgesics (-11.7 and - 9.7 percent units respectively) compared to conventional care. Exploring clinically relevant differences and the SF-36 as the basis for a main outcome measure showed that the sample sizes needed per arm to adequately power a full-scale trial depended on the target domain  i.e. ranging from 60 (vitality) to 339 (role emotion). This pilot study investigated the implementation of IM in the primary care management of non-specific back and neck pain. Recruiting patients and implementing IM in routine clinical practice was feasible. The results warrant further exploration into different perspectives and relevant combinations of outcome measures including the use of health resources  drugs and cost-effectiveness to help understand the relevance of IM in primary care. Future research should prioritize larger scale studies considering variability  pain duration and small to moderate treatment effects. Clinical trials NCT00565942.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Potentially preventable deaths in a medium sized community hospital]. The purpose of this study was to estimate the occurrence and causes of potentially preventable deaths at a medium sized community hospital. A review of a consecutive series of records of 48 deceased patients (age 58-98 years  median 81 years  40% males) was conducted by four observers  followed by a consensus conference in which the deaths were classified as potentially preventable according to a checklist  focusing on the occurrence of adverse events or failure to comply with evidence-based procedures. 10 of the 48 deaths were considered potentially preventable; in two cases the potential was considered significant  but the age and underlying diseases of the patients suggest that the potential number of saved life years is modest. The main reasons for preventability were unintended delays  ineffective treatment plans  and lack of reactions to new and important diagnostic information. The review of the deaths revealed a considerable number of potentially preventable cases. Furthermore  a number of suggestions for improvement were identified: (1) early identification and aggressive treatment of impending sepsis; (2) employment of routines to ensure that new diagnostic information is reviewed and acted upon and (3) systematic updating of competences in all staff members.
Forensic Pathology,,,Non-fatal injuries to the cervical spine facet joints after a fatal motor vehicle crash: a case report. Injuries to the lower cervical spine facet joints may be identified in people killed in road traffic crashes. However  many of these injuries are not identified on diagnostic imaging procedures despite histological evidence of injury. This case report illustrates possible non-lethal pathological conditions in the facet joints following fatal road traffic trauma. The cervical spine segments C4 to C7 were removed en bloc and examined with magnetic resonance imaging  computed tomography and conventional radiology. The specimen was fixated in alcohol  embedded in methylmethacrylate  and divided into 3 mm thick parasaggital slices from where 10 microm thick sections were produced and evaluated with light microscopy. Injuries identified on microscopy included haemarthrosis  capsular avulsion  synovial fold contusions and subchondral fractures. None of the injuries were detected on diagnostic imaging or at routine autopsy. Discrete injuries to the cervical spine facet joints were identified using supplemental histological procedures in this case report. Post-mortem diagnostic imaging did not reveal these injuries and future studies should investigate the nature  prevalence and clinical relevance of such lesions.
Forensic Pathology,,,Imaging occult lesions in the cervical spine facet joints. Discrete injuries in the lower cervical spine facet joints have been reported in studies of motor vehicle crash victims. We conducted a detailed investigation of these joints from 20 motor vehicle crash fatalities and 22 decedents due to nontraumatic causes  using conventional radiology  computed tomography  and magnetic resonance imaging to examine whether the diagnostic imaging procedures could identify injuries in the facet joints. The diagnostic imaging procedures identified facet joint fractures in 4 of the 19 trauma cases with computed tomography having the highest sensitivity and obtaining good correlation with findings from the microscopical evaluation. No diagnostic imaging procedure could reliably evaluate the integrity of the synovial folds or the joint spaces for bleeding despite microscopical evidence of such findings in these structures in a large proportion of the motor vehicle crash fatalities. This study emphasizes the need for scientific evidence of validity and reliability of advanced diagnostic imaging procedures in forensic settings  in particular  with regard to occult soft tissue lesions  and cautions uncritical use of negative results from these procedures until such evidence has been produced.
Precision Medicine,,,[Monitoring of bioavailability  pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of tumour necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors]. Treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with antibodies against tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) is effective. Not all patients respond  however  and the effect wears off in a considerable fraction of initial responders over time. Individual differences in bioavailability  pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity are now recognized as essential problems in the use of biologicals  and blood measurements of functional anti-TNF antibodies and antibodies against anti-TNF drugs with robust and clinically relevant methods may optimize treatment of IBD through individualized therapeutic regimens.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Medical treatment of small abdominal aortic aneurysms]. Our expectation is that the numbers of diagnosed small abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) will increase in the future. Slowing down the progression of AAAs is of great interest as this could prevent cost-intensive and potential lethal operations. Recent studies indicate that modern medical treatment such as prevention for cardiovascular disease has a spin-off benefit by suppressing the expansion rate of AAAs. According to these studies ACE inhibitors  statins and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may have effect  macrolides may have some effect while beta-blockers and calcium-channel blockers have no effect.
Epidemiology,Radiology,,Fracture incidence rates in Norwegian children  The Tromsø Study  Fit Futures. This study describes childhood fracture rates in Norway  a country known for high fracture rates in the adult population. Fracture rates correspond with other reports from Scandinavia  although with a slightly higher proportion in girls. Indications of increased vulnerability during stages of puberty require further exploration. Fractures are common injuries during childhood. Incidence rates and patterns vary  but population-based data are scarce. The aim of this study was to describe the sex-  age- and maturation-specific incidence of fractures in a representative population-based sample from a region in Norway. All fractures in the population based convenient cohort Fit Futures  comprising 961 adolescents under 18 years  were recorded retrospectively from the local hospital. Details on individual's age and fracture site were recorded. A radiologist confirmed all fractures. In the period from birth to cohort scanning  the register recorded 316 fractures in 253 individuals. Fractures were more common in boys (35%) than in girls (31%). The overall annual fracture incidence was 204 per 10 000 persons-year under the age of 18 and 205 under the age of 16. The majority of fractures involved the upper extremities and the most common site of fracture was the forearm with 24% of the fractures followed by phalanges with 23% of the fractures. Fractures peaked in girls at sexual maturation stage 3. Boys had a peak in stage 2. Timing of subsequent fractures was also consistent with stages of sexual maturation. The overall incidence of fractures in childhood in Northern Norway corresponds with other reports from Scandinavia  although the proportion of fractures in girls is higher than in other studies. Both sexes seem especially vulnerable at stages related to sexual maturation. Whether this reflects bone vulnerability or other changes related to puberty requires further investigation.
School Dentistry,,,The impact of behavioural interventions on young people's attitudes toward tobacco use. The objective of the present study was to study the ability to influence young at-risk patients' attitudes toward tobacco use through two intervention methods that were performed by dental health professionals. Two interventions  a brief individual motivational interview and an adapted school lecture  were studied  and both were compared with a control group. Before and after interventions  a questionnaire was used. Patients born in 1989 and 1992 who were judged by the dental personnel as potentially at risk for dental diseases  a total of 301 individuals  were included. Both before and after interventions  the results showed a generally negative attitude towards tobacco use. A majority of the participants were positive towards measures that were taken to control the spread of tobacco use  younger participants (born 1992) to a greater extent (73%) than the older participants (born 1989) (54%). Important factors that kept the participants away from tobacco use were the harmful effects and the approaches of parents and friends. The older participants believed to a greater extent that they would try smoking as adults. No change in tobacco use was registered after intervention  although the participants reported an increased use among friends. The two pedagogical methods that were used in the present study influenced the young people's attitudes towards tobacco use only to a small extent. However  the period between 12 and 15 years old seems to provide a good opportunity to influence attitudes towards tobacco. The adolescents' demand for interactive learning and their development of attitudes and tobacco use habits in relation to family and friends provide opportunities to use new pedagogical models.
Global Health,,,Evolution of diagnostic criteria for gestational diabetes mellitus. The establishment of universal diagnostic guidelines for gestational diabetes mellitus has been a long time coming. The lack of consensus and uniformity in procedures for diagnosing this disease has been a problem ever since its existence was recognized. The USA  European countries  and Australia have each developed their own guidelines through the years  all based either on the maternal risk of subsequent diabetes  on arbitrary statistics  or on studies conducted on non-pregnant women. None of these guidelines have been based on risk for perinatal complications. Recently  the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes study demonstrated that maternal hyperglycemia is associated with perinatal risk in a linear way with no obvious threshold. The International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group has translated these results into clinical practice by proposing new diagnostic criteria for gestational diabetes mellitus  based for the first time on perinatal outcome.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Obese pregnant women and complications in relation to pregnancy and birth]. One third of the pregnant Danish women are overweight or obese. Maternal obesity is an independent risk factor for adverse maternal and foetal outcomes including infertility  miscarriage  congenital malformations  preeclampsia  gestational diabetes  complicated deliveries  caesarean section  macrosomia and childhood obesity. This article reviews the effect of maternal obesity on obstetric and neonatal outcomes and provides recommendations for management of obesity in pregnancy.
Forensic Medicine,,,Demographic and socioeconomic risk factors of adult violent victimization from an accident and emergency department and forensic medicine perspective: a register-based case-control study. To describe demographic and socioeconomic risk factors of adult violent victimization leading to contact with an emergency department and/or an institute of forensic medicine based on a case-control study design. A register-based case-control study comparing demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of 10 799 adult victims of violence (cases) and 53 986 randomly selected population-based controls matched for age  gender  and date. Cases were included from a Danish emergency department and a Danish institute of forensic medicine. Demographic and socioeconomic data for cases and controls were extracted from two national longitudinal registers. Data were analysed using logistic regression in a semi-adjusted model adjusting for age  gender  and year  and a fully adjusted model including several variables. Factors positively associated with adult violent victimization were "being a pensioner" (OR: 4.71; 95% CI: 4.18-5.30)  "being unemployed" (OR: 3.15; 95% CI: 2.85-3.48)  and "not living with a partner" (OR: 2.93; 95% CI: 2.74-3.14)  whereas the factors strongly negatively associated with adult violent victimization was "being a student" (OR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.63-0.83). In the semi-adjusted analysis a foreign citizenship of a country outside Europe was significantly associated with adult violent victimization (OR: 1.79; 95% CI: 1.60-2.00)  whereas in the fully adjusted analyses the association decreased to an insignificant level. Our findings emphasize the multifaceted nature of injuries from violence. The findings from this study indicated potential risk factors  which should be specifically addressed when planning preventive strategies.
Forensic Medicine,,,The epidemiology of repeat contacts with an Emergency Department or an Institute of Forensic Medicine due to violent victimization in a Danish urban population. The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of repeat contacts with an urban emergency department (ED) and/or an institute of forensic medicine. All victims of violence in contact with the ED at Odense University Hospital and/or the Institute of Forensic Medicine  University of Southern Denmark 1991-2002 were included. Victims who had two or more contacts were identified as repeat victims and a recurrence proportion was estimated. Survival analysis was made with time of observation from the first to the second contact due to violence and a repetition percentage was estimated as the proportion with repeated characteristics in the incident leading to the second contact compared to the index contact and a repetition percentage was estimated. Overall 10 216 individuals with 14 307 incidents were included in the study. Overall  the recurrence proportion was 22% and repeat victims who were responsible for 44% of all contacts to the ED and/or the Institute of Forensic Medicine in the study period. The median time from first to the next incident was 1.75 years for males and 1.64 years for females. Overall 34% of the males and 37% of the females experienced the next incident within 1 year. The time span decreased significantly with increasing age for both males and females. The frequency of weapon use was low with a repetition percentage of 17% for males and 7% for females. For potential severe lesions such as bone fractures and internal lesions the repetition percentage was 28% and 19% for males and 23% and 25% for females. The present study showed that contact with an ED due to violent victimization often is followed by subsequent contacts with the same ED and/or the IFM due re-victimization and that recurrent incidents share characteristics.
Forensic Medicine,,,What is the lifetime risk of contact with an A&E Department or an Institute of Forensic Medicine following violent victimisation? The aim of the study was to estimate the age and gender specific incidence rates of first time contact with an A&E Department and/or an Institute of Forensic Medicine due to violent victimisation in a Danish low-risk urban population and  secondly to estimate the corresponding lifetime risk of violence based upon these incidence rates. All first time contacts of victims of violence with the A&E Department at Odense University Hospital and/or the Institute of Forensic Medicine  University of Southern Denmark 1991-2002 were included. Based on estimated age and gender specific annual incidence rates of first time violence and on the survival rates of the background population  the lifetime risk was estimated assuming calendar time stationarity of incidence and survival rates. The overall annual incidence rate of first time violence was 9.2 [95% CI: 9.0-9.4] per 1000 population/year for males and 2.6 [95% CI: 2.5-2.7] per 1000 population/year for females. The estimated lifetime risk was 0.440 [95% CI: 0.438-0.442] for males and 0.180 [95% CI: 0.178-0.181] for females. The highest cumulative risk for both males and females was in the age group 15-24 years  0.192 [95% CI: 0.188-0.195] for males and 0.048 [95% CI: 0.046-0.051] for females. The current study shows  that even in a country with a relatively low risk of violent victimisation a considerable part of the population over a lifetime will need medical assistance after violent victimisation.
Forensic Medicine,,,Trends in deliberate interpersonal violence in the Odense Municipality  Denmark 1991-2002. The Odense study on deliberate interpersonal violence. A 12-year study was carried out to investigate the development of interpersonal violence based on A and E department and/or forensic data from a Danish urban population. Included in the study were all victims of violence from the Odense municipality treated at the Odense University Hospital or subjected to medicolegal autopsy at the Institute of Forensic Medicine  University of Southern Denmark 1991-2002. Overall 14 316 victims of violence were included in the study. The incidence rates of violence were 9.9 and 3.4 per 1000 population/year for males and females. For males the incidence rate decreased in the study period whereas the incidence rate was unchanged among females. Less serious lesions and wounds were the most common type of lesions. The percentage of less serious lesions increased in the study period. The percentage of potential severe lesions such as bone fractures and deep lesions decreased in the study period. The percentage of patients stabbed or cut with knives  the percentage of gunshots  and the mortality rate did not change in the study period. The present study showed no evidence of an increased frequency or severity of interpersonal violence which contrasts with the increased public concern about violence.
Evidence-Based Practice,,,Designing for health in school buildings: between research and practice. To investigate the kinds of knowledge practitioners use when planning and designing for health in school buildings. Twelve semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with architects  teachers and officials to investigate use of knowledge in the making of school buildings. Practitioners drew on many kinds and sources of knowledge  but in particular they made use of concepts  examples or pictures or thought-provoking knowledge. However  the interviews indicate a number of hurdles for efficient knowledge sharing between research and practice: (1) a considerable discrepancy between kinds of knowledge used by practice and knowledge traditionally produced by research; (2) research-knowledge and practice-knowledge form two circuits and the flow from one circuit to the other is weak; (3) practitioners' knowledge was often based on experience and therefore person-dependent. It makes the knowledge vulnerable. Special attention has to be paid by research to concepts and principles to guide the decision-making in practice. Further is recommended to consider new kinds of collaboration between researchers and practitioners.
Hospital Administration,,,Quality of hospital care evaluated by Danish nurses and doctors--based on experience from their own or a close family member's hospitalization. No studies have systematically asked larger groups of health professionals about their own experience as patients. This study estimated the level of satisfaction with hospital care among health professionals based on experience from their own hospital admission or that of a close family member. A cross-sectional questionnaire study of 1995 doctors (41% women) and 1472 nurses (98% women) drawn randomly from union registers. Response rate: 70%. Twenty-seven percent had themselves been hospitalized within the preceding five years  and 31% had followed a hospital stay for a close relative during the preceding two years. At least 85% were satisfied with these conditions: information from the hospital  nursing staff  and doctors before admission; quality of the sickroom; level of smoke exposure; quality of breakfast  lunch  and beverages; nursing staff's and doctors' communication with the patient  and; doctors' treatment and diagnostics. Dissatisfaction above 15% was seen for several other factors associated with facilities  care  and treatment. One severe observation was related to the degree of treatment complications  reported by 23% of the patients. When reporting on behalf of an admitted relative a tendency was found to be slightly more critical. Generally  the results of this study are in agreement with previous Danish studies on patient satisfaction. The results of the present study indicate room for improvement in several respects in Danish hospital care: Better physical facilities  improved patient information  and a continuous quality surveillance to prevent treatment errors.
Medicine,Specialization,,[Research activity in clinical biochemistry]. Quantitative bibliometric measurements of research activity are frequently used  e.g. for evaluating applicants for academic positions. The purpose of this investigation is to assess research activity within the medical speciality of Clinical Biochemistry by comparing it with a matched control group from other medical specialities in Denmark. A list of all physicians registered in Denmark (23 127 persons) was drawn from the database "Laeger.dk". Of these  5 202 were generalists (not included) while 11 691 were from other specialities. Of the 126 specialists from Clinical Biochemistry  57 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Each of these 57 was matched according to medical title with two randomly chosen specialists from other specialities  totaling 114. Using Medline and the Web of Science  the number of publications and the number of citations were then ascertained. 25% of the 11 691 specialists held a PhD degree or doctoral degree  DMSci  (Clinical Biochemistry: 61%). The 171 specialists included in the study had 9 823 papers in Medline and 10 140 papers in the Web of Science. The number of Medline papers per specialist was 71 for Clinical Biochemistry compared to 51 for the control group. The number of citations per specialist was 1 844 for Clinical Biochemistry compared to 816 for the control group. The top ten H-indices (of which 8 were in Clinical Biochemistry) ranged from 30 to 69. Both the number of papers and the number of citations were higher for Clinical Biochemistry than for the control group. The difference was most pronounced among professors.
Telerehabilitation,,,Cardiac Patients' Walking Activity Determined by a Step Counter in Cardiac Telerehabilitation: Data From the Intervention Arm of a Randomized Controlled Trial. Walking represents a large part of daily physical activity. It reduces both overall and cardiovascular diseases and mortality and is suitable for cardiac patients. A step counter measures walking activity and might be a motivational tool to increase and maintain physical activity. There is a lack of knowledge about both cardiac patients' adherence to step counter use in a cardiac telerehabilitation program and how many steps cardiac patients walk up to 1 year after a cardiac event. The purpose of this substudy was to explore cardiac patients' walking activity. The walking activity was analyzed in relation to duration of pedometer use to determine correlations between walking activity  demographics  and medical and rehabilitation data. A total of 64 patients from a randomized controlled telerehabilitation trial (Teledi@log) from Aalborg University Hospital and Hjoerring Hospital  Denmark  from December 2012 to March 2014 were included in this study. Inclusion criteria were patients hospitalized with acute coronary syndrome  heart failure  and coronary artery bypass grafting or valve surgery. In Teledi@log  the patients received telerehabilitation technology and selected one of three telerehabilitation settings: a call center  a community health care center  or a hospital. Monitoring of steps continued for 12 months and a step counter (Fitbit Zip) was used to monitor daily steps. Cardiac patients walked a mean 5899 (SD 3274) steps per day  increasing from mean 5191 (SD 3198) steps per day in the first week to mean 7890 (SD 2629) steps per day after 1 year. Adherence to step counter use lasted for a mean 160 (SD 100) days. The patients who walked significantly more were younger (P=.01) and continued to use the pedometer for a longer period (P=.04). Furthermore  less physically active patients weighed more. There were no significant differences in mean steps per day for patients in the three rehabilitation settings or in the disease groups. This study indicates that cardiac telerehabilitation at a call center can support walking activity just as effectively as telerehabilitation at either a hospital or a health care center. In this study  the patients tended to walk fewer steps per day than cardiac patients in comparable studies  but our study may represent a more realistic picture of walking activity due to the continuation of step counter use. Qualitative studies on patients' behavior and motivation regarding step counter use are needed to shed light on adherence to and motivation to use step counters.

Pharmacoepidemiology,,,Influence of baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol values on statin therapy persistence. Persistence to statins is low  in part due to lack of perception of cardiovascular (CV) risk. High values of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) might increase the motivation for patients to be persistent. We investigated whether the baseline LDL-C value influences the discontinuation of statin treatment in patients with and without previous CV events. A cohort study was performed using information from the Swedish national registers concerning dispensed drugs  hospital contacts  cause of death  and socioeconomic status  and linked with data from clinical laboratories. Incident statin users 20 years of age or older and starting treatment between 2006 and 2007 were identified and followed for 1 year. Baseline LDL-C level was defined as the last available laboratory test result during 6 months before the index statin dispensing. Cox regression was used to study discontinuation and estimate the effect on persistence of the baseline LDL-C value adjusting for sex  age  income  comorbidity  previous CV events  type of prescriber  and country of birth. Subgroup analyses stratifying by previous CV events and by diagnosis of diabetes among subjects without previous CV events were performed. A total of 29 389 patients were identified; 35.4% had a previous CV event. A high baseline LDL-C value was associated with a lower discontinuation rate (hazard ratio (HR) 0.81  95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72-0.91) in patients without previous CV events. When stratifying further by diabetes diagnosis  the association was confirmed only in patients without diabetes. No association between LDL-C and persistence was found in patients with previous CV events. High levels of LDL-C were positively associated with statin persistence in newly treated diabetes patients without previous CV events.
Pharmacoepidemiology,,,Data management and data analysis techniques in pharmacoepidemiological studies using a pre-planned multi-database approach: a systematic literature review. To identify pharmacoepidemiological multi-database studies and to describe data management and data analysis techniques used for combining data. Systematic literature searches were conducted in PubMed and Embase complemented by a manual literature search. We included pharmacoepidemiological multi-database studies published from 2007 onwards that combined data for a pre-planned common analysis or quantitative synthesis. Information was retrieved about study characteristics  methods used for individual-level analyses and meta-analyses  data management and motivations for performing the study. We found 3083 articles by the systematic searches and an additional 176 by the manual search. After full-text screening of 75 articles  22 were selected for final inclusion. The number of databases used per study ranged from 2 to 17 (median = 4.0). Most studies used a cohort design (82%) instead of a case-control design (18%). Logistic regression was most often used for individual-level analyses (41%)  followed by Cox regression (23%) and Poisson regression (14%). As meta-analysis method  a majority of the studies combined individual patient data (73%). Six studies performed an aggregate meta-analysis (27%)  while a semi-aggregate approach was applied in three studies (14%). Information on central programming or heterogeneity assessment was missing in approximately half of the publications. Most studies were motivated by improving power (86%). Pharmacoepidemiological multi-database studies are a well-powered strategy to address safety issues and have increased in popularity. To be able to correctly interpret the results of these studies  it is important to systematically report on database management and analysis techniques  including central programming and heterogeneity testing.
Orthopedics,,,Testing basic competency in knee arthroscopy using a virtual reality simulator: exploring validity and reliability. Diagnostic knee arthroscopy is a common procedure that orthopaedic residents are expected to learn early in their training. Arthroscopy requires a different skill set from traditional open surgery  and many orthopaedic residents feel less prepared for arthroscopic procedures. Virtual reality simulation training and testing provide an opportunity to ensure basic competency before proceeding to supervised procedures in patients. Twenty-six physicians (thirteen novices and thirteen experienced arthroscopic surgeons) were voluntarily recruited to perform a test consisting of five arthroscopic procedures on a knee arthroscopy simulator. Performance was evaluated by obtaining predefined metrics from the simulator for each procedure  and z-scores  describing suboptimal performance  were calculated from the metrics. The intercase reliability of the simulator metrics was explored by calculating an intraclass correlation coefficient. Finally  a pass-or-fail standard was set with use of the contrasting groups method  and the consequences of the pass-or-fail standard were explored. One procedure was excluded from the final test because of a lack of validity. The total Z-scores for the four procedures included in the final test showed an intercase reliability of 0.87 (95% confidence interval  0.78 to 0.93). The total mean z-score (and standard deviation) was 38.6 ± 27.3 points for the novices and 0.0 ± 9.1 points for the experienced surgeons (p < 0.0005). The pass-or-fail standard was set at a total z-score of 15.5 points  resulting in two of the novices passing the test and a single experienced surgeon failing the test. By combining four procedures on a virtual reality arthroscopy simulator  it was possible to create a valid  reliable  and feasible test of basic arthroscopic competency and to establish a credible pass-or-fail standard. The simulation-based test and pass-or-fail standard could aid in assessing and ensuring basic competency of future orthopaedic residents before proceeding to supervised procedures in patients.
Public Health,,,Racial And Ethnic Differences In The Frequency Of Workplace Injuries And Prevalence Of Work-Related Disability. Occupational injuries and illnesses lead to significant health care costs and productivity losses for millions of workers each year. This study used national survey data to test for differences between members of minority groups and non-Hispanic white workers in the risk of workplace injuries and the prevalence of work-related disabilities. Non-Hispanic black workers and foreign-born Hispanic workers worked in jobs with the highest injury risk  on average  even after adjustment for education and sex. These elevated levels of workplace injury risk led to a significant increase in the prevalence of work-related disabilities for non-Hispanic black and foreign-born Hispanic workers. These findings suggest that disparities in economic opportunities expose members of minority groups to increased risk of workplace injury and disability.
Allergy and Immunology,,,[Letters from the Nobellaureter Paul Ehrlich to the Director for the State Serum Institute in Copenhagen  Thorvald Madsen]. In 2003 some letters  written from 1905-1915 by the father to the chemotherapy  the Nobellaurter Paul Ehrlich (1854-1915) and his family written to Dr. Thorvald Madsen (1870-1957)  Director of the State Serum Institute from 1909 to 1940 was found. In these letters the personal and scientific relations between the two scientists is described on the background of the letters found. The article is written with the intention to celebrate the 150-birthday of Paul Ehrlich and to document the close relations between Paul Ehrlich and the founders of the State Serum Institute in Copenhagen: Carl Julius Salomonsen (1847-1924) and Thorvald Madsen.
Medical Oncology,Neurology,Pathology  Clinical,Patterns of diagnostic marker assessment in adult diffuse glioma: a survey of the European Confederation of Neuropathological Societies (Euro-CNS). The 2016 update of the WHO classification has introduced an integrated diagnostic approach that incorporates both tumor morphology and molecular information. This conceptual change has far-reaching implications  especially for neuropathologists who are in the forefront of translating molecular markers to routine diagnostic use. Adult diffuse glioma is a prototypic example for a group of tumors that underwent substantial regrouping  and it represents a major workload for surgical neuropathologists. Hence  we conducted a survey among members of the European Confederation of Neuropathological Societies (Euro-CNS) in order to assess 1) the extent to which molecular markers have already been incorporated in glioma diagnoses  2) which molecular techniques are in daily use  and 3) to set a baseline for future surveys in this field. Based on 130 responses from participants across 40 nations neuropathologists uniformly rate molecular marker testing as highly relevant and already incorporate molecular information in their diagnostic assessments. At the same time however  the survey documents substantial differences in access to crucial biomarkers and molecular techniques across geographic regions and within individual countries. Concerns are raised concerning the validity of test assays with MGMT  1p19q  and ATRX; being perceived as most problematic. Neuropathologists advocate the need for international harmonization of standards and consensus guidelines  and the majority is willing to actively engage in interlaboratory trials aiming at quality control (Figure 1). .
Family Practice,Psychiatry,,[The future role of liaison-psychiatry]. Recent reorganization of psychiatric services implies separation of psychiatric and general health care services. Liaison-psychiatry is not widely recognized in Denmark  albeit a psychiatric subspeciality in other countries. Research at the interface between psychiatric and somatic illness has resulted in significant developments in the understanding and treatment of patients with complex medical disorders. A model for the future cooperation between liaison-psychiatry  the general hospital and general practise is proposed.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Comorbidity in children with epilepsy. II: Aetiology]. A search of the literature of studies on comorbidity in children with idiopathic and cryptogenic epilepsy and its aetiology revealed few prospective longitudinal studies of evidence class II. There were too few studies on aetiology to determine the causes with certainty  but psychosocial factors seem vital  thus emphasizing the importance of information and support to the child and its family  including siblings. The cognitive and behavioural effect of antiepileptic medicine (other than phenobarbital) seems modest when AED is used monotherapeutically. Likewise  there only seems to be a modest connection between comorbidity and epilepsy-related variables such as age of onset  seizure types  EEG-changes and control of seizures.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Comorbidity in children with epilepsy. I: Behaviour problems  ADHD and intelligence]. A search of the literature of studies on comorbidity in children with idiopathic and cryptogenic epilepsy revealed very few prospective longitudinal studies. The tendency was that children with epilepsy had a greater prevalence of comorbidity than healthy children  but more prospective longitudinal studies are needed to show the exact prevalence  grade and character. Behaviour problems seem to occur before the children have seizures  i.e. the behaviour problem seems to exist before the onset of epileptic seizures. There was no sound evidence for the prevalence of comorbidity in the form of ADHD. Children with epilepsy seem to have normal IQ.
Rehabilitation,,,Testing inter-rater reliability of the Urostomy Education Scale. Previous research has validated the Urostomy Education Scale as a standardised evidence based tool to document patients' level of stoma self-care skills. The aim of this study was to test the scale's inter-rater reliability among urology nurses in a continuous validation of the Urostomy Education Scale. During the study period from June 2011 to September 2012  38 ward nurses performing standard stoma care attended 150 validation sessions evaluating 70 patients' level of stoma self-care skills using the Urostomy Education Scale. In pairs  the nurses randomly observed the patients during a training episode involving change of a stoma appliance. Data were categorised into three groups to investigate the impact of nurses' experience on reliability: comparing two inexperienced nurses  two experienced or one of each. Data were compared for agreement by testing variation between groups and analysing Bland Altman Plots with Limits of Agreement. The variation in scores was not influenced by the nurses' level of experience (p > 0.05). Reliability was found to be high with Bland Altman Plot and Limits of Agreement documenting that 84% of scores (95% CI (Confidence interval): 74; 89) were within a range of 2 points. The Urostomy Education Scale demonstrates high reliability irrespective of nurses' different levels of experience. The results are clinically relevant and contribute to a precise documentation of stoma self-care skills. The tool ensures evidence based patient education and can provide a high standard of communication in transitions between sectors.
Rehabilitation,,,Efficacy of a multiprofessional rehabilitation programme in radical cystectomy pathways: a prospective randomized controlled trial. Radical cystectomy with lymph-node dissection is a complex procedure and often followed by high postoperative morbidity and physical impairments leading to prolonged length of stay (LOS). Fast-track principles are standard procedure in radical cystectomy. Additional preoperative and postoperative physical exercises and enhanced mobilization may reduce LOS and early complications. In total  107 patients were included in a prospective randomized controlled design  50 in the intervention group (nI = 50) and 57 in the standard group (ns = 57). The standard regimen comprised regular fast-track principles. The intervention included standardized preoperative and postoperative strength and endurance exercises and progressive postoperative mobilization. The programme was initiated 2 weeks before surgery. Efficacy was expressed as a reduction in postoperative LOS. Early complications were defined as events occurring at most 90 days postoperatively and graded using the Clavien-Dindo classification system. Adherence to prehabilitation  i.e. patients who accomplished at least 75% of the programme  was 59%. Postoperative mobilization was significantly improved by walking distance (p ≤ 0.001). The ability to perform personal activities of daily living was improved by 1 day (p ≤ 0.05). The median LOS was 8 days in both treatment groups (p = 0.68). There was no significant difference between treatment groups in severity of complications (p = 0.64). There was no reduction in LOS due to the preoperative and postoperative rehabilitation programme  although enhanced mobilization was achieved. The optimized minimal surgical procedure may have affected the ability to reduce LOS further with available techniques and procedures. Alternative parameters for recovery may offer more precise and relevant information.
Rehabilitation,,,Anti-gravity training improves walking capacity and postural balance in patients with muscular dystrophy. Recent studies in patients with muscular dystrophies suggest positive effects of aerobic and strength training. These studies focused training on using bicycle ergometers and conventional strength training  which precludes more severely affected patients from participating  because of their weakness. We investigated the functional effects of combined aerobic and strength training in patients with Becker and limb-girdle muscular dystrophies with knee muscle strength levels as low as 3% of normal strength. Eight patients performed 10 weeks of aerobic and strength training on an anti-gravity treadmill  which offered weight support up to 80% of their body weight. Six minute walking distance  dynamic postural balance  and plasma creatine kinase were assessed 10 weeks prior to training  immediately before training and after 10 weeks of training. Training elicited an improvement of walking distance by 8±2% and dynamic postural balance by 13±4%  indicating an improved physical function. Plasma creatine kinase remained unchanged. These results provide evidence that a combination of aerobic and strength training during anti-gravity has the potential to safely improve functional ability in severely affected patients with Becker and limb-girdle muscular dystrophies.
Anesthesiology,,,Impact of medical training and clinical experience on the assessment of oxygenation and hypoxaemia after general anaesthesia: an observational study. In Germany it is common practice to use pulse oximetry and supplementary oxygen only on request in patients breathing spontaneously transferred to the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) following surgery under general anaesthesia. The main aim was to study the influence of medical training and clinical experience on assessing SpO(2) and detecting hypoxaemia in these patients. The second aim was to do a preliminary assessment whether this practice can be found in countries other than Germany. Anaesthetists  nurses and medical students estimated SpO(2) in patients breathing room air at the end of transfer to the PACU following surgery (including all major surgical fields) under general anaesthesia. Estimated SpO(2) was compared to SpO(2) measured by pulse oximetry. A survey was carried out among European anaesthesists concerning the use of pulse oximetry and supplementary oxygen during patient transfer to the PACU. Hypoxaemia (SpO(2) < 90 %) occurred in 154 (13.5 %) out of 1 138 patients. Anaesthetists  nurses  and medical students identified only 25  23  and 21 patients of those as being hypoxaemic  respectively. Clinical experience did not improve detection of hypoxaemia both in anaesthetists (p = 0.63) and nurses (p = 0.18). Use of pulse oximetry and supplemental oxygen during patient transfer to the PACU in European countries differs to a large extent. It seems to be applied only on request in many hospitals. Considering the uncertainty about deleterious effects of transient  short lasting hypoxaemia routine use of pulse oximetry is advocated for patient transfer to the PACU.
Hematology,,,Haemostasis and safety measures before lumbar puncture in the haematology ward: the Danish routines. Thrombocytopenia and the increasing use and variety of antithrombotic drugs is a challenge prior to lumbar puncture. This study examined the Danish haematology practice regarding drug pausation  assessment of haemostasis and whether fundoscopy is a routine safety measure. An online survey with questions pertaining to precautions of haemostasis and application of fundoscopy was sent by e-mail to all 12 haematology wards in Denmark. Eleven sites participated. Five (45%) reported no pausation of antiplatelet drugs at all. The mean platelet limit prior to lumbar puncture was 50 × 10(9)/l (range 10-50 × 10(9)/l). Seven (64%) sites had an international normalised ratio limit of 1.5  and the remaining 4 had values between 1.0 and 2.5. Two (18%) reported occasional use of thromboelastography or platelet analysis to assess the bleeding risk. Fundoscopy is routinely performed in 4 (36%) departments. We report considerable variation in the routine handling of antithrombotics and thrombocytopenia in patients set for lumbar puncture in Danish haematology departments. The diversity may be explained by and related to different opinions in the literature. Common national guidelines are warranted and there is a need for studies to establish an evidence-based approach for the management of patients at risk of bleeding when lumbar puncture or another invasive procedure is indicated.
Rehabilitation,,,Functional Independence: A Comparison of the Changes During Neurorehabilitation Between Patients With Nontraumatic Subarachnoid Hemorrhage and Patients With Intracerebral Hemorrhage or Acute Ischemic Stroke. To compare the changes in functional independence measured by the FIM after specialized neurorehabilitation between patients with nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) or acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Historical cohort study comparing changes in functional independence between patients with nontraumatic SAH and those with ICH/AIS  using FIM scores from a local database and clinical information from the Danish National Patient Registry. Postacute specialized inpatient neurorehabilitation. Participants (N=660) comprised patients with a first-time nontraumatic SAH (n=212) and age-matched patients with a first-time ICH/AIS (n=448). Not applicable. Crude and adjusted comparisons of FIM (total and item by item) measured at baseline and at discharge. Patients with nontraumatic SAH were admitted with a lower functional level compared with patients with ICH/AIS (median total FIM score  25 [interquartile range (IQR)  18-81] vs 78.5 [IQR  47-107])  and discharged with a lower functional level (median total FIM score  98 [IQR  40-116] vs 110 [IQR  82.5-119])  although they made more progress during neurorehabilitation (median change in total FIM score  27 [IQR  4-60] vs 17 [IQR  7-35]). Statistically  patients with nontraumatic SAH had significantly better odds for obtaining functional independence than did patients with ICH/AIS in 6 of the 18 FIM items: eating (odds ratio [OR]=3.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]  1.7-5.8); dressing-upper body (OR=2.0; 95% CI  1.1-3.5); transfer tub/shower (OR=2.0; 95% CI  1.1-3.6); stair walking (OR=2.2; 95% CI  1.3-3.7); comprehension (OR=2.3; 95% CI  1.3-3.9); and expression (OR=3.6; 95% CI  2.0-6.5). Patients with nontraumatic SAH made significantly more progress during neurorehabilitation  although they were discharged with a lower level of functional independence compared with patients with ICH/AIS. However  both patients with nontraumatic SAH and those with ICH/AIS improved their functional outcome significantly. Also  patients with nontraumatic SAH admitted with severe functional outcome were shown to be capable of recovering to a moderate level of functional independence.
Precision Medicine,,,Individualized Therapy Is a Long-Term Cost-Effective Method Compared to Dose Intensification in Crohn's Disease Patients Failing Infliximab. In Crohn's disease patients failing infliximab therapy  interventions defined by an algorithm based on infliximab and anti-infliximab antibody measurements have proven more cost-effective than intensifying the infliximab regimen. This study investigated long-term economic outcomes at the week 20 follow-up study visit and after 1 year. Clinical outcomes were assessed at week 20. Follow-up from a 12-week  single-blind  clinical trial where patients with infliximab treatment failure were randomized to infliximab intensification (5 mg/kg every 4 weeks) (n = 36)  or algorithm-defined interventions (n = 33). Accumulated costs  expressed as mean costs per patient  were based on the Danish National Patient Registry. At the scheduled week 20 follow-up study visit  response and remission rates were similar in all study subpopulations between patients treated by the algorithm or by infliximab intensification. However  the sum of healthcare costs related to Crohn's disease was substantially lower (31 %) for patients randomized to algorithm-based interventions than infliximab intensification in the intention-to-treat population: $11 940 versus $17 236; p = 0.005. For per-protocol patients (n = 55)  costs at the week 20 follow-up visit were even lower (49 %) in the algorithm group: $8 742 versus $17 236; p = 0.002. Figures were similar for patients having completed the 12-week trial as per protocol (50 % reduction in costs) (n = 45). Among patients continuing the allocated study intervention throughout the entire 20-week follow-up period (n = 29)  costs were reduced by 60 % in algorithm-treated patients: $7 056 versus $17 776; p < 0.001. Cost-reduction percentages remained stable throughout one year. Economic benefit of algorithm-based interventions at infliximab failure is maintained throughout 1 year.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Imaging of the major salivary glands. The major salivary glands  submandibular  parotid and sublingual glands play an important role in preserving the oral cavity and dental health. Patients with problems of the major salivary glands may present with symptoms such as dry mouth  dysphagia and obstruction of duct  inflammation  severe dental caries or swelling. Imaging plays an important role in visualization of morphology and function  to establish a diagnosis  for treatment  and for surgical planning. There are several options for diagnostic imaging: plain radiography  sialography  ultrasound (US)  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  computed tomography (CT)  salivary gland scintigraphy and (18)F-FDG positron emission tomography (PET). We present an overview of the modalities in relation to common salivary gland disease.
Forensic Medicine,,,[Suicides by poisoning investigated by the Department of Forensic Medicine  University of Aarhus  Denmark  1994-2003]. This study was performed to identify the substances used in deliberate self-poisoning and to investigate the epidemiological characteristics of these cases  with the goal of improving prevention of suicides. The material is made up of 121 cases of deliberate self-poisoning examined at the Institute of Forensic Medicine  University of Aarhus  during the years 1994-2003. The cases were subjected to a forensic autopsy and a toxicological screening for alcohol  drugs  carbon monoxide  cyanide and pesticides. This material included only 12% of the cases of deliberate self-poisoning in the area serviced by the Institute. 70% were caused by legal drugs and 17% by carbon monoxide. A total of 52 different substances were found. In one third of the cases  two or more substances were found in a lethal concentration. Analgesics and antidepressants were the most common of these. The wide range of substances used was subject to change during the period of investigation. In addition  40 different substances in therapeutic or only slightly increased concentrations were found. In most cases  the deceased was unemployed  living alone  suffering from a psychiatric disease and addicted to legal or illegal drugs or alcohol. In half the cases  there had been a previous suicide attempt. It is recommended that only small amounts of drugs be prescribed to persons in danger of committing suicide  as identified by the above-mentioned characteristics.
Molecular Epidemiology,,,Investigation of a possible outbreak of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii in Odense  Denmark using PFGE  MLST and whole-genome-based SNPs. The objectives were to study a possible outbreak of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii by comparing three different typing methods (PFGE  MLST and whole-genome SNPs) and to compare the resistance gene profiles of the isolates. From December 2012 to October 2013  eight carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii were detected at Odense University Hospital  Odense  Denmark. These isolates were typed by PFGE  with ApaI and SmaI  respectively  and subjected to WGS. The WGS data were used for in silico extraction of MLST types using two different schemes  resistance genes and SNPs  to which 31 publicly available A. baumannii genomes were added. Using ApaI  the eight isolates had four different PFGE profiles  which were further differentiated using SmaI  separating one of the profiles into two distinct PFGE types. Five ST2 (Pasteur MLST) OXA-23-producing isolates  two ST1 OXA-72-producing isolates and one ST158 OXA-23-producing isolate were detected. The five ST2 isolates were subdivided into ST195  ST208 and ST218 using the Oxford MLST scheme. The phylogenetic analysis based on the core genome showed that six of the eight Danish A. baumannii isolates were located in three distinct clusters. The two remaining isolates did not cluster with other Danish or international isolates included in the study. Isolates that clustered using PFGE  Oxford MLST and phylogenetic analysis also shared similar resistance gene profiles. The SNP profile  Oxford MLST  PFGE and resistance gene profiles clearly indicated spread of three different A. baumannii strains.
Family Practice,,,Procalcitonin versus C-reactive protein for predicting pneumonia in adults with lower respiratory tract infection in primary care. The role of procalcitonin in diagnosing bacterial infection has mainly been studied in patients with severe infections. There is no study on the value of procalcitonin measurements in adults with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) treated in primary care. To evaluate the accuracy of plasma procalcitonin in predicting radiographic pneumonia  bacterial infection  and adverse outcome in a population of adults with LRTI treated in primary care. Prospective  observational study. Forty-two general practices and an outpatient clinic at the Department of Infectious Diseases  Odense University Hospital  Denmark. A total of 364 patients with LRTI were prospectively enrolled from 42 general practices. Patients were examined with chest radiography  microbiological analyses  and measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin. The outcome measure was hospitalisation within 4 weeks of enrollment. Median procalcitonin was 0.05 ng/ml  which was below the functional sensitivity of the assay (0.06 ng/ml). In predicting radiographic pneumonia  bacterial infection  and hospitalisation  the sensitivities of procalcitonin >0.06 ng/ml were 0.70  0.51  and 0.67  and of CRP were > or =20 mg/l  0.73  0.56  and 0.74 respectively. Corresponding positive predictive values were between 0.09 and 0.28. Both procalcitonin >0.06 ng/ml and CRP > or =20 mg/l were associated with radiographic pneumonia  bacterial infection  and subsequent hospitalisation  but positive predictive values were too low for any of the two inflammatory markers to be of use in clinical practice. To measure procalcitonin values accurately in the primary care setting  a more sensitive method is needed  but there was no indication that procalcitonin is superior to CRP in identifying patients with pneumonia  bacterial aetiology  or adverse outcome.
Telemedicine,,,EHealth: self-management in inflammatory bowel disease and in irritable bowel syndrome using novel constant-care web applications. EHealth by constant-care in IBD and IBS. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are chronic gastrointestinal disorders of unknown aetiology of increasing incidence and changing disease activity or severity. Approximately 60-80% of IBD patients suffer from IBS. Monitoring and treatment goals of IBD are to optimise the disease course by prolonging remission periods and preventing or shortening periods of active disease. Constant-care web-monitoring and treatment approaches with active patient involvement have been proven effective in UC  increasing patients' adherence and improving the disease outcomes.   To assess the feasibility and efficacy of the novel constant-care eHealth applications in: i) CD patients treated with infliximab (IFX)  ii) UC patients with active disease on mesalazine  iii) IBS patients and iv) IBD patients with IBS on a low FODMAP diet (LFD).   New constant-care web applications www.cd.constant-care.dk  www.meza.constant-care.dk and www.ibs.constant-care.dk in IBD patients were developed and assessed in this thesis. An integrated inflammatory burden measure of disease activity  consisting of a subjective (clinical indices) and of an objective (faecal calprotectin) part and a treatment guide to drug doses and intervals  was incorporated into the web applications and used by patients. Web-guided IFX treatment in CD demonstrated patients' inter- and intra-individual variability in infusion intervals and provided patients with individualised treatment according to their needs. Web-guided treatment with multimatrix mesalazine was efficacious in a majority of UC patients with mild-to-moderate disease activity. Web-guided IBS-monitoring in IBD and in IBS patients on LFD was shown to be a feasible method that actively involved patients in their disease management and had a positive short-term impact on the disease. Moreover  the new constant-care concepts were demonstrated to be safe and to have a positive impact on quality of life and adherence to treatment and helped to reduce the costs.   The novel constant-care web applications have proven feasible in improving the disease outcomes in CD patients on IFX  in UC patients on mesalazine  and in monitoring IBS. These applications are expected to be implemented in the clinical practice of gastroenterology in Denmark in the coming years. Future studies will help to assess whether the natural disease course can be improved in the long-term.
Telemedicine,,,Ehealth monitoring in irritable bowel syndrome patients treated with low fermentable oligo-  di-  mono-saccharides and polyols diet. In the present study we report on changes in irritable bowel syndrome-severity scoring system (IBS-SSS) and irritable bowel syndrome-quality of life (IBS-QoL) in 19 IBS patients  aged 18 to 74 years (F/M: 14/5)  during 12 wk registering their symptoms on the web-application (www.ibs.constant-care.dk). During a control period of the first 6-wk patients were asked to register their IBS-SSS and IBS-QoL on the web-application weekly without receiving any intervention. Thereafter  low fermentable oligo-  di-  mono-saccharides and polyols (FODMAP) diet (LFD) was introduced for the next 6 wk while continuing the registration. Though a small sample size a significant improvement in disease activity (IBS-SSS) was observed during both the control period  median: 278 (range: 122-377)  P = 0.02  and subsequently during the LFD period  median: 151 (range: 29-334)  P < 0.01. The IBS-QoL solely changed significantly during the LFD period  median: 67 (37-120)  P < 0.01. The significant reduction in disease activity during the control period shows a positive effect of the web-application on IBS symptoms when presented as a "traffic light". However adding the diet reduced IBS-SSS to < 150  inactive to mild symptoms. In the future results from larger scale trials are awaited.
Public Health,,,Open source non-invasive prenatal testing platform and its performance in a public health laboratory. The objective of this study was to introduce non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for fetal autosomal trisomies and gender in a Danish public health setting  using semi-conductor sequencing and published open source scripts for analysis. Plasma-derived DNA from a total of 375 pregnant women (divided into three datasets) was whole-genome sequenced on the Ion Proton™ platform and analyzed using a pipeline based on WISECONDOR for fetal autosomal aneuploidy detection and SeqFF for fetal DNA fraction estimation. We furthermore validated a fetal sex determination analysis. The pipeline correctly detected 27/27 trisomy 21  4/4 trisomy 18  and 3/3 trisomy 13 fetuses. Neither false negatives nor false positives (chromosomes 13  18  and 21) were observed in our validation dataset. Fetal sex was identified correctly in all but one triploid fetus (172/173). SeqFF showed a strong correlation (R(2)  = 0.72) to Y-chromosomal content of the male fetus samples. We have implemented NIPT into Danish health care using published open source scripts for autosomal aneuploidy detection and fetal DNA fraction estimation showing excellent false negative and false positive rates. SeqFF provides a good estimation of fetal DNA fraction. This coupled with an analysis of fetal sex that provides a complete NIPT workflow  which may easily be adapted for implementation in other public health laboratories. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons  Ltd.
Perinatology,,,The Danish Fetal Medicine Database: establishment  organization and quality assessment of the first trimester screening program for trisomy 21 in Denmark 2008-2012. To describe the establishment and organization of the Danish Fetal Medicine Database and to report national results of first-trimester combined screening for trisomy 21 in the 5-year period 2008-2012. National register study using prospectively collected first-trimester screening data from the Danish Fetal Medicine Database. Pregnant women in Denmark undergoing first-trimester screening for trisomy 21. Data on maternal characteristics  biochemical and ultrasonic markers are continuously sent electronically from local fetal medicine databases (Astraia Gmbh software) to a central national database. Data are linked to outcome data from the National Birth Register  the National Patient Register and the National Cytogenetic Register via the mother's unique personal registration number. First-trimester screening data from 2008 to 2012 were retrieved. Screening performance was assessed for the years 2008-2012 by calculating detection rates and screen-positive rates. A total of 268 342 first-trimester risk assessments for trisomy 21 were performed in singleton pregnancies. Participation rate in first-trimester screening was >90%. The national screen-positive rate increased from 3.6% in 2008 to 4.7% in 2012. The national detection rate of trisomy 21 was reported to be between 82 and 90% in the 5-year period. A national fetal medicine database has been successfully established in Denmark. Results from the database have shown that at a national level first-trimester screening performance for trisomy 21 is high with a low screen-positive rate and a high detection rate.
Medical Oncology,,,From clinical practice guidelines  to clinical guidance in practice--implications for design of computerized guidance. This paper presents a case study of clinical guidance within oncology clinics. Close to all patients treated within the observed clinics were treated according to a research or standard treatment protocol. The protocol artifacts were however rarely applied in clinical practice instead we found an extensive application of what we have named second order guiding artifacts. The deployed protocols underwent a local adaptation and transformation process when initiated. The protocols were adapted to match the local resources and transformed into several activity specific second order guiding artifacts. The transformation from protocols was executed according to a standard operating procedure. Each activity type had a standardized template ensuring uniformity across second order guiding artifacts within a clinic. The guiding artifacts were multi-functional and a wide variety of standardized graphical attributes were applied to support effortless appliance. The implications for computerization of clinical practice guidelines are discussed.
Health Occupations,,,Endotoxins isolated from the air of a Danish paper mill and the relation to change in lung function: an 11-year follow-up. A decline in lung function has been associated with farming  cotton spinning  and work in the animal feed industry. The aim of the study was to reveal if loss of lung function was associated to work at a paper mill. Ninety-seven male paper workers (PW)  and 55 control workers were examined. Hygiene samples included total dust  endotoxins  and microorganisms. Interview  pulmonary function testing  and skin prick test (SPT) were performed and yearly decline in lung function was calculated. The exposure for endotoxin (LPS) ranged from Median (Max-Min) 69 (370-6) EU/m3  in the wet-end of the paper machines to 6 (19-16) in the pulping area. The lung function decline among the controls was comparable to the decrements among the maintenance and repair workers at the paper factory  around 51-54 and 37-38 ml/year among smokers' and non-smokers  respectively. After adjustment for baseline FEV1  the variables associated to an increased loss of FEV1 were age smoking and cough. For FVC we found an inverse relation between exposure and yearly decline. No increase in loss of lung function is seen among workers exposed to up to 200 EU/m3 of LPS.
Family Practice,,,[Quality of pharma rep meetings in general practice]. For many general practitioners (GPs)  visits from pharmaceutical representatives (reps) are common settings for receiving updated drug information. We here aim to describe the content and assess the quality of information provided by reps visiting Norwegian GPs. Medical students filled in a questionnaire addressing one pharma rep visit they had experienced during their 6-week general practice period in their fifth year at medical school in Oslo (2001 and 2002). Students from three classes participated and 144/241 (60 %) of them returned completed questionnaires. The 144 pharma rep meetings addressed 64 different and mostly new drugs  most commonly cardiovascular and pulmonary preparations. The visit was most commonly conducted during a free lunch (90 %) for the entire practice staff (81 %). The representatives offered the GPs free drug samples (41 %)  and small presents (44 %). Four of five visits were characterized by incomplete or lacking information about side effects  interactions  contraindications or precautions for using the drug. The students scored their educational benefit from the session on a visual analogue scale from 0 (poor) to 10 (excellent)  which revealed a mean score of less than neutral  4.2. The systematic omittance of important safety information  emphasizes the need for industry unbiased continuing medical drug education in general practice.
Medical Oncology,,,Position paper of the Italian Association of Medical Oncology on early palliative care in oncology practice (Simultaneous Care). One of the priorities of personalized medicine regards the role of early integration of palliative care with cancer-directed treatments  called simultaneous care. This article  written by the Italian Association of Medical Oncology (AIOM) Simultaneous and Continuous Care Task Force  represents the position of Italian medical oncologists about simultaneous care  and is the result of a 2-step project: a Web-based survey among medical oncologists and a consensus conference. We present the opinion of more than 600 oncologists who helped formulate these recommendations. This document covers 4 main aspects of simultaneous care: 1) ethical  cultural  and relational aspects of cancer and implications for patient communication; 2) training of medical oncologists in palliative medicine; 3) research on the integration between cancer treatments and palliative care; and 4) organizational and management models for the realization of simultaneous care. The resulting recommendations highlight the role of skills and competence in palliative care along with implementation of adequate organizational models to accomplish simultaneous care  which is considered a high priority of AIOM in order to grant the best quality of life for cancer patients and their families.
Neurosurgery,,,Coagulation during elective neurosurgery with hydroxyethyl starch fluid therapy: an observational study with thromboelastometry  fibrinogen and factor XIII. Several studies have described hypercoagulability in neurosurgery with craniotomy for brain tumor resection. In this study  hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 130/0.42 was used for hemodynamic stabilization and initial blood loss replacement. HES can induce coagulopathy with thromboelastographic signs of decreased clot strength. The aim of this study was to prospectively describe perioperative changes in coagulation during elective craniotomy for brain tumor resection with the present fluid regimen. Forty patients were included. Perioperative whole-blood samples were collected for EXTEM and FIBTEM assays on rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) and plasma fibrinogen analysis immediately before surgery  after 1 L of HES infusion  at the end of surgery and in the morning after surgery. Factor (F)XIII activity  thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) and plasmin-α2-antiplasmin complex (PAP) were analysed in the 25 patients receiving ≥1 L of HES. Most patients (37 of 40) received HES infusion (0.5-2 L) during surgery. Preoperative ROTEM clot formation/structure  plasma fibrinogen and FXIII levels were generally within normal range but approached a hypocoagulant state during and at end of surgery. ROTEM variables and fibrinogen levels  but not FXIII  returned to baseline levels in the morning after surgery. Low perioperative fibrinogen levels were common. TAT levels were increased during and after surgery. PAP levels mostly remained within the reference ranges  not indicating excessive fibrinolysis. There were no differences in ROTEM results and fibrinogen levels in patients receiving <1 L HES and ≥1 L HES. Only the increased TAT levels indicated an intra- and postoperative activation of coagulation. On the contrary  all other variables deteriorated towards hypocoagulation but were mainly normalized in the morning after surgery. Although this might be an effect of colloid-induced coagulopathy  we found no dose-dependent effect of HES. The unactivated fibrinolysis indicates that prophylactic use of tranexamic acid does not seem warranted under normal circumstances in elective neurosurgery. Individualized fluid therapy and coagulation factor substitution is of interest for future studies.
Audiology,,,Measuring elevated intracranial pressure through noninvasive methods: a review of the literature. Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is an important cause of secondary brain injury  and a measurement of ICP is often of crucial value in neurosurgical and neurological patients. The gold standard for ICP monitoring is through an intraventricular catheter  but this invasive technique is associated with certain risks. Intraparenchymal ICP monitoring methods are considered to be a safer alternative but can  in certain conditions  be imprecise due to zero drift and still require an invasive procedure. An accurate noninvasive method to measure elevated ICP would therefore be desirable. This article is a review of the current literature on noninvasive methods for measuring and evaluating elevated ICP. The main focus is on studies that compare noninvasively measured ICP with invasively measured ICP. The aim is to provide an overview of the current state of the most common noninvasive techniques available. Several methods for noninvasive measuring of elevated ICP have been proposed: radiologic methods including computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging  transcranial Doppler  electroencephalography power spectrum analysis  and the audiological and ophthalmological techniques. The noninvasive methods have many advantages  but remain less accurate compared with the invasive techniques. None of the noninvasive techniques available today are suitable for continuous monitoring  and they cannot be used as a substitute for invasive monitoring. They can  however  provide a reliable measurement of the ICP and be useful as screening methods in select patients  especially when invasive monitoring is contraindicated or unavailable.
General Practice,,,Enhanced implementation of low back pain guidelines in general practice: study protocol of a cluster randomised controlled trial. Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines may improve treatment quality  but the uptake of guideline recommendations is often incomplete and slow. Recently new low back pain guidelines are being launched in Denmark. The guidelines are considered to reduce personal and public costs. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether a complex  multifaceted implementation strategy of the low back pain guidelines will reduce secondary care referral and improve patient outcomes compared to the usual simple implementation strategy. In a two-armed cluster randomised trial  100 general practices (clusters) and 2 700 patients aged 18 to 65 years from the North Denmark region will be included. Practices are randomly allocated 1:1 to a simple or a complex implementation strategy. Intervention practices will receive a complex implementation strategy  including guideline facilitator visits  stratification tools  and quality reports on low back pain treatment. Primary outcome is referral to secondary care. Secondary outcomes are pain  physical function  health-related quality of life  patient satisfaction with care and treatment outcome  employment status  and sick leave. Primary and secondary outcomes pertain to the patient level. Assessments of outcomes are blinded and follow the intention-to-treat principle. Additionally  a process assessment will evaluate the degree to which the intervention elements will be delivered as planned  as well as measure changes in beliefs and behaviours among general practitioners and patients. This study provides knowledge concerning the process and effect of an intervention to implement low back pain guidelines in general practice  and will provide insight on essential elements to include in future implementation strategies in general practice. Registered as NCT01699256 on ClinicalTrials.gov.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Exploring the evidence base for national and regional policy interventions to combat resistance. The effectiveness of existing policies to control antimicrobial resistance is not yet fully understood. A strengthened evidence base is needed to inform effective policy interventions across countries with different income levels and the human health and animal sectors. We examine three policy domains-responsible use  surveillance  and infection prevention and control-and consider which will be the most effective at national and regional levels. Many complexities exist in the implementation of such policies across sectors and in varying political and regulatory environments. Therefore  we make recommendations for policy action  calling for comprehensive policy assessments  using standardised frameworks  of cost-effectiveness and generalisability. Such assessments are especially important in low-income and middle-income countries  and in the animal and environmental sectors. We also advocate a One Health approach that will enable the development of sensitive policies  accommodating the needs of each sector involved  and addressing concerns of specific countries and regions.
Forensic Medicine,,,Discrepancy between information reported by the victims of sexual assaults and clinical forensic findings. From the clinical forensic examination reports made at the Department of Forensic Medicine  the University of Copenhagen  in 2007 concerning rape  attempted rape and sexual assault (RAS)  information about the assault  including both violence and the perpetrator's line of sexual action was extracted  analysed and compared to the observed lesions (LE). A total of 184 girls and women were included in this retrospective study. 75.5% of the victims were under 30 years of age. Observed LE: 79% had observed LE. 41% had body LE only  19% genito-anal LE only  and 40% had both body and genito-anal LE. Half of the victims  who reported no exposure to violence  had body LE. Five victims also had LE of a self-inflicted character. Genito-anal LE: 47% had genito-anal LE  64% of whom had one or two  commonest a tear. Body LE: 64% had body LE. 57% was caused by slight  blunt force. Information on line of sexual action was present in 148 cases. A total of 123 victims reported penetration: 94% vaginal  16% anal and 20% oral. Three were exposed to anal penetration only. Eleven perpetrators used a condom. 50% of the cases with vaginal and/or anal penetration had genito-anal LE. Victims with both vaginal and anal penetration and victims who reported more than one perpetrator did not show more genito-anal LE. Anal penetration or attempted anal penetration has increased to 21% of cases. Young victims are exposed to RAS. Half of them have genito-anal LE  typically one. Anal penetration or attempted anal penetration is increasing. This will often cause genito-anal LE. This finding stresses the importance that these examinations take place where both forensic and health-care expertise are offered. not relevant. not relevant.
Forensic Medicine,,,Forensic odontological examinations of alleged torture victims at the University of Copenhagen 1997-2011. Clinical forensic examinations of alleged torture victims have been performed by forensic pathologists at the University of Copenhagen since 1995. In 13.2%/33 of these cases the examinations were supplemented by a forensic odontological clinical examination. In this study the forensic odontological cases from the years 1997-2011 are presented and discussed. This study includes 33 reports from alleged torture victims (4 females  29 males) who have been examined by a forensic odontologist at the Copenhagen School of Dentistry in the years 1997-2011.The material available consisted of copies of medical forensic reports and the forensic odontological reports including x-rays. BACKGROUND data  anamnestic data and results of the forensic odontological clinical examinations were registered as well as the conclusion of the clinical examinations. The forensic odontological clinical examinations were complicated by the presence of unspecific injuries and various degrees of active oral pathology. In 27 of the cases it was concluded that the findings were consistent with the alleged torture  in six of the cases the findings were concluded to be highly consistent with the alleged torture.
Forensic Pathology,,,Abandonment of newborn infants: a Danish forensic medical survey 1997-2008. Concealment of pregnancy and newborn infant abandonment are closely associated with neonaticide  the killing of an infant within the first 24 h of life or less than 28-30 days depending on the jurisdiction. Abandonment of newborn infants occurs throughout the world and often the outcome for the infant is death. Together with neonaticide it is felt to be one of the least preventable crimes. In this retrospective study we present all forensically known Danish cases of abandoned newborn infant corpses  covering the period from 1997 to 2008. Eleven newborn infant corpses were found; we registered characteristics of the newborn infants and the circumstances of the cases based on autopsy reports. One further newborn infant was included  dating back to 1992  as it was found to be connected with one of the later cases. The mean age of the women who abandoned their newborn infants was 22 years  and five of the autopsied newborn infants were probably alive when abandoned. In two cases the newborn infants were half siblings and abandoned by the same mother. The time span from abandonment to when the newborn infant was found ranged from hours to 7 years. Two-thirds of the newborn infants were girls (66.6%). The most common means of disposal was in a plastic bag (~60%); only one newborn infant was wearing clothes when found. Causes of death were usually given as asphyxia  brain injury or simply undetermined. Two-thirds of the newborn infants showed signs of violence. None of the newborn infants had congenital malformations.
Forensic Toxicology,,,An oxcarbazepine-related fatality with an overview of 26 oxcarbazepine postmortem cases. We present an oxcarbazepine-related fatality together with an overview of 26 postmortem cases involving oxcarbazepine observed during the period 2001-2006. The fatality case concerned a 27-year-old woman with epilepsy  who was found dead in her bed. Oxcarbazepine and its active metabolite  10-hydroxycarbazepine  were the only compounds detected. The concentrations of oxcarbazepine were as follows: femoral blood  2.9mg/kg; muscle  1.8mg/kg; liver  0.9mg/kg; gastric content (300ml)  860mg/kg; and vitreous humour  not detected. The concentrations of 10-hydroxycarbazepine were as follows: femoral blood  66mg/kg; muscle  40mg/kg; liver  62mg/kg; gastric content  27mg/kg; and vitreous humour  25mg/kg. The analyses were performed by HPLC-DAD after liquid-liquid extraction. Oxcarbazepine intoxication was regarded as a possible cause of death. For the other 26 cases  the 10-hydroxycarbazepine concentrations ranged from 2.2 to 48mg/kg with a median of 25mg/kg.
General Practice,,,Daytime use of general practice and use of the out-of-hours primary care service for patients with chronic disease: a cohort study. The importance of proactive chronic care has become increasingly evident. Yet  it is unknown whether the use of general practice (GP) during daytime may affect the use of Out-of-Hours (OOH) Primary Care Service for people with chronic disease. We aimed to analyse the association between use of daytime general practice (GP) and use of OOH services for heart disease  lung disease  diabetes  psychiatric disease  or cancer. In particular  we intended to study the association between OOH contacts due to chronic disease exacerbation and recent use of daytime GP. Data comprised a random sample of contacts to the OOH services ('LV-KOS2011'). Included patients were categorised into the following chronic diseases: heart disease  lung disease  diabetes  psychiatric disease  or cancer. Information on face-to-face contacts to daytime GP was obtained from the Danish National Health Insurance Service Registry and information about exacerbation or new episodes from the LVKOS2011 survey. Associations between number of regular daytime consultations and annual follow-up consultations during one  three  six  and 12 months prior to index contacts  and outcomes of interest were estimated by using logistic regression. In total  11 897 patients aged ≥ 18 years were included. Of these  2 665 patients (22.4%) were identified with one of the five selected chronic diseases; 673 patients (5.7%) had two or more. A higher odds ratio (OR) for exacerbation as reason for encounter (RFE) at the index contact was observed among patients with psychiatric disease (OR = 2.15) and cancer (OR = 2.17) than among other patients for ≥2 daytime recent contacts. When receiving an annual follow-up  exacerbation OR at index contact lowered for patients with lung disease (OR = 0.68)  psychiatric disease (OR = 0.42)  or ≥2 diseases (OR = 0.61). Recent and frequent use of daytime GP for patients with the selected chronic diseases was associated with contacts to the OOH services due to exacerbation. These findings indicate that the most severely chronically ill patients tend to make more use of general practice. The provision of an annual follow-up daytime GP consultation may indicate a lower risk of contacting OOH due to exacerbation.
General Practice,,,Cancer suspicion in general practice  urgent referral and time to diagnosis: a population-based GP survey and registry study. Many countries have implemented standardised cancer patient pathways (CPPs) to ensure fast diagnosis of patients suspected of having cancer. Yet  studies are sparse on the impact of such CPPs  and few have distinguished between referral routes. For incident cancer patients  we aimed to determine how often GPs suspected cancer at the time of first presentation of symptoms in general practice and to describe the routes of referral for further investigation. In addition  we aimed to analyse if the GP's suspicion of cancer could predict the choice of referral to a CPP. Finally  we aimed to analyse associations between not only cancer suspicion and time to cancer diagnosis  but also between choice of referral route and time to cancer diagnosis. We conducted a population-based  cross-sectional study of incident cancer patients in Denmark who had attended general practice prior to their diagnosis of cancer. Data were collected from GP questionnaires and national registers. We estimated the patients' chance of being referred to a CPP (prevalence ratio (PR)) using Poisson regression. Associations between the GP's symptom interpretation  use of CPP and time to diagnosis were estimated using quantile regression. 5 581 questionnaires were returned (response rate: 73.8%). A GP was involved in diagnosing the cancer in 4 101 (73.5%) cases (3 823 cases analysed). In 48.2% of these cases  the GP interpreted the patient's symptoms as 'alarm' symptoms suggestive of cancer. The GP used CPPs in 1 426 (37.3%) cases. Patients  who had symptoms interpreted as 'vague' had a lower chance of being referred to a CPP than when interpreted as 'alarm' symptoms (PR = 0.53 (95%CI: 0.48;0.60)). Patients with 'vague' symptoms had a 34 (95% CI: 28;41) days longer median time to diagnosis than patients with 'alarm' symptoms. GPs suspect cancer more often than they initiate a CPP  and patients were less likely to be referred to a CPP when their symptoms were not interpreted as alarm symptoms of cancer. The GP's choice of referral route was a strong predictor of the duration of the diagnostic interval  but the GP's symptom interpretation was approximately twice as strong an indicator of a longer diagnostic interval.
General Practice,,,A feasible method to study the Danish out-of-hours primary care service. The primary care out-of-hours (OOH) service is of considerable importance; it is the main provider of freely accessible medical advice outside daytime hours  and it covers 75% of the active time in the health-care system. Although the OOH handles three million contacts annually  only little is known about the reasons for encounter  the performed clinical work and the patient perspectives. During a one-year period (2010-2011)  data on patient contacts were collected using pop-up questionnaires integrated into the existing IT system. The questions explored the contents and characteristics of patient contacts. A paper-based questionnaire was sent to the included patients. Of all 700 general practitioners (GP) on duty  383 (54.7%) participated at least once  and the participating GPs were representative of all GPs. In total  21 457 contacts were registered; and the distribution of patient  contact and GP characteristics in OOH contacts was similar to the background contacts. Telephone consultations were most often offered to children and home visits primarily to elderly patients. The patient response rate was 51.2%. Females comprised the majority of the included contacts and of the respondents in the patient survey. The method was highly feasible for generating a representative sample of contacts to OOH services. The project has formed a substantial and valid basis for further studies and future research in the OOH service.

Pathology  Clinical,,,Cytopathologic diagnoses of fine-needle aspirations from endoscopic ultrasound of the mediastinum: reproducibility of the diagnoses and representativeness of aspirates from lymph nodes. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy through the esophagus (EUS-FNA) or the bronchial tree (endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial needle aspiration [EBUS-TBNA]) may be used to obtain specimens from mediastinal structures. The accuracy of this procedure has been well documented. However  no studies have studied the reproducibility of the pathologic assessment of the aspirated material. A total of 102 slides from EUS-FNA or EBUS-TBNA were assessed 2 times by 4 pathologists who classified each slide to 1 of 5 diagnostic categories and judged if the aspirate came from a lymph node. Between the 2 rounds the criteria to be used in the assessment of the slides were reviewed in a limited education session. The 4 observers had at least 15 years of pathology experience  but their experience in EUS-FNA and/or EBUS-TBNA varied from almost none to more than 10 years. The kappa statistic was applied for the analysis of reproducibility. The reproducibility of the diagnoses in the first round was good to excellent (kappa  0.52-0.89). The teaching session led to a significant improvement of the reproducibility between the least and the most experienced observers (kappa ranges of 0.52-0.55 in the first round improved to 0.65-0.71 in the second round). The reproducibility of the diagnosis on EBUS-TBNA and EUS-FNA is excellent among pathologists experienced with these types of samples. Pathologists who are generally experienced but have little experience with EBUS-TBNA and EUS-FNA show a steep learning curve. From a pathologic point of view  EBUS-TBNA and EUS-FNA are feasible  but only experienced pathologists should do the assessments.
Medicine,Specialization,,[Specialised palliative medicine...why  where and how?]. Palliative medicine is the medical part of total palliative care and has been a specialty of its own in United Kingdom since 1987. The development of palliative care has been slower in Denmark. The Danish Medical Association for Palliative Medicine was founded in 2001 and in 2003 initiated a theoretical specialist course in palliative medicine with participants from the 5 Nordic countries. Hospices and specialist palliative teams have been established but there is a great need for development of palliative care in hospitals and in the primary care  and a huge need for education and training of professionals  including doctors.
Aerospace Medicine,,,Upper Respiratory Infections and Barotrauma Among Commercial Pilots. Health incapacitation is a serious threat to flight safety. Therefore  a study conducted 10 yr ago examined the incidents of ear-nose-throat (ENT) barotrauma and upper respiratory infection (URI) among commercial pilots and found that a large number continued to carry out their duties despite the risk of incapacitation. Now  10 yr later  this new study examines if the attention to URIs has improved. This study was conducted at the Danish Aeromedical Centre over the course of 1 yr with 463 valid respondents to a questionnaire on URIs and ENT barotrauma. These respondents were compared to 940 respondents answering the same questionnaire 10 yr prior in the same setting. This study shows a significant increase in the number of pilots flying despite signs of an URI from 42.8 to 50.1% and in the number of pilots using decongestant medicine from 43.3 to 59.5%. The proportion of pilots experiencing one or more ENT barotraumas has also increased from 37.4 to 55.5% for barotitis media and from 19.5 to 27.9% for barosinusitis. Half of all pilots in this study fly despite signs of an URI. This is a significant increase and shows that after 10 yr an URI is still not considered a valid reason for reporting in sick despite international aeromedical recommendation. Based on these findings  the study recommends that awareness of the risk of flying with an URI be increased.Boel NM  Klokker M. Upper respiratory infections and barotrauma among commercial pilots. Aerosp Med Hum Perform. 2017; 88(1):17-22.
Aerospace Medicine,,,Upper respiratory infections and barotraumas in commercial pilots: a retrospective survey. One of the most common causes of acute incapacitation among aircrew is barotrauma induced by pressure changes during descent in aviation. However  the incidence of ENT barotrauma during flight among commercial pilots with or without upper respiratory infections (URI) has not been described in detail. There were 948 commercial pilots--equivalent to one-third of all commercial pilots in Denmark--visiting the Danish Aero Medical Centre during a 6-mo period who answered a questionnaire regarding signs and symptoms of URI and barotrauma incidence in relation to flying with a common cold. On average  every commercial pilot experienced one to two URI per year. About two-thirds of the pilots (57.2%) reported themselves unfit  while 42.8% continued with their flying duties despite signs and symptoms of a URI. Of the latter group the 78.0% reported taking decongestant medication. More than one-third of all pilots (37.6%) reported having experienced one or more episodes of ear barotrauma  mainly during descent (90%)  whereas 19.5% reported one or more sinus barotrauma incidents during their flying career. Less than 2% of these had felt incapacitated prior to the flight. The results suggest that not all pilots and airline companies consider URI a valid reason for unfitness to fly despite the risk for acute incapacitation. Urgent attention to this fact and to the risk factors caused by URI are strongly recommended.
Aerospace Medicine,,,Pressure-equalizing earplugs do not prevent barotrauma on descent from 8000 ft cabin altitude. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of pressure-equalizing earplugs available in major airports and drugstores. No previous study has focused on preventing barotrauma using these earplugs. Blinded and double-blinded  one type of pressure-equalizing earplugs (JetEars) was studied in 27 volunteers disposed to ear barotrauma. They acted as their own controls with an active earplug in one ear and a placebo earplug in the other ear at random. All were exposed to the same well-defined pressure profile for 1 h at 8000 ft  comparable to the environment in civil commercial air travel in a pressurized cabin. Satisfaction was assessed by questionnaire and objective results were evaluated prior to and after the pressure exposure by tympanometry and otoscopy using the Teed classification. The majority of the volunteers (78%) reported a pleasant noise-reducing feeling using the earplugs. However  75% also experienced ear pain during descent. In comparing the middle ear pressure before and after pressurization  a decrease was found in ears with both active earplugs and placebo earplugs. No difference between the active and the placebo earplugs were found. Furthermore  after evaluation of the two groups of ears using otoscopy  no prevention of barotrauma was found. In fact  the ears using an active pressure-equalizing earplug scored significantly worse (p = 0.033). Feelings of noise reduction were reported  but no prevention of barotrauma could be demonstrated with the use of pressure-equalizing earplugs. Pressure-equalizing earplugs cannot be recommended in air travel for preventing ear barotrauma.
Aerospace Medicine,,,Perilymphatic fistula in cabin attendants: an incapacitating consequence of flying with common cold. A perilymphatic fistula (PLF) is an abnormal communication between the inner ear and the middle ear that leaks perilymph. PLF is considered rare  but is known to occur during childbirth  straining  weightlifting  head trauma  and diving with middle ear equalizing problems. It has also  anecdotally  been described in connection with flying. The symptoms are uncharacteristic vertigo and  in some cases  hearing impairment and tinnitus. This study describes four cases of PLF during a period of 6 mo in a major Scandinavian airline company employing approximately 3000 cabin attendants (CAs). None of the cases were diagnosed at the primary health care level. All were referred to the Aviation Medical Center for investigation. The PLF diagnosis was based on the case history  Platform Pressure Test (a fistula test)  and other vestibular tests. Only one CA has been able to return to flying duties. The article emphasizes the risk of flying with poor middle ear equalization and the necessity of reminding crews and airline companies to "never fly with a common cold".
General Practice,Psychiatry,,Where are patients who have co-occurring mental and physical diseases located? Patients with a psychiatric illness have a higher prevalence of physical diseases and thus a higher morbidity and mortality. The main aim was to investigate where patients with co-occurring physical diseases and mental disorders (psychotic spectrum or mood) in the health and social service system are identified most frequently before admission into psychiatry. The second aim was to compare the differences in the treatment routes taken by the patients before entry into psychiatric services in all the participating countries (Denmark  Germany  Japan  Nigeria and Switzerland). On admission to a psychiatric service  patients diagnosed with schizophrenia  schizotypal or delusional disorders (International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) group F2) or mood (affective) disorders (ICD-10 group F3) and a co-morbid physical condition (cardiovascular disease  diabetes mellitus and overweight) were asked with which institutions or persons they had been in contact with in the previous 6 months. Patients from Denmark  Germany and Switzerland with mental disorders had almost the same contact pattern. Their primary contact was to public or private psychiatry  with a contact percentage of 46%-91%; in addition  general practice was a common contact  with a margin of 41%-93%. Similar tendencies are seen in Japan despite the small sample size. With regard to general practice  this is also the case with Nigerian patients. However  religious guidance or healing was rarely sought by patients in Europe and Japan  while in Nigeria about 80% of patients with mental disorders had contacted this type of service. Promoting prophylactic work between psychiatry and the general practice sector may be beneficial in diminishing physical conditions such as cardiovascular disease  diabetes mellitus and overweight in patients with mental disorders in European countries and Japan. In Nigeria (a low-to-middle-income country)  religious guides or healers  along with general practitioners  are the most frequently contacted  and they therefore seem to be the most obvious partner to collaborate with.
Biomedical Engineering,,,Wall shear stress variations in basilar tip aneurysms investigated with computational fluid dynamics. Hemodynamics are thought to play an important role in the creation  thrombosis  recanalization  regrowth and re-bleeding of cerebral aneurysms treated by endovascular means. However  their exact role and interaction is unclear and warrants further study. Towards a systematic classification of the hemodynamics in intracranial aneurysms  we investigated the dependence of the values of the magnitude of the wall shear stresses in the vicinity of the aneurysm on varying inflow conditions in three basilar tip aneurysms.
Family Practice,,,[Frequent attenders in general practice. Who are they and how are they managed?]. Frequent attenders (FAs) account for a large number of the consultations and a large part of the workload in general practice. We need knowledge about the way general practitioners (GPs) characterise this group of patients and about their proposals for clinical management. This study aims to describe the types of FAs seen in general practice and their proposed management. Six randomly sampled CME groups in Aarhus County were offered a meeting about frequent attendance in general practice  and five groups with a total of 89 GPs accepted. FAs were defined as the top 10% patients attending during 12 months. One week before the meeting  each GP received an introduction to the meeting and the names of two FAs listed with the practice. Through exploratory focus group interviews  supplemented by a small group-based CME method  the GPs were asked to discuss FA characteristics and to make proposals for clinical management. A total of 59 (66.3%) participated in the five meetings. Eight FA types consistently emerged from the discussions  and the GPs suggested 12 possible ways of managing them. These aspects involved communicative  organisational (planning)  and biopsychosocial skills. The variety of types shows that FAs are not solely the so-called difficult patients  but a diverse group demanding many different aspects of care. Hence  the GPs are in a key position demanding specific skills to manage these patients.
Global Health,,,Malignancy in routine tonsillectomy specimens: a systematic literature review. The aim of this systematic literature review was to investigate the prevalence of unsuspected tonsillar malignancy in routine tonsillectomy specimens and to discuss whether histological examination is indicated in tonsillectomy specimens from patients without well-defined risk factors. PRISMA 2009 guidelines were considered and applied whenever possible. Articles on prevalence of unsuspected tonsillar malignancy in routine tonsillectomy specimens were selected. Unsuspected tonsillar malignancy was defined as a malignant histological diagnosis after routine tonsillectomy without the presence of the following risk factors: tonsillar asymmetry  visible lesion  tonsillar firmness  cervical adenopathy  unexpected weight loss and constitutional symptoms  history of malignancy  previous radiotherapy  or immunodeficiency. We identified 37 articles comprising 72 322 patients. A total of 11 patients (0.015 %) had unsuspected malignancy. Considering the adult population only  12 studies including 6 434 patients were identified. Three patients (0.05 %) had unsuspected malignancy. Regarding paediatric data  21 studies including 21 223 children were identified. Three children (0.01 %) had unsuspected malignancy. The rarity of unsuspected malignancy in clinically benign tonsils fails to provide adequate justification for routine histological examination. National guidelines or statements by ENT societies are warranted.
Internal Medicine,,,Poor quality of referral from mental to somatic hospitals. Concomitant somatic and mental illness is associated with excess mortality compared with the general population. To prevent this  a number of health initiatives relating to somatic illness in psychiatric patients have recently been introduced. One of the means used to screen for and treat somatic disease in psychiatric patients is highly qualified referral for somatic specialist assessment. The aim of this study was to assess the quality of referral of psychiatric patients to specialists in internal medicine. A total of 110 consecutive referrals were collected from August to November in 2012 and 2013. Regional guidelines define the requirement for the satisfactory referral scheme and using these guidelines as a reference  each referral was rated based on indexation and an overall assessment. A report about the 2012 results was presented to the hospital management. The management of the hospital was not informed about the 2013 replication of the study. Half of the topics assessed were inadequately completed. Information about somatic co-morbidity was missing in 76% of the referrals. Description of relevant tests and physical examinations was missing in 53%. By overall assessment  40% of the referrals were rated as being insufficient. The resident physicians stand out by producing the most informative referrals. The 2013 results improved compared with 2012. We call for improvement in the quality of the referrals among psychiatric in-patients to somatic specialists. We propose an expansion of the use of standardised schemes and a strengthening of the skills needed to write a good referral.
Pharmacoepidemiology,Pharmacology,,Identification of Associations Between Prescribed Medications and Cancer: A Nationwide Screening Study. We present a systematic screening for identifying associations between prescribed drugs and cancer risk using the high quality Danish nationwide health registries. We identified all patients (cases) with incident cancer in Denmark during 2000-2012 (n=278 485) and matched each case to 10 controls. Complete prescription histories since 1995 were extracted. Applying a two-phased case-control approach  we first identified drug classes or single drugs associated with an increased or decreased risk of 99 different cancer types  and further evaluated potential associations by examining specificity and dose-response patterns. 22 125 drug-cancer pairs underwent evaluation in the first phase. Of 4561 initial signals (i.e.  drug-cancer associations)  3541 (78%) failed to meet requirements for dose-response patterns and specificity  leaving 1020 eligible signals. Of these  510 signals involved the use of single drugs  and 33% (166 signals) and 67% (344 signals) suggested a reduced or an increased cancer risk  respectively. While a large proportion of the signals were attributable to the underlying conditions being treated  our algorithm successfully identified well-established associations  as well as several new signals that deserve further investigation. Our results provide the basis for future targeted studies of single associations to capture novel carcinogenic or chemopreventive effects of prescription drugs.
Pharmacoepidemiology,,,Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and risk of endometrial cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use has been linked to a reduction in the risk of several cancer types. For endometrial cancer  however  results have been inconsistent. To summarize the available evidence on the risk of endometrial cancer associated with use of aspirin or non-aspirin (NA-) NSAIDs  we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies. We conducted a bibliographic database search in PubMed  Embase and Cochrane Library. Relative risk estimates were extracted from eligible case-control and cohort studies and pooled using a random effects model. Six case-control and seven cohort studies were found eligible for our meta-analysis. We observed risk reductions in endometrial cancer associated with regular use of aspirin (case-control: 11%  cohort: 8%) and NA-NSAIDs (case-control: 9%  cohort: 6%)  compared to non-use. However  the pooled risk ratios were not statistically significant. Higher risk reductions were seen with high frequency of notably aspirin use (case-control: 37%  cohort: 20%). The inverse association between regular aspirin use and endometrial cancer risk was strongest among women with a body mass index above 30 (case-control: 44%  cohort: 20%). Regular use of aspirin or NA-NSAIDs was associated with a marginally reduced risk of endometrial cancer. Larger risk reductions were linked with high frequency of NSAID use and high BMI.
Pharmacoepidemiology,,,Long-term Use of Statins and Risk of Renal Cell Carcinoma: A Population-based Case-Control Study. Use of statins has been suggested to protect against renal cell carcinoma (RCC); however  studies have typically been underpowered  and the results are conflicting. To determine whether the use of statins is associated with a reduced risk of RCC using high-quality registry data. We conducted a nationwide case-control study based on all histologically verified cases of RCC in Denmark between 2002 and 2012 (n=4606) matched 1:10 to cancer-free controls. Data on drug use  comorbidity  and educational level were obtained from Danish nationwide prescription  patient  and demographic registries. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for RCC associated with long-term use (≥5 yr) of statins were estimated using conditional logistic regression  adjusting for potential confounders. The adjusted OR for RCC associated with long-term use of statins was 1.06 (95% CI  0.91-1.23). Analyses stratified by duration of statin use  type of statin  and patient characteristics all yielded ORs close to unity  except for a slightly increased OR for RCC associated with long-term statin use among women (OR: 1.25; 95% CI  0.96-1.62). The main limitation of our study was lack of information on lifestyle factors  notably obesity  which may have biased the risk estimates upward. Our study does not support an important chemopreventive effect of long-term statin use against RCC. The marginally increased and statistically insignificant risk estimates can readily be interpreted as a null finding  considering the lack of control for obesity and other lifestyle risk factors. Previous studies have shown that the use of cholesterol-lowering drugs (statins) may protect against renal cancer. In a large study including all Danish renal cancers during an 11-yr period  we found no evidence of such an effect.
Medical Laboratory Science,,,[Patient safety in a health technology assessment perspective]. The Danish Act of Patient Safety entered into force in 2004. This paper studies the consequences of the Act for the health care system and its users by a literature evaluation and an interview study with key persons. Despite the substantial resources spent on the reporting system  no evidence is found that the Act has an improved effect on patient safety. One of the biggest barriers for reporting adverse events is a lack of follow-up and feedback. Research into the patient's role on preventing adverse events is limited. The possibilities created by the Act should be utilized to their full potential.
Family Practice,,,Patients' written life stories: a gateway for understanding. To explore how statements drawn from patients' written life stories can help general practitioners understand their patients' maladaptive thought patterns and their negative schemata. Qualitative study of written life stories. General practice in Copenhagen  Denmark. A total of 22 consecutive patients aged 23-49 years  who were invited by their GP to participate in cognitive therapy owing to depressive or anxiety-related disorders  including unexplained bodily symptoms. Beck's information-processing model of anxiety. Analysis of the written life stories disclosed aspects of negative expectations of life  the self  or the values and capabilities of others or of the patient him- or herself. Three main beliefs were identified: (1) the world is evil  (2) only the perfect is of value  and (3) emotions are dangerous. The patients describe events and experiences in negative terms that others might have interpreted as neutral or positive. For some this translated into a sort of all-or-nothing kind of thinking. Anger and other strong feelings were forbidden. Responsibility for the life of others was a dominant feature. Written life stories reveal knowledge of the patient's dysfunctional thought patterns. This may be a useful shortcut in therapy.
Medical Illustration,,,[Stapled anopexy for prolapsed hemorrhoids--a new operation]. Haemorrhoidectomy is associated with pain and open wounds. A new closed technique uses an intraluminal stapler to replace the prolapsed haemorrhoidal tissue to a normal anatomical position (anopexy) and to interrupt the vessels. We report our results  including the learning curve. Forty patients with grade 4 haemorrhoids underwent operation  26 women  median age 47 years (33-86)  and 14 men  median age 53 years (34-75). Outcome parameters were hospital stay  pain score  surgical anatomy score before and after the operation  and complications  symptom-control and patient satisfaction. Eleven patients left hospital on the day of operation  19 the day after. The median pain score was 3 (2-10) for the first four days and 1 on day 7 (0-4). The postoperative surgical anatomy score was 1 (normal anus) in 24 patients  2 in nine patients  which was not different significantly at follow up (p > 0.05). Postoperative bleeding required haemostasis in two patients. One patient had a stenosis temporarily  and two patients had persistent pain and faecal urgency  which disappeared. No sphincter lesions occurred. Control of symptoms and satisfaction were excellent in 20 patients  good in 11  and satisfactory in five. Stapled anopexy restored surgical anatomy towards normal  with moderate pain and few complications. Control of symptoms and patient-satisfaction was high. The procedure is a new option in the treatment of severe haemorrhoids rather than an alternative to open haemorrhoidectomy.
Epidemiology,Pathology,,Sudden cardiac death and coronary disease in the young: A nationwide cohort study in Denmark. Sudden cardiac death caused by coronary artery disease (CAD-SCD) is the most frequent cause of SCD in persons <50years. The aim of this study was to examine differences in clinical characteristics and autopsy findings of the heart among 18-35 and 36-49year old CAD-SCD cases. We have previously identified all sudden cardiac deaths in Denmark through review of death certificates and autopsy reports including all deaths between 2000 and 2006 in individuals aged 18-35years and all deaths between 2007 and 2009 in individuals aged 18-49years. In this study we included the 197 autopsied CAD-SCD cases. Full autopsy report and medical records from general practitioners and hospitals were obtained. There was a male predominance (n=151  76%) and the median age was 42years. In witnessed cases  51% had a shockable rhythm and 9 cases returned to spontaneous circulation briefly  CAD-SCD victims aged 36-49years had more severe atherosclerosis in all coronary arteries  more multi-vessel disease (29% vs. 15%  p=0.049) and less commonly (38% vs. 54%  p=0.039) acute coronary occlusion than victims <36years. Sixty-eight percent(n=133) of CAD-SCD victims had cardiac symptoms prior to death. This nationwide study found several differences in the pathologic lesions of the heart in victims aged 18-35 and 36-49years  which might be associated with different disease progression leading to death in these age groups. We also report a high frequency of cardiac symptoms prior to death in young CAD-SCD cases  which may enable clinicians to prevent these tragic deaths.
Epidemiology,,,Gender differences in sudden cardiac death in the young-a nationwide study. Hitherto  sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the young has been described with no distinction between genders. SCD occurs more often in men (SCDm) than women (SCDw)  but this disparity is not understood and has not been investigated systematically in a nationwide setting. Our objective was to report gender differences in SCD in the young in a nationwide (Denmark) setting. All deaths in persons aged 1-35 years nationwide in Denmark between 2000 and 2009 were included. Death certificates and autopsy reports were obtained. The extensive health care registries in Denmark were used to investigate any known disease prior to death. SCDw were compared to SCDm. During the 10-year study period there were a total of 8756 deaths in 23.7 million person-years. In total  635 deaths were SCD. SCDw constituted 205 deaths (32%). Women had a higher proportion of witnessed deaths (51 vs. 41%  p = 0.02) and died less often in a public place (16 vs. 26%  p = 0.01). Age at death  ratios of autopsies and sudden unexplained deaths  and comorbidities  did not differ. Causes of SCD were largely comparable between genders. The incidence rate of SCDw was half of that of SCDm (1.8 vs. 3.6 per 100 000 person-years  incidence rate ratio 2.0 (95% CI 1.7-2.4)  p < 0.01). Incidence rate ratio of SCDm vs SCDw is 2. Young SCDw and SCDm are equally investigated  have comparable comorbidity  and causes of SCD. SCD due to potentially inherited cardiac diseases is less often in young women and could reflect a protection of female gender.
Precision Medicine,Telemedicine,,Co-production of Health enabled by next generation personal health systems. This paper describes the theoretical principles for the establishment of a parallel and complementary modality of healthcare delivery - named Coproduction of Health (CpH). This service-model activates digital data  information  and knowledge about health  healthy choices  and the individuals' health-state and computes through personalized models context-aware communication and advice. "Lightweight technologies" (smartphones  tablets  application stores) would serve as the technology close to the end-users (citizens  patients  clients  customers)  connecting them with "big data" in conventionally and non-conventionally organized data repositories. The CpH modality aims at providing synergies between professional healthcare  selfcare  informal care and provides data-fusion from several sources such as health characteristics of consumer goods  from sensors  actuators  and health related data-repositories  and turns this into "health added value" for the individual. A theoretical business model respecting healthcare values  ethics  and legal foundation is also sketched out.
Internal Medicine,,,A socio-technical study of an ubiquitous CPOE-system in local use. A socio-technical approach was used to study the qualitative effects of deploying a medication-CPOE (Computer-based Provider Order Entry System) at two internal medical wards on a hospital in Denmark. Our results show spatial and temporal transformations of core acts in medication work  transformation in competencies  and less time spent at the bedside for nurses and doctors  as a system--constructed for ubiquitous drug-order entries and handling--was implemented for local use. This study throws light on problems of patient continuity  patient-related and IT-system-related error-handling and time spend on core activities--when ubiquitous IT is used locally in a real physical setting with specific traditions of doing medication acts. The paper argues for the project organization to support the local renegotiation of time and place of programs of (work-)action and of collaboration with 'ubiquitous' CPOE-systems  as well as set up feed-back for maturation of software for future clinical use.
Radiology  Interventional,,,[Interventional radiology in Norwegian hospitals]. In recent years  interventional radiology has gained in importance in patient treatment. In order to assess the impact of this trend  the executive committee of the Norwegian Society for Interventional Radiology made a registration of all interventional procedures in Norwegian hospitals in the year 2000. Data were collected by a questionnaire sent to all Norwegian hospitals. Coronary interventions were not included. Forty-four out of 58 departments returned the questionnaire; 33 stated that they performed interventional procedures. A total of 18 135 procedures were performed in Norway in 2000; we present data on the distribution of types of procedures on different categories of hospitals. A large number of interventional radiological procedures were performed in Norwegian hospitals in the year 2000  types of intervention that are considered very important in patient management in small hospitals  too.
Environmental Health,,,Report: examples of capacity building cooperation. Odense Waste Management Company Ltd. (OWMC) covers the municipality of Odense having around 185 000 inhabitants. It is a not-for-profit company  in which all services are paid for by the users. OWMC is increasingly participating in international development activities  particularly within training and operational support. This is mainly driven by the staff  who think it is important  interesting  challenging and fun to contribute their know-how elsewhere. The main approach applied  when training and practice is undertaken for OWMC's own staff as well as for international cooperation partners  is to keep things simple and easily understandable  even if there may sometimes be rather complex processes and activities involved. So far  OWMC has in 2003-2005 participated in a project for the municipalities of Koszalin and Slupsk in Northern Poland  and in 2005-2007 in a project for the newly established solid waste management departments of Beni Suef and El Fashn cities in Egypt. Would it be possible to create a future waste management sector with more know-how sharing mechanisms in place  and might the establishment of a capacity building working group or networking forum  for example  within the framework of ISWA be an important step forward in this context? Why not just start now?
Anesthesiology,,,Danish Guidelines 2015 for percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy in the intensive care unit. Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy is a common procedure in intensive care. This updated Danish national guideline describes indications  contraindications and complications  and gives recommendations for timing  anaesthesia  and technique  use of fibre bronchoscopy and ultrasound guidance  as well as decannulation strategy  training  and education.
Anesthesiology,,,Guidelines for Percutaneous Dilatational Tracheostomy (PDT) from the Danish Society of Intensive Care Medicine (DSIT) and the Danish Society of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (DASAIM). Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy is a common procedure in intensive care. This guideline from the Danish Society of Intensive Care Medicine (DSIT) and the Danish Society of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (DASAIM) describes indications and contraindications  timing  complications compared to surgical tracheostomy  anaesthesia and technique  decannulation strategy  as well as training and education.
Dietetics,,,Effect of fruit restriction on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes--a randomized trial. Medical nutrition therapy is recognized as an important treatment option in type 2 diabetes. Most guidelines recommend eating a diet with a high intake of fiber-rich food including fruit. This is based on the many positive effects of fruit on human health. However some health professionals have concerns that fruit intake has a negative impact on glycemic control and therefore recommend restricting the fruit intake. We found no studies addressing this important clinical question. The objective was to investigate whether an advice to reduce the intake of fruit to patients with type 2 diabetes affects HbA1c  bodyweight  waist circumference and fruit intake. This was an open randomized controlled trial with two parallel groups. The primary outcome was a change in HbA1c during 12 weeks of intervention. Participants were randomized to one of two interventions; medical nutrition therapy + advice to consume at least two pieces of fruit a day (high-fruit) or medical nutrition therapy + advice to consume no more than two pieces of fruit a day (low-fruit). All participants had two consultations with a registered dietitian. Fruit intake was self-reported using 3-day fruit records and dietary recalls. All assessments were made by the "intention to treat" principle. The study population consisted of 63 men and women with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. All patients completed the trial. The high-fruit group increased fruit intake with 125 grams (CI 95%; 78 to 172) and the low-fruit group reduced intake with 51 grams (CI 95%; -18 to -83). HbA1c decreased in both groups with no difference between the groups (diff.: 0.19%  CI 95%; -0.23 to 0.62). Both groups reduced body weight and waist circumference  however there was no difference between the groups. A recommendation to reduce fruit intake as part of standard medical nutrition therapy in overweight patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes resulted in eating less fruit. It had however no effect on HbA1c  weight loss or waist circumference. We recommend that the intake of fruit should not be restricted in patients with type 2 diabetes. http://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Identifier: NCT01010594.
Pediatrics,,,Clinical features of functional somatic symptoms in children and referral patterns to child and adolescent mental health services. Functional somatic symptoms (FSS) are common in paediatric patients who are referred to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS)  but little is known about current referral practices. The aim of this study was to systematically investigate clinical features of paediatric inpatients with FSS referred to CAMHS and to describe why paediatricians referred them. The study population comprised 60 children with FSS admitted to a large Danish paediatric department during 2012. We compared medical record data on the clinical characteristics and paediatric management of 16 children who had been referred and 44 children who had not. Most paediatric records lacked information on psychosocial factors and symptoms. Referred children were significantly more multisymptomatic of FSS (p < 0.01) than the controls  had longer symptom duration  underwent more clinical investigations  had longer paediatric admissions of at least two weeks and received more treatment elements before referral. The most frequently stated referral reason was inadequate treatment response. Paediatric inpatients with more severe FSS were more likely to be referred to CAMHS  but referral reasons were generally vague and psychosocial information was frequently missing. Clinical guidelines are needed to improve and systematise mental health referrals for children with FSS.
Gastroenterology,Internal Medicine,Nutritional Sciences,Clinical nutrition in medical gastroenterology: room for improvement. Undernutrition is a problem in hospitals  with lack of nutritional routines. Recently  guidelines concerning the nutritional care process were developed from ESPEN. This study was conducted to assess the present status of nutritional routines among doctors and nurses in internal medicine (IM) and medical gastroenterology (MG)  in comparison with the ESPEN guidelines. A questionnaire-based investigation among doctors and nurses working in departments of internal medicine and gastroenterology in Scandinavia  based on further analysis of previous data. Overall  4512 (1753 doctors  2759 nurses) answered the questionnaire  of which 1155 were from internal medicine and 193 from gastroenterology. A similar  non-significant  discrepancy in attitudes and nutritional routines was noted in gastroenterologists and internists. Concerning basic nutritional education  46% in MG and 48% in IM considered it insufficient (not significant). When comparing all doctors with all nurses  60% and 39% respectively considered their basic nutritional education insufficient (p<0.001). Concerning prescription of parenteral nutrition  65% of the internists and 92% of the gastroenterologists had sufficient knowledge (p<0.001)  while technical skill did not differ (not significant). Lack of interest was more pronounced in the internists than in the gastroenterologists  42% vs. 32% (p<0.05)  and more pronounced in doctors when comparing all doctors with all nurses (47 vs. 36%  p<0.001). A discrepancy between clinical practice and attitudes towards nutrition is evident in both gastroenterology and internal medicine. Although gastroenterologists are more interested  there is room for improvement in both groups. This is true for doctors as well as nurses  even though nurses seem to be more interested and better trained than doctors.
Nutritional Sciences,,,Insufficient nutritional knowledge among health care workers? Though a great interest and willingness to nutrition therapy  there is an insufficient practice compared to the proposed ESPEN guidelines for nutrition therapy. The aim of this questionnaire was to study doctors and nurses' self-reported knowledge in nutritional practice  with focus on ESPEN's guidelines in nutritional screening  assessment and treatment. A questionnaire about different aspects of nutritional practice was answered by 4512 doctors and nurses in Denmark  Sweden and Norway. The most common cause for insufficient nutritional practice was lack of nutritional knowledge. Twenty-five percent found it difficult to identify patient in need of nutritional therapy  39% lacked techniques for identifying malnourished patients  and 53% found it difficult to calculate the patients' energy requirement and 66% lacked national guidelines for clinical nutrition. Twenty-eight percent answered that insufficient nutrition practice could lead to complications and prolonged hospital stay. Those that answered that their nutritional knowledge was good had also a better nutritional practice. The self-reported nutritional knowledge was inadequate among Scandinavian doctors and nurses. Increased nutritional knowledge seems to improve the nutritional practice. A combination of an integrated nutrition curriculum during the education  together with post-graduated education for both physicians and nurses should be established.
Epidemiology,,,Association between enrolment in a heart failure quality registry and subsequent mortality-a nationwide cohort study. Heart failure (HF) quality registries report quality of care but it is unknown whether they improve outcomes. The aims were to assess predictors of enrolment in a HF registry  test the hypothesis that enrolment in a HF registry is associated with reduced mortality  and assess potential explanatory factors for this reduction in mortality  if present. We conducted a nationwide prospective cohort study of patients with new-onset HF registered in the Swedish National Patient Registry (NPR  a mandatory registry of ICD-code diagnoses) with or without concurrent registration in the Swedish Heart Failure Registry (SwedeHF  a voluntary quality reporting registry) 2006-2013. The association between demographics  co-morbidities and medications  and enrolment in the SwedeHF  was assessed using multivariable logistic regression. The association between enrolment in the SwedeHF and all-cause mortality was assessed using multivariable Cox regression  with adjustment for demographics  co-morbidities and medications. A total of 231 437 patients were included  of which 21 888 (9.5%) were in the SwedeHF [age (mean ± standard deviation) 74 ± 13 years; 41% women; 68% inpatients] and 209 549 (90.5%) were not (age 78 ± 12 years  50% women; 79% inpatients). Selected variables independently associated with enrolment in the SwedeHF were male sex  younger age  higher education  absent co-morbidities and co-morbidity-related medications  and use of HF and cardiovascular medications. Over a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 874 (247-1667) days  there were 13.0 vs. 20.8 deaths per 100 patient-years (P < 0.001). The hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for death for the SwedeHF yes vs. no was 0.65 (0.63-0.66) crude  and increased to 0.80 (0.78-0.81) after adding demographics  to 0.82 (0.80-0.84) after adding co-morbidities and co-morbidity-related medications  to 0.95 (0.93-0.97) after adding cardiovascular medications  and to 1.04 (1.02-1.07) after adding HF-specific medications. Heart failure patients of male sex  younger age  and higher education were more likely to be enrolled in a HF quality registry. Enrolment was associated with reduced all-cause mortality that was explained by demographic differences and better utilization of cardiovascular and HF medications.
Epidemiology,,,Association between demographic  organizational  clinical  and socio-economic characteristics and underutilization of cardiac resynchronization therapy: results from the Swedish Heart Failure Registry. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) improves outcomes in heart failure (HF) but may be underutilized. The reasons are unknown. We linked the Swedish Heart Failure Registry to national registries with ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision) co-morbidity diagnoses and demographic and socio-economic data. In patients with EF ≤39% and NYHA II-IV  we assessed prevalence of CRT indication and CRT use. In those with CRT indication  we assessed the association between 37 potential baseline covariates and CRT non-use using multivariable generalized estimating equation (GEE) models. Of 12 807 patients (mean age 71 ± 12 years  28% female)  841 (7%) had CRT  3094 (24%) had an indication for but non-use of CRT  and 8872 (69%) had no indication. Important variables independently associated with CRT non-use were: HF duration <6 months [risk ratio (RR) 1.21  95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17-1.24]; non-cardiology planned follow-up (RR 1.14  95% CI 1.09-1.18); age >75 years (RR 1.13  95% CI 1.09-1.18); non-cardiology care at baseline (RR 1.10  95% CI 1.07-1.14); small-town non-university centre (RR 1.08  95% CI 1.05-1.12); female sex (RR 1.07 95% CI 1.03-1.10) (all P < 0.05); as was absence of AF  living alone; psychiatric diagnosis; smoking; and non-use of HF drugs. Education  income  cancer  or HF characteristics were not independently associated with CRT non-use. In this population-wide HF registry  CRT was underutilized. Non-use was associated mostly with demographic and organizational  but not clinical or socio-economic factors. This calls for programmes to raise awareness of CRT indications and improve access and referrals to cardiology specialists.
General Practice,,,Effect of early multifactorial therapy compared with routine care on microvascular outcomes at 5 years in people with screen-detected diabetes: a randomized controlled trial: the ADDITION-Europe Study. To determine the benefit of multifactorial treatment on microvascular complications among people with type 2 diabetes detected by screening. This study was a multicenter cluster randomized controlled trial in primary care with randomization at the practice level. In four centers in Denmark; Cambridge  U.K.; the Netherlands; and Leicester  U.K.  343 general practices participated in the trial. Eligible for follow-up were 2 861 of the 3 057 people with diabetes detected by screening included in the original trial. Biomedical data on nephropathy were collected in 2 710 (94.7%) participants  retinal photos in 2 190 (76.6%)  and questionnaire data on peripheral neuropathy in 2 312 (80.9%). The prespecified microvascular end points were analyzed by intention to treat. Results from the four centers were pooled using fixed-effects meta-analysis. Five years after diagnosis  any kind of albuminuria was present in 22.7% of participants in the intensive treatment (IT) group and in 24.4% in the routine care (RC) group (odds ratio 0.87 [95% CI 0.72-1.07]). Retinopathy was present in 10.2% of the IT group and 12.1% of the RC group (0.84 [0.64-1.10])  and severe retinopathy was present in one patient in the IT group and seven in the RC group. Neuropathy was present in 4.9% and 5.9% (0.95 [0.68-1.34])  respectively. Estimated glomerular filtration rate increased between baseline and follow-up in both groups (4.31 and 6.44 mL/min  respectively). Compared with RC  an intervention to promote target-driven  intensive management of patients with type 2 diabetes detected by screening was not associated with significant reductions in the frequency of microvascular events at 5 years.
General Practice,,,Socioeconomic position and cardiovascular risk factors among people with screen-detected Type 2 DM: six-year follow-up of the ADDITION-Denmark trial. To examine whether socioeconomic position (SEP) was associated with change in cardiovascular risk factors and meeting treatment targets for cardiovascular risk factors among individuals with screen-detected Type 2 DM at six-year follow-up. The study population was 1533 people with Type 2 DM identified from at stepwise diabetes screening programme in general practice during 2001-2006 in the ADDITION-Denmark study. The ADDITION-study was performed as a randomised trial but the two randomisation groups were analysed as one cohort in this study. Cardiovascular risk factors were measured at baseline and repeated at follow-up (mean: 5.9 [1.4] years). Information on SEP  redeemed antihypertensive and lipid-lowering treatment were obtained from Danish registers. Multivariate analyses were performed to estimate change in cardiovascular risk factors and difference in meeting treatment targets. The change in HbA1c  cholesterol  blood pressure and BMI were virtually the same across educational level  income level  occupational status or cohabiting status. Overall  the ability to meet treatment targets for HbA1c  cholesterol and blood pressure was not modified by SEP-group. A higher proportion of people with lower educational level or lower income level in the intensive care redeemed anti-hypertensive treatment compared to people with higher educational or income levels. Screen-detection and early treatment onset did not introduce socioeconomic inequality in metabolic control in people with screen-detected Type 2 DM at six-year follow-up.
Stroke Rehabilitation,,,Stroke rehabilitation at home before and after discharge reduced disability and improved quality of life: a randomised controlled trial. To evaluate if home-based rehabilitation of inpatients improved outcome compared to standard care. Interventional  randomised  safety/efficacy open-label trial. University hospital stroke unit in collaboration with three municipalities. Seventy-one eligible stroke patients (41 women) with focal neurological deficits hospitalised in a stroke unit for more than three days and in need of rehabilitation. Thirty-eight patients were randomised to home-based rehabilitation during hospitalization and for up to four weeks after discharge to replace part of usual treatment and rehabilitation services. Thirty-three control patients received treatment and rehabilitation following usual guidelines for the treatment of stroke patients. Ninety days post-stroke the modified Rankin Scale score was the primary endpoint. Other outcome measures were the modified Barthel-100 Index  Motor Assessment Scale  CT-50 Cognitive Test  EuroQol-5D  Body Mass Index and treatment-associated economy. Thirty-one intervention and 30 control patients completed the study. Patients in the intervention group achieved better modified Rankin Scale score (Intervention median = 2  IQR = 2-3; Control median = 3  IQR = 2-4; P=0.04). EuroQol-5D quality of life median scores were improved in intervention patients (Intervention median = 0.77  IQR = 0.66-0.79; Control median = 0.66  IQR = 0.56 - 0.72; P=0.03). The total amount of home-based training in minutes highly correlated with mRS  Barthel  Motor Assessment Scale and EuroQol-5D™ scores (P-values ranging from P<0.00001 to P=0.01). Economical estimations of intervention costs were lower than total costs of standard treatment. Early home-based rehabilitation reduced disability and increased quality of life. Compared to standard care  home-based stroke rehabilitation was more cost-effective.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Evidence-based medicine - an appropriate tool for evidence-based health policy? A case study from Norway. Evidence-based policy (EBP)  a concept modelled on the principles of evidence-based medicine (EBM)  is widely used in different areas of policymaking. Systematic reviews (SRs) with meta-analyses gradually became the methods of choice for synthesizing research evidence about interventions and judgements about quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. Critics have argued that the relation between research evidence and service policies is weak  and that the notion of EBP rests on a misunderstanding of policy processes. Having explored EBM standards and knowledge requirements for health policy decision-making  we present an empirical point of departure for discussing the relationship between EBM and EBP. In a case study exploring the Norwegian Knowledge Centre for the Health Services (NOKC)  an independent government unit  we first searched for information about the background and development of the NOKC to establish a research context. We then identified  selected and organized official NOKC publications as an empirical sample of typical top-of-the-line knowledge delivery adhering to EBM standards. Finally  we explored conclusions in this type of publication  specifically addressing their potential as policy decision tools. From a total sample of 151 SRs published by the NOKC in the period 2004-2013  a purposive subsample from 2012 (14 publications) advised major caution about their conclusions because of the quality or relevance of the underlying documentation. Although the case study did not include a systematic investigation of uptake and policy consequences  SRs were found to be inappropriate as universal tools for health policy decision-making. The case study demonstrates that EBM is not necessarily suited to knowledge provision for every kind of policy decision-making. Our analysis raises the question of whether the evidence-based movement  represented here by an independent government organization  undertakes too broad a range of commissions using strategies that seem too confined. Policymaking in healthcare should be based on relevant and transparent knowledge  taking due account of the context of the intervention. However  we do not share the belief that the complex and messy nature of policy processes in general is compatible with the standards of EBM.
Midwifery,,,Neither father nor biological mother. A qualitative study about lesbian co-mothers' maternity care experiences. To explore lesbian co-mothers' maternity care experiences and their implications for the caring encounter. A qualitative interview study with data from a convenience sample of eleven Norwegian comothers was conducted. Systematic text condensation was used for data analysis. Analysis showed that ordinary tokens of recognition created feelings of being included  while lesbian self-confidence played a major role in awkward encounters. Being neither father nor biological mother sometimes challenged parental identity. Being women helped co-mothers understand what their partners went through but they had to find other ways of mothering than if they had given birth themselves. Co-mothers addressed themselves with different terms and perceived some concepts as unnatural or excluding. Parental identity was defined by their relationship to baby  and the term "co-mother" was perceived as a bureaucratic concept. For lesbian co-mothers  being recognized in maternity care implies that they are valued for the qualities that separate them from other user groups on a personal level. On a societal level  being recognized is related to acknowledgement of inventive ways of doing family. Everyday signs of recognition may prevent moral violation  and by paying particular attention to use of language  staff can help co-mothers feel acknowledged.
General Practice,,,Theory and interpretation in qualitative studies from general practice: Why and how? In this article  I want to promote theoretical awareness and commitment among qualitative researchers in general practice and suggest adequate and feasible theoretical approaches. I discuss different theoretical aspects of qualitative research and present the basic foundations of the interpretative paradigm. Associations between paradigms  philosophies  methodologies and methods are examined and different strategies for theoretical commitment presented. Finally  I discuss the impact of theory for interpretation and the development of general practice knowledge. A scientific theory is a consistent and soundly based set of assumptions about a specific aspect of the world  predicting or explaining a phenomenon. Qualitative research is situated in an interpretative paradigm where notions about particular human experiences in context are recognized from different subject positions. Basic theoretical features from the philosophy of science explain why and how this is different from positivism. Reflexivity  including theoretical awareness and consistency  demonstrates interpretative assumptions  accounting for situated knowledge. Different types of theoretical commitment in qualitative analysis are presented  emphasizing substantive theories to sharpen the interpretative focus. Such approaches are clearly within reach for a general practice researcher contributing to clinical practice by doing more than summarizing what the participants talked about  without trying to become a philosopher. Qualitative studies from general practice deserve stronger theoretical awareness and commitment than what is currently established. Persistent attention to and respect for the distinctive domain of knowledge and practice where the research deliveries are targeted is necessary to choose adequate theoretical endeavours.
Precision Medicine,,,The impact of gender on the long-term morbidity and mortality of patients with type 2 diabetes receiving structured personal care: a 13 year follow-up study. The aim of this study was to assess gender differences in mortality and morbidity during 13 follow-up years after 6 years of structured personal care in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the Diabetes Care in General Practice (DCGP) multicentre  cluster-randomised  controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov registration no. NCT01074762)  1 381 patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes were randomised to receive 6 years of either structured personal care or routine care. The intervention included regular follow-up  individualised goal setting and continuing medical education of general practitioners participating in the intervention. Patients were re-examined at the end of intervention. This observational analysis followed 970 patients for 13 years thereafter using national registries. Outcomes were all-cause mortality  incidence of diabetes-related death  any diabetes-related endpoint  myocardial infarction  stroke  peripheral vascular disease and microvascular disease. In women  but not men  a lower HR for structured personal care vs routine care emerged for any diabetes-related endpoint (0.65  p = 0.004  adjusted; 73.4 vs 107.7 events per 1 000 patient-years)  diabetes-related death (0.70  p = 0.031; 34.6 vs 45.7)  all-cause mortality (0.74  p = 0.028; 55.5 vs 68.5) and stroke (0.59  p = 0.038; 15.6 vs 28.9). This effect was different between men and women for diabetes-related death (interaction p = 0.015) and all-cause mortality (interaction p = 0.005). Compared with routine care  structured personal diabetes care reduced all-cause mortality and diabetes-related death in women but not in men. This gender difference was also observed for any diabetes-related outcome and stroke but was not statistically significant after extensive multivariate adjustment. These observational results from a post hoc analysis of a randomised controlled trial cannot be explained by intermediate outcomes like HbA1c alone  but involves complex social and cultural issues of gender. There is a need to rethink treatment schemes for both men and women to gain benefit from intensified treatment efforts.
Family Practice,,,GPs' negotiation strategies regarding sick leave for subjective health complaints. To explore general practitioners' (GPs') specific negotiation strategies regarding sick-leave issues with patients suffering from subjective health complaints. Focus-group study. Nine focus-group interviews in three cities in different regions of Norway. 48 GPs (31 men  17 women; age 32-65)  participating in a course dealing with diagnostic practice and assessment of sickness certificates related to patients with subjective health complaints. The GPs identified some specific strategies that they claimed to apply when dealing with the question of sick leave for patients with subjective health complaints. The first step would be to build an alliance with the patient by complying with the wish for sick leave  and at the same time searching for information to acquire the patient's perspective. This position would become the basis for the main goal: motivating the patient for a rapid return to work by pointing out the positive effects of staying at work  making legal and moral arguments  and warning against long-term sick leave. Additional solutions might also be applied  such as involving other stakeholders in this process to provide alternatives to sick leave. GPs seem to have a conscious approach to negotiations of sickness certification  as they report applying specific strategies to limit the duration of sick leave due to subjective health complaints. This give-and-take way of handling sick-leave negotiations has been suggested by others to enhance return to work  and should be further encouraged. However  specific effectiveness of this strategy is yet to be proven  and further investigation into the actual dealings between doctor and patients in these complex encounters is needed.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,YouTube as a source of quitting smoking information. To conduct analyses to determine the extent to which YouTube videos posted specific to smoking cessation were actually about quitting smoking and if so  whether or not they portrayed evidence-based practices (EBPs). In August 2008  researchers identified YouTube videos by search strategies  'relevance' and 'view count' using the following three search terms: 'stop smoking'  'quit smoking' and 'smoking cessation (n=296 for full sample and n=191 for unique videos). Overall  almost 60% of videos contained a message about quitting smoking. Differences were found across search terms for videos about quitting smoking  with 'stop smoking' yielding the highest percentage (80.8%) of videos about quitting smoking. Almost half of the videos (48.9%) contained EBPs for cessation strategies; however  a significant portion contained either non--EBPs (28.4%) or both EBPs and non-EBPs (22.7%). The number of views per an individual video across the six categories ranged from a low of 8 in the 'relevance' strategy and 'smoking cessation' search term to a high of 1 247 540 in the 'view count' strategy and 'stop smoking' search term. Of the top three most viewed videos by strategy and search term  66.7% included a specific mention of quitting smoking and  of these  the majority included EBPs. Results highlight the need to develop and upload videos containing EBPs both to increase the overall proportion of EBP videos in all categories  particularly in 'quit smoking' and 'stop smoking.' Research is needed to study whether YouTube videos influence knowledge  attitudes and behaviours regarding quitting smoking.
Urology,,,EAU guidelines on the treatment and follow-up of non-neurogenic male lower urinary tract symptoms including benign prostatic obstruction. To present a summary of the 2013 version of the European Association of Urology guidelines on the treatment and follow-up of male lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). We conducted a literature search in computer databases for relevant articles published between 1966 and 31 October 2012. The Oxford classification system (2001) was used to determine the level of evidence for each article and to assign the grade of recommendation for each treatment modality. Men with mild symptoms are suitable for watchful waiting. All men with bothersome LUTS should be offered lifestyle advice prior to or concurrent with any treatment. Men with bothersome moderate-to-severe LUTS quickly benefit from α1-blockers. Men with enlarged prostates  especially those >40ml  profit from 5α-reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) that slowly reduce LUTS and the probability of urinary retention or the need for surgery. Antimuscarinics might be considered for patients who have predominant bladder storage symptoms. The phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor tadalafil can quickly reduce LUTS to a similar extent as α1-blockers  and it also improves erectile dysfunction. Desmopressin can be used in men with nocturia due to nocturnal polyuria. Treatment with an α1-blocker and 5-ARI (in men with enlarged prostates) or antimuscarinics (with persistent storage symptoms) combines the positive effects of either drug class to achieve greater efficacy. Prostate surgery is indicated in men with absolute indications or drug treatment-resistant LUTS due to benign prostatic obstruction. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is the current standard operation for men with prostates 30-80ml  whereas open surgery or transurethral holmium laser enucleation is appropriate for men with prostates >80ml. Alternatives for monopolar TURP include bipolar TURP and transurethral incision of the prostate (for glands <30ml) and laser treatments. Transurethral microwave therapy and transurethral needle ablation are effective minimally invasive treatments with higher retreatment rates compared with TURP. Prostate stents are an alternative to catheterisation for men unfit for surgery. Ethanol or botulinum toxin injections into the prostate are still experimental. These symptom-oriented guidelines provide practical guidance for the management of men experiencing LUTS. The full version is available online (www.uroweb.org/gls/pdf/12_Male_LUTS.pdf).
Global Health,,,Global concepts of bladder pain syndrome (interstitial cystitis). Bladder pain syndrome (BPS)  commonly referred to as "interstitial cystitis"  is no longer considered a rare disorder. It may affect up to 2.7% of the adult female population (Ueda et al. in Int J Urol 10:1-70  2003) with up to 20% of cases occurring in men. The last two decades have seen a worldwide effort to try to standardize its nomenclature  definition  diagnosis  and treatment algorithm. The literature has been reviewed. In this article  we will detail current terminology  diagnostic approaches and treatment. Standard therapies will be discussed  and a section that concentrates on the management of the subset of patients with a Hunner's lesion will be highlighted. BPS is today viewed through a new paradigm. It is no longer considered primarily a bladder disease  but rather one of a number of chronic pain syndromes that is distinguished by being manifest through bladder-related symptoms. A distinct subgroup of patients with Hunner's lesion has specific characteristics  and successful treatment of this subgroup is available.
General Practice,,,Adherence to COPD guidelines in general practice: impact of an educational programme delivered on location in Danish general practices. The general practitioner (GP) is often the first healthcare contact for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). To determine whether participating in a standardised educational programme delivered in the GP's own practice is associated with adherence to COPD guidelines. A nationwide register-based observational before and after study was undertaken with a control group of propensity-matched practices (follow-up period 6 months). COPD was defined as age 40+ years and at least two prescriptions for inhaled medication. The educational programme consisted of a 3-hr teaching lesson with a respiratory specialist and five visits by a representative from the sponsoring pharmaceutical company focusing on assessment and management of patients including written algorithms. A one-to-one propensity-matched control group of practices was selected. Register data were used to compare the rate of spirometry testing  preventive consultations  and influenza vaccinations provided to COPD patients and the rate of spirometry testing in non-COPD individuals  assumed to reflect diagnostic activity. Data for 102 participating GP practices were analysed. Participating clinics had a significant increase in preventive consultations and influenza vaccinations (p<0.05). For the control group  a significant change was observed only for influenza vaccinations. No significant change was found when comparing participating and control clinics in the difference-in-difference estimator. However  a significant improvement was observed for the subgroup of 48 clinics with the lowest starting point of spirometry testing. Focused education of GPs and their staff delivered in the GPs' own practices may improve adherence to COPD guidelines  not least for clinics with a high potential for improvement.
Cardiology,Epidemiology,,Mental health status and risk of new cardiovascular events or death in patients with myocardial infarction: a population-based cohort study. To examine the association between mental health status after first-time myocardial infarction (MI) and new cardiovascular events or death  taking into account depression and anxiety as well as clinical  sociodemographic and behavioural risk factors. Population-based cohort study based on questionnaires and nationwide registries. Mental health status was assessed 3 months after MI using the Mental Component Summary score from the Short-Form 12 V.2. Central Denmark Region. All patients hospitalised with first-time MI from 1 January 2009 through 31 December 2009 (n=880). The participants were categorised in quartiles according to the level of mental health status (first quartile=lowest mental health status). Composite endpoint of new cardiovascular events (MI  heart failure  stroke/transient ischaemic attack) and all-cause mortality. During 1940 person-years of follow-up  277 persons experienced a new cardiovascular event or died. The cumulative incidence following 3 years after MI increased consistently with decreasing mental health status and was 15% (95% CI 10.8% to 20.5%) for persons in the fourth quartile  29.1% (23.5% to 35.6%) in the third quartile  37.0% (30.9% to 43.9%) in the second quartile  and 47.5% (40.9% to 54.5%) in the first quartile. The HRs were high  even after adjustments for age  sociodemographic characteristics  cardiac disease severity  comorbidity  secondary prophylactic medication  smoking status  physical activity  depression and anxiety (HR3rd quartile 1.90 (95% CI 1.23 to 2.93)  HR2nd quartile 2.14 (1.37 to 3.33)  HR1st quartile 2.23 (1.35 to 3.68) when using the fourth quartile as reference). Low mental health status following first-time MI was independently associated with an increased risk of new cardiovascular events or death. Further research is needed to disentangle the pathways that link mental health status following MI to prognosis and to identify interventions that can improve mental health status and prognosis.
Family Practice,,,Psychological and social problems in primary care patients - general practitioners' assessment and classification. To estimate the frequency of psychological and social classification codes employed by general practitioners (GPs) and to explore the extent to which GPs ascribed health problems to biomedical  psychological  or social factors. A cross-sectional survey based on questionnaire data from GPs. Setting. Danish primary care. 387 GPs and their face-to-face contacts with 5543 patients. GPs registered consecutive patients on registration forms including reason for encounter  diagnostic classification of main problem  and a GP assessment of biomedical  psychological  and social factors' influence on the contact. The GP-stated reasons for encounter largely overlapped with their classification of the managed problem. Using the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC-2-R)  GPs classified 600 (11%) patients with psychological problems and 30 (0.5%) with social problems. Both codes for problems/complaints and specific disorders were used as the GP's diagnostic classification of the main problem. Two problems (depression and acute stress reaction/adjustment disorder) accounted for 51% of all psychological classifications made. GPs generally emphasized biomedical aspects of the contacts. Psychological aspects were given greater importance in follow-up consultations than in first-episode consultations  whereas social factors were rarely seen as essential to the consultation. Psychological problems are frequently seen and managed in primary care and most are classified within a few diagnostic categories. Social matters are rarely considered or classified.
General Practice,,,Case-finding and risk-group screening for depression in primary care. OBJECTIVE. Central health organizations suggest routine screening for depression in high-risk categories of primary care patients. This study compares the effectiveness of high-risk screening versus case-finding in identifying depression in primary care. DESIGN. Using an observational design  participating GPs included patients from 13 predefined risk groups and/or suspected of being depressed. Patients were assessed by the Major Depression Inventory (MDI) and ICD-10 criteria. Setting. Thirty-seven primary care practices in Mainland Denmark. Main outcome measures. Prevalence of depression  diagnostic agreement  effectiveness of screening methods  risk groups requiring special attention. RESULTS. A total of 37 (8.4%) of 440 invited GP practices participated. We found high-risk prevalence of depression in 672 patients for the following traits: (1) previous history of depression  (2) familial predisposition to depression  (3) chronic pain  (4) other mental disorders  and (5) refugee or immigrant. In the total sample  GPs demonstrated a depression diagnostic sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 67% using a case-finding strategy. GP diagnoses of depression agreed well with the MDI (AUC values of 0.91-0.99). The potential added value of high-risk screening was 4.6% (31/672). Patients with other mental disorders were at increased risk of having an unrecognized depression (PR 3.15  95% CI 1.91-5.20). If patients with other mental disorders were routinely tested  then 42% more depressed patients (14/31) would be recognized. CONCLUSIONS. A broad case-finding approach including a short validation test can help GPs identify depressed patients  particularly by including patients with other mental disorders in this strategy. This exploratory study cannot support the screening strategy proposed by central health organizations.
Family Practice,,,[Computer-based diagnosis of functional and mental disorders in general practice]. The use of psychometric tests is increasing in Danish general practice. The instruments are usually paper-based  but a few electronic instruments are now available  including the electronic Common Mental Disorder Questionnaire (e-CMDQ). The aim of the present study is to evaluate the applicability of the e-CMDQ in daily clinical work  the validity of data obtained  indications for use and the GP-perceived benefit of test results. Twenty GPs were invited to test the e-CMDQ during the period from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2005. They received a fee for using the instrument  equivalent to that received for using other validated psychiatric rating scales. Eleven GPs participated and included a total of 125 (average 11.4  range 2-36) patients during the test period. The average time spent on completing the e-CMDQ was 5.6 minutes. Data were almost complete with 4 499 out of 4 500 possible patient responses. The instrument was mainly used on suspicion of psychiatric morbidity  when problems had lasted for more than two weeks  when patients presented with multiple physical symptoms  and for test follow-up. The separate rating scales performed well: Cronbach's alpha 0.69-0.92 and Loevinger coefficients 0.30-0.91. The GPs considered the test results to be useful in 89 percent of the cases. The use of the e-CMDQ was associated with low time consumption  high data quality  sufficient construct validity and high user satisfaction. The instrument was only partly implemented and therefore barriers amenable to change should be brought into focus.
Dermatology,,,The effects of the El Niño Southern Oscillation on skin and skin-related diseases: a message from the International Society of Dermatology Climate Change Task Force. The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a complex climate phenomenon occurring in the Pacific Ocean at intervals of 2-7 years. The term refers to fluctuations in ocean temperatures in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean (El Niño [the warm phase of ENSO] and La Niña [the cool phase of ENSO]) and in atmospheric pressure across the Pacific basin (Southern Oscillation). This weather pattern is attributed with causing climate change in certain parts of the world and is associated with disease outbreaks. The question of how ENSO affects skin and skin-related disease is relatively unanswered. We aimed to review the literature describing the effects of this complex weather pattern on skin. El Niño has been associated with increases in the occurrence of actinic keratosis  tinea  pityriasis versicolor  miliaria  folliculitis  rosacea  dermatitis by Paederus irritans and Paederus sabaeus  and certain vector-borne and waterborne diseases  such as dengue fever  leishmaniasis  Chagas' disease  Barmah Forest virus  and leptospirosis  and with decreases in the occurrence of dermatitis  scabies  psoriasis  and papular urticaria. La Niña has been associated with increases in the occurrence of varicella  hand  foot  and mouth disease  and Ross River virus (in certain areas)  and decreases in viral warts and leishmaniasis. Reports on the effects of ENSO on skin and skin-related disease are limited  and more studies could be helpful in the future.
Pathology  Molecular,,,Optimal reference genes for normalization of qRT-PCR data from archival formalin-fixed  paraffin-embedded breast tumors controlling for tumor cell content and decay of mRNA. Reliable determination of gene-expression levels from qRT-PCR requires accurate normalization of target genes to reference genes in order to remove nonbiological variation. Reference genes are ideally constitutively expressed in every cell  but many genes used for normalization has been shown to vary with tissue type  cellular proliferation  cancer progression  and degradation of nucleic acids. Gene-expression analysis is increasingly performed on degraded mRNA from formalin-fixed  paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPE)  giving the option of examining retrospective cohorts. The aim of this study was to select robust reference genes showing stable expression over time in FFPE  controlling for various content of tumor tissue and decay of mRNA because of variable length of storage of the tissue. Sixteen reference genes were quantified by qRT-PCR in 40 FFPE breast tumor samples  stored for 1 to 29 years. Samples included 2 benign lesions and 38 carcinomas with varying tumor content. Stability of the reference genes were determined by the geNorm algorithm. mRNA was successfully extracted from all samples  and the 16 genes quantified in the majority of samples. Results showed 14% loss of amplifiable mRNA per year  corresponding to a half-life of 4.6 years. The 4 most stable expressed genes were CALM2  RPL37A  ACTB  and RPLP0. Several of the other examined genes showed considerably instability over time (GAPDH  PSMC4  OAZ1  IPO8). In conclusion  we identified 4 genes robustly expressed over time and independent of neoplastic tissue content in the FFPE block. Other widely used reference genes were concluded to be less suited for retrospective analysis of FFPE breast samples.
Epidemiology,,,Incidence of cancer in patients with chronic heart failure: a long-term follow-up study. With improvement in survival of chronic heart failure (HF)  the clinical importance of co-morbidity is increasing. The aim of this study was to assess the incidence and risk of cancer and all-cause mortality in a large Danish HF cohort. A total of 9307 outpatients with verified HF without a prior diagnosis of cancer (27% female  mean age 68 years  89% with LVEF <45%) were included in the study. A diagnosis of any cancer and all-cause mortality was obtained from Danish national registries. Outcome was compared with the general Danish population. Overall and type-specific risk of cancer was analysed in an adjusted Poisson and Cox regression analysis. The 975 diagnoses of cancer in the HF cohort and 330 843 in the background population corresponded to incidence rates per 10 000 patient-years of 188.9 [95% confidence interval (CI) 177.2-200.6] and 63.0 (95% CI 63.0-63.4)  respectively. When stratified by age  incidence rates were increased in all age groups in the HF cohort. Risk of any type of cancer was increased  with an incidence rate ratio of 1.24 (95% CI 1.15-1.33  c < 0.0001). Type-specific analysis demonstrated an increased hazard ratio for all major types of cancer except for prostate cancer. All-cause mortality was higher in HF patients with cancer compared with cancer patients from the background population. Patients with HF have an increased risk of cancer  which persists after the first year after the diagnosis of HF  and their prognosis is worse compared with that of cancer patients without HF.
Geriatric Nursing,Geriatrics,,[Impact of Geriatric Drug Guidelines on the Quality Requirement of Elderly Patients]. Elderly with several pathologies are usually treated with many drugs  and are exposed to a majored risk of drug-induced adverse effects. A network of local nursing homes (EHPAD) in the south Seine-Saint-Denis area (France) created a geriatric drug guidelines to improve the quality of the drugs prescriptions. This study assesses the conformity of prescriptions in elderly patients prior and after the distribution of the booklet. This before and after design study focused on the drug prescriptions for patients in eight EHPAD followed for two randomly given days in 2012 (n = 503) and 2013 (n = 334). The geriatric drug guidelines included a list of medicines suitable for the elderly (conformity list) and recommendations for prescription and monitoring. Data collection was conducted from medical records and interviews with coordinators doctors and nursing staff in nursing homes. A 6 items-quality score was calculated  ranging from 0 (lowest quality) to 6 (highest quality). Median age  weight and creatinine level were respectively 88 years  61.0 kg  and 74.9 μmol/L (prior) and 88 years  59.6 kg  and 77.0 μmol/L (after). Median times of latest serum creatinine dosage were 112 days (prior) and 108 days (after). The median number of prescribed drugs was 8 per resident during the two period of study. The conformity rate of prescription was better prior the distribution of the guidelines  respectively 87.5% and 80.0% (p<10⁻³). The average formal quality score was better after the distribution of the booklet increasing form 4.23 to 4.40 points (p<10⁻⁴). For high risk inducing drugs  monitoring was prescribed in 34.2% (prior) and 32.4% (after). This study shows that the drug geriatric guidelines does not improve prescription conformity and monitoring for high risk drugs  but it does significantly improve the median formal quality score.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Conducting radiogenomic research--do not forget careful consideration of the clinical data. The field of radiogenomics has evolved substantially over the last few years. Cooperative research groups have been established and high throughput genotyping has become increasingly feasible and affordable. Nevertheless  a number of clinical and dosimetric issues need to be carefully considered in order to fully exploit these new possibilities.
Pharmacogenetics,,,Will SNPs be useful predictors of normal tissue radiosensitivity in the future? The ability to predict individual risk of radiation-induced normal tissue complications is a long sought goal in radiobiology. The last decade saw increasing interest in identifying associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and normal tissue complication risk. Nevertheless  it remains controversial whether SNPs will be useful predictors of normal tissue radiosensitivity. This paper provides a summary of a scientific debate held at the 31st ESTRO conference in which four scientists argued in favor or against the motion that SNPs will be useful predictors of normal tissue radiosensitivity in the future.
Epidemiology,,,Incidence and mortality of herpes simplex encephalitis in Denmark: A nationwide registry-based cohort study. We aimed to investigate the incidence and mortality of herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) in a nationwide cohort. From the Danish National Patient Registry  we identified all adults hospitalised with a first-time diagnosis of HSE in Denmark during 2004-2014. The HSE diagnoses were verified using medical records and microbiological data. Patients were followed for mortality through the Danish Civil Registry System. We estimated age-standardised incidence rates of HSE and 30-day  60-day  and 1-year cumulative mortality. Furthermore  we assessed whether calendar year  age  gender  level of comorbidity  virus type  and department type was associated with HSE mortality. We identified a total of 230 cases of HSE. Median age was 60.7 years (interquartile range: 49.3-71.6). The overall incidence rate was 4.64 cases per million population per year (95% confidence interval: 4.06-5.28). The cumulative mortality within 30 days  60 days  and 1 year of the HSE admission was 8.3%  11.3%  and 18.6%  respectively. Advanced age and presence of comorbidity were associated with increased 60-day and 1-year mortality. This nationwide study of verified HSE found a higher incidence than reported in previous nationwide studies. Presence of comorbidity was identified as a novel adverse prognostic factor. Mortality rates following HSE remain high.
Epidemiology,,,Self-harm risk between adolescence and midlife in people who experienced separation from one or both parents during childhood. Experience of child-parent separation predicts adverse outcomes in later life. We conducted a detailed epidemiological examination of this complex relationship by modelling an array of separation scenarios and trajectories and subsequent risk of self-harm. This cohort study examined persons born in Denmark during 1971-1997. We measured child-parent separations each year from birth to 15th birthday via complete residential address records in the Civil Registration System. Self-harm episodes between 15th birthday and early middle age were ascertained through linkage to psychiatric and general hospital registers. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) from Poisson regression models were estimated against a reference category of individuals not separated from their parents. All exposure models examined indicated an association with raised self-harm risk. For example  large elevations in risk were observed in relation to separation from both parents at 15th birthday (IRR 5.50  95% CI 5.25-5.77)  experiencing five or more changes in child-parent separation status (IRR 5.24  CI 4.88-5.63)  and having a shorter duration of familial cohesion during upbringing. There was no significant evidence for varying strength of association according to child's gender. Measuring child-parent separation according to differential residential addresses took no account of the reason for or circumstances of these separations. These novel findings suggest that self-harm prevention initiatives should be tailored toward exposed persons who remain psychologically distressed into adulthood. These high-risk subgroups include individuals with little experience of familial cohesion during their upbringing  those with the most complicated trajectories who lived through multiple child-parent separation transitions  and those separated from both parents during early adolescence.
Family Practice,,,[Developing training in critical appraisal for GP trainees in the Eastern Region of Denmark]. In 2004 training in critical appraisal became a mandatory part of the Danish medical specialist training. In this article we describe how the course was designed and implemented on the basis of experience from previous research training initiatives targeting GPs and GP-trainees; and how we continuously develop the course and tailor the training of teachers for the course using a multi-method participatory evaluation design  theoretically based on Stenhouse's definition of the curriculum as a process and the teachers as researchers.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Interventions to improve the management of diabetes mellitus in primary health care and outpatient community settings]. This review should be cited as: Renders CM  Valk GD  Griffin S. Wagner EH  Eijk JThM van  Assendelft WJJ. Interventions to improve the management of diabetes mellitus in primary care  outpatient and community settings (Cochrane Review). In: The Cochrane Library  Issue 2  2001. Oxford: Update Software. A substantive amendment to this systematic review was last made on 29 June 2000. Cochrane reviews are regularly checked and updated if necessary. Diabetes is a common chronic disease that is increasingly managed in primary care. Different systems have been proposed to manage diabetes care. To assess the effects of different interventions  targeted at health professionals or the structure in which they deliver care  on the management of patients with diabetes in primary care  outpatient and community settings. We searched the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group specialised register  the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 4 1999)  MEDLINE (1966-1999)  EMBASE (1980-1999)  Cinahl (1982-1999)  and reference lists of articles. Randomised trials (RCTs)  controlled clinical trials (CCTs)  controlled before and after studies (CBAs) and interrupted time series (ITS) analyses of professional  financial and organisational strategies aimed at improving care for people with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. The participants were health care professionals  including physicians  nurses and pharmacists. The outcomes included objectively measured health professional performance or patient outcomes  and self-report measures with known validity and reliability. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality. Forty-one studies were included involving more than 200 practices and 48 000 patients. Twenty-seven studies were RCTs  12 were CBAs  and two were ITS. The studies were heterogeneous in terms of interventions  participants  settings and outcomes. The methodological quality of the studies was often poor. In all studies the intervention strategy was multifaceted. In 12 studies the interventions were targeted at health professionals  in nine they were targeted at the organization of care  and 20 studies targeted both. In 15 studies patient education was added to the professional and organisational interventions. A combination of professional interventions improved process outcomes. The effect on patient outcomes remained less clear as these were rarely assessed. Arrangements for follow-up (organisational intervention) also showed a favourable effect on process outcomes. Multiple interventions in which patient education was added or in which the role of the nurse was enhanced also reported favourable effects on patients' health outcomes. REVIEWERS' CONCLUSION: Multifaceted professional interventions can enhance the performance of health professionals in managing patients with diabetes. Organisational interventions that improve regular prompted recall and review of patients (central computerised tracking systems or nurses who regularly contact the patient) can also improve diabetes management. The addition of patient-oriented interventions can lead to improved patient health outcomes. Nurses can play an important role in patient-oriented interventions  through patient education or facilitating adherence to treatment.
Molecular Epidemiology,,,Comparing whole-genome sequencing with Sanger sequencing for spa typing of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. spa typing of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has traditionally been done by PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing of the spa repeat region. At Hvidovre Hospital  Denmark  whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of all MRSA isolates has been performed routinely since January 2013  and an in-house analysis pipeline determines the spa types. Due to national surveillance  all MRSA isolates are sent to Statens Serum Institut  where the spa type is determined by PCR and Sanger sequencing. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reliability of the spa types obtained by 150-bp paired-end Illumina WGS. MRSA isolates from new MRSA patients in 2013 (n = 699) in the capital region of Denmark were included. We found a 97% agreement between spa types obtained by the two methods. All isolates achieved a spa type by both methods. Nineteen isolates differed in spa types by the two methods  in most cases due to the lack of 24-bp repeats in the whole-genome-sequenced isolates. These related but incorrect spa types should have no consequence in outbreak investigations  since all epidemiologically linked isolates  regardless of spa type  will be included in the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. This will reveal the close relatedness of the spa types. In conclusion  our data show that WGS is a reliable method to determine the spa type of MRSA.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Translational medicine in the field of ablative fractional laser (AFXL)-assisted drug delivery: A critical review from basics to current clinical status. Ablative fractional lasers enhance uptake of topical therapeutics and the concept of fractional laser-assisted drug delivery has now been taken into clinical practice. We systematically reviewed preclinical data and clinical evidence for fractional lasers to enhance drug uptake and improve clinical efficacy. We searched PubMed and Embase databases; 34 articles met the inclusion criteria. Studies were categorized into experimental preclinical studies and clinical trials  the latter graded according to level of evidence. All preclinical trials (n = 16) documented enhanced topical drug uptake into skin after ablative fractional laser treatment. Clinical evidence encompassed 18 studies  of which 9 were randomized controlled trials and 2 were controlled trials  examining neoplastic lesions  photodamaged skin  scars  onychomycosis  and topical anesthetics. The highest level of evidence was reached for actinic keratoses treated with methylaminolevulinate for photodynamic therapy (level IB  5 randomized controlled trials)  substantiating superior and long-lasting efficacy versus conventional photodynamic therapy. No adverse events were reported  but ablative fractional laser-assisted drug delivery implies risks of systemic drug absorption  especially when performed over large skin areas. Fractional laser-assisted drug delivery is beneficial in enhancing preclinical and clinical outcomes for certain skin conditions.
Nursing,,,Postoperative wound infections after a proctectomy-Patient experiences. Poor perineal wound healing and infections after proctectomy surgery cause a significant proportion of physical and psychological morbidities  such as pain  leakage  and abscesses. In the long run  some of these symptoms will lead to extended periods of hospitalization. These kinds of postoperative complications are also associated with delays in possible chemotherapy treatment. The aim of this study was to describe patient experiences of perineal wound infections following proctectomy due to rectal cancer  and the importance of the communication with and the self-care support from the nurse for these patients. Five women and five men (61-87 years  median age 71 years) were included and interviewed. A qualitative content analysis of the interviews was carried out and the following main categories emerged: "Managing postoperative complications " "Being independent " "Feeling safe " and "Accepting the situation." A perineal wound infection after a proctectomy is devastating for the individual patient. The limitations and changes to the patients' lives turn into new daily routines  which force them to find new ways to live and to accept the situation. For many of them  the infections remained for several months and  sometimes  for years. The ability to lead an independent life is drastically reduced  but through continuity in care it is possible to create a feeling of safety. Information  communication  and self-care support are all important and valuable factors for recovery. Specialized care containing an action plan is therefore needed in clinical practice to reduce the number of perineal wound infections postoperatively and should be initiated when the patient is discharged from the ward and continue until recovery.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Quality of dementia diagnostic evaluation for ethnic minority patients: a nationwide study. Diagnostic evaluation of dementia for ethnic minority patients may be challenging. This study aimed to evaluate the quality of diagnostic evaluation of dementia for patients from ethnic minorities in Denmark. The Danish national hospital registers were used to identify patients from the main ethnic minority groups in Denmark  who were diagnosed with dementia in the period 2005-2007. Three raters independently reviewed the patients' medical records. Data were compared to data from a previous similar study in the general Danish population. Fifty-seven medical records were reviewed. An acceptable diagnostic workup was documented in only 23% of the patients. Dementia diagnosis was confirmed in 35%. Significant differences in the quality of the diagnostic evaluation were found between patients from ethnic minorities and the general population. There are significant ethnic disparities in the quality of diagnostic evaluations and outcome of dementia in the secondary healthcare sector.
Specialization,,,Diagnostic evaluation of dementia in the secondary health care sector. We conducted a nationwide registry-based study of the quality of diagnostic evaluation for dementia in the secondary health care sector. Two hundred patients were randomly selected from the patient population (4 682 patients) registered for the first time with a dementia diagnosis in the nationwide hospital registries during the last 6 months of 2003. Through medical record review  we evaluated the completeness of the work-up on which the dementia diagnosis was based  using evidence-based dementia guidelines as reference standards. Satisfactory or acceptable completion of the basic dementia work-up was documented in 51.3% of the patients. Only 11.5% of those with unsatisfactory work-up were referred to follow-up investigations. Dementia syndrome was confirmed in 88.5% of the cases  but correct subtypes were diagnosed in only 35.1%. The adherence to clinical guidelines concerning dementia work-up is inadequate in the secondary health care sector. Our findings call for improvement in the organization of clinical dementia care  for education of specialists and for changes in attitude towards making a diagnosis of dementia.
Pediatrics,,,[Non-attendance at a pediatric outpatient clinic. SMS text messaging improves attendance]. To assess whether short message service (SMS) text message reminders would reduce non-attendance at a paediatric outpatient clinic. Furthermore  we wanted to clarify the families' attitude towards receiving an SMS reminder. In a prospective cohort study we compared non-attendance among families who did/did not receive an SMS reminder. All patients with an appointment at the paediatric outpatient clinic in weeks 37 to 44  2006 were included except those who were attending specific immunotherapy. By use of a computer program  the SMS reminders were sent to families with an appointment at the clinic in weeks 38  40  42 and 44. The families attending the clinic during these weeks were also asked to complete a questionnaire. Among families who did/did not receive an SMS reminder  the non-attendance was 10.0% and 5.9%  respectively. The relative risk was 1.7 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-2.7). Sixty-eight (41.7%) of the parents stated  that the SMS reminder helped them remember their appointment. A total of 155 (95.1%) would like to receive an SMS reminder before future appointments in the clinic. Only seven (2.6%) were offended by the SMS reminder. SMS reminders reduced non-attendance at the paediatric outpatient clinic.
Gastroenterology,,,How to cannulate? A survey of the Scandinavian Association for Digestive Endoscopy (SADE) in 141 endoscopists. Cannulation of the papilla vateri represents an enigmatic first step in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP). In light of falling numbers of (diagnostic) ERCP and novel techniques  e.g. short-wire system  we were interested in the approach novice and experienced endoscopist are taking; especially  what makes a papilla difficult to cannulate and how to approach this. We devised a structured online questionnaire  sent to all endoscopists registered with SADE  the Scandinavian Association for Digestive Endoscopy. A total of 141 responded. Of those  49 were experienced ERCP-endoscopists (>900 ERCPs). The first choice of cannulation is with a sphincterotome and a preinserted wire. Both less experienced and more experienced endoscopists agreed on the criteria to describe a papilla difficult to cannulate and both would choose the needle-knife sphincterotomy (NKS) to get access to the bile duct. The less experienced used more "upward" NKS  whereas the more experienced also used the "downward" NKS technique. This survey provides us with a database allowing now for a more differentiated view on cannulation techniques  success  and outcome in terms of pancreatitis.
Urology,,,Contemporary Practice Patterns of Flexible Ureteroscopy for Treating Renal Stones: Results of a Worldwide Survey. Flexible ureteroscopy (fURS) is increasingly used in the treatment of renal stones. However  wide variations exist in technique  use  and indications. To better inform our knowledge about the contemporary state of fURS for treating renal stones  we conducted a survey of endourologists worldwide. An anonymous online questionnaire assessing fURS treatment of renal stones  consisting of 36 items  was sent to members of the Endourology Society in October 2014. Responses were collected through the SurveyMonkey system over a 3-month period. Questionnaires were answered by 414 surgeons from 44 countries (response rate 20.7%). U.S. surgeons accounted for 34.4% of all respondents. fURS was routinely performed in 80.0% of institutions  with 40.0% of surgeons performing >100 cases/year. Respondents considered fURS to be first-line therapy for patients with renal stones <2 cm and lower pole calculi. A substantial minority (11.3%) preferred fURS as a primary treatment modality for renal stones >2 cm. Basket displacement for lower pole stones was routinely performed by 55.8%. Ureteral access sheaths (UAS) were preferred for every case by 58.3%. Respondents frequently utilized high-power lasers and dusting techniques. Criteria for determining stone-free rate were defined as zero fragments or residual fragment (RF) <1  <2  <3  and <4 mm by 30.9%  8.9%  31.5%  15.8%  and 11.2% of respondents  respectively. The overwhelming majority of endourologists surveyed consider fURS as a first-line treatment modality for renal stones  especially those <2 cm. Use of UAS  high-power holmium lasers  and dusting technique has become popular among practitioners. When defining stone free after fURS  the majority of endourologists used a zero fragment or RF <2 mm definition.
Clinical Medicine,Specialties  Surgical,,Pharmacist advice is accepted more for medical than for surgical patients in an emergency department. Pharmacists' advice may reduce medication errors in the emergency department (ED). However  pharmacists' recommendations are of little value if not acknowledged by physicians. The aim of the present study was to analyze how often and which categories of pharmacist recommendations were taken into account by the physicians in a Danish ED. Special attention is paid to problems of significant or vital importance. Clinical pharmacists reviewed patient files within 24 hours of admission  described medication issues and made recommendations for solutions. It was subsequently noted whether the recommendations were taken into account by the physicians. Independent specialists in internal medicine and geriatrics reviewed the recommendations and assessed whether they were of minimal  moderate  significant or vital importance. Among the 301 recommendations made  59% were followed by the physicians. The physician followed the recommendation made for patients admitted with medical problems significantly more often than the recommendations made for surgical patients (69% versus 51%  p = 0.002). In 47%  the recommendations were of significant or vital importance. Even these recommendations were acknowledged more by the physicians caring for medical patients than by physicians caring for surgical patients (78% versus 57%  p = 0.009). The difference remained significant in the multivariate analysis. Even though the pharmacists' recommendations were followed in many cases in an ED  there is still room for improvement  especially for the surgical patients. The Amgros Research Foundation covered the costs for the independent specialists who reviewed the patient files. NCT01723462 (clinicaltrial.gov).
Adolescent Psychiatry,Child Psychiatry,,Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders. The DSM-5 list of diagnoses concerning schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders is expected to be revised and graduated from mild to severe. The proposed changes for the diagnosis of schizophrenia affect demands for characteristic symptoms  clarify relation to pervasive developmental disorders  and eliminate the classic subtypes of schizophrenia. A dimensional assessment will be measured on a 0-4 point scale. It is recommended that the concept of attenuated psychosis syndrome is further investigated. The propositions affecting characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia might increase diagnostic reliability and validity  but it is estimated to exclude about 2 % of patients currently diagnosed with DSM-IV schizophrenia from fulfilling criteria for DSM-5 schizophrenia. It might generate a problem for future young patients if the changes concerning demands on characteristic symptoms turn out to be more restrictive  leaving out a percentage of patients with psychotic symptoms from a diagnosis of schizophrenia; which in practice opens possibilities for intensive treatment options. On the other hand  not including attenuated psychosis syndrome at the present might protect patients from stigmatization and pharmacological treatment on poor indication. The introduction of dimensional assessments may make schizophrenia subtyping redundant and has the potential to enrich clinical practice and bridge communication between child and adolescent and adult psychiatry. The most recent guidelines for assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with schizophrenia are from 2001. They provide differentiated recommendations regarding diagnostics  assessment of symptoms and functioning and treatment strategies. There is an urgent need for updated guidelines in this field  especially concerning specific treatment guidelines.
Adolescent Psychiatry,Child Psychiatry,,[Psychosis in childhood and adolescence. Psychopathology and differential diagnoses]. Psychosis in childhood and adolescence is rare. Psychotic manifestations in childhood are associated with diagnostic diversities. The diagnostic group pervasive developmental disorder  not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) are often used in childhood and may be a precursor of schizophrenia or affective psychosis. In this short review  expressions of psychosis in childhood and adolescence are listed and discussed. The authors speak in favour of a closer collaboration between child- and adolescent psychiatry and adult psychiatry clinically as well as in research contexts to expand the knowledge about the genesis and aetiology of psychoses.
Public Health,,,Persistent high incidence of tuberculosis in immigrants in a low-incidence country. Immigration from areas of high incidence is thought to have fueled the resurgence of tuberculosis (TB) in areas of low incidence. To reduce the risk of disease in low-incidence areas  the main countermeasure has been the screening of immigrants on arrival. This measure is based on the assumption of a prompt decline in the incidence of TB in immigrants during their first few years of residence in a country with low overall incidence. We have documented that this assumption is not true for 619 Somali immigrants reported in Denmark as having TB. The annual incidence of TB declined only gradually during the first 7 years of residence  from an initial 2 000 per 100 000 to 700 per 100 000. The decline was described by an exponential function with a half-time of 5.7 (95% confidence interval 4.0 to 9.7) years. This finding seriously challenges the adequacy of the customary practice of screening solely on arrival.
Psychiatric Rehabilitation,,,Competing priorities: staff perspectives on supporting recovery. Recovery has come to mean living a life beyond mental illness  and recovery orientation is policy in many countries. The aims of this study were to investigate what staff say they do to support recovery and to identify what they perceive as barriers and facilitators associated with providing recovery-oriented support. Data collection included ten focus groups with multidisciplinary clinicians (n = 34) and team leaders (n = 31)  and individual interviews with clinicians (n = 18)  team leaders (n = 6) and senior managers (n = 8). The identified core category was Competing Priorities  with staff identifying conflicting system priorities that influence how recovery-oriented practice is implemented. Three sub-categories were: Health Process Priorities  Business Priorities  and Staff Role Perception. Efforts to transform services towards a recovery orientation require a whole-systems approach.
Environmental Health,Gynecology,Obstetrics,Medical education for obstetricians and gynecologists should incorporate environmental health. Obstetricians-gynecologists can protect the reproductive health of women  men  and their offspring from environmental hazards through preconception and prenatal counseling and encouraging patients to take actions to reduce environmental exposures. Although obstetricians-gynecologists are well positioned to prevent hazardous exposures  education on environmental health in medical education is limited. The Mid-Atlantic Center for Children's Health and the Environment and the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of George Washington University convened a meeting to begin integration of environmental health topics into medical education for obstetricians-gynecologists. Several avenues were identified to incorporate environmental health topics into medical education including continuing education requirements  inclusion of environmental health questions on board certification examinations and the creation of a curriculum on environmental health specific to obstetrics-gynecology.
General Practice,,,Association of lipoprotein levels with mortality in subjects aged 50 + without previous diabetes or cardiovascular disease: a population-based register study. This study aimed to investigate the association of lipoprotein and triglyceride levels with all-cause mortality in a population free from diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) at baseline. The European Guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention state that in general total cholesterol (TC) should be < 5 mmol/L (190 mg/dL) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) should be < 3 mmol/L (115 mg/dL). A population-based register study in the period 1999-2007 including 118 160 subjects aged 50 + without statin use at baseline. All-cause mortality was related to lipoprotein and triglyceride levels and adjusted for statin use after inclusion. All-cause mortality was lower in the groups with TC or LDL-C above the recommended levels. Compared with subjects with TC < 5 mmol/L  adjusted hazard ratios for the group aged 60-70 years ranged from 0.68 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61-0.77) for TC 5-5.99 mmol/L to 0.67 (95% CI 0.59-0.75) for TC 6-7.99 mmol/L and 1.02 (95% CI 0.68-1.53) for TC ≥ 8 mmol/L in males and from 0.57 (95% CI 0.48-0.67) to 0.59 (95% CI 0.50-0.68) and 1.02 (95% CI: 0.77-1.37) in females. For triglycerides  ratios compared with the group < 1 mmol/L in the females aged 60-70 years ranged from 1.04 (95% CI 0.88-1.23) to 1.35 (95% CI 1.10-1.66) and 1.25 (95% CI 1.05-1.48) for triglycerides 1-1.39 mmol/L  1.4-1.69 mmol/L  and ≥ 1.7 mmol/L  respectively. Statin treatment after inclusion provided a survival benefit. These associations indicate that high lipoprotein levels do not seem to be definitely harmful in the general population. However  high triglyceride levels in females are associated with decreased survival.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Number-needed-to-treat (NNT)--needs treatment with care. The "number-needed-to-treat" (NNT) was introduced about 15 years ago and has gained widespread use. It has been claimed to be "easy to understand" and gives "intuitive meaning". When used to measure the effectiveness of interventions targeting chronic disease processes e.g. atherosclerosis and osteoporosis  NNT (as well as relative and absolute risk reduction) does not capture the crucial time component  a fact that has important consequences: NNT varies over time  it may not mean that adverse events (fractures  myocardial infarctions etc.) are avoided  but simply that they are postponed. Finally  empirical studies indicate that lay people and doctors misunderstand NNT. We recommend that NNT be used with considerable care. There is probably no single effect measure that is able to convey all necessary information.
Allergy and Immunology,,,Characterization and potential clinical applications of autoantibodies against cytokines. Autoantibodies recognizing cytokines arise in certain patients during the course of therapy with recombinant cytokines  although they may arise spontaneously as well. They are typically high avidity and in vitro neutralizing IgG antibodies present in picomolar to nanomolar concentrations. Methodology is therefore critical. Quantitative studies based on sound methodology strongly indicate that nanomolar levels of cytokine autoantibodies are likely to be involved in a number of "new" syndromes such as acquired immune deficiencies  lung diseases  and certain age-related manifestations. There are many ways in which the autoantibodies could be naturally induced  and they have been experimentally induced with ease. Therefore  a new therapeutic concept of inducing cytokine autoantibodies via anti-cytokine vaccination is currently rapidly emerging.
Gynecology,Specialization,,Current attitudes on self-use and prescription of hormone therapy among New York City gynaecologists. The results of the Women's Health Initiative studies dramatically altered hormone therapy use around the world. In countries outside the United States  self-use in physicians remained unaltered while prescription use declined  implying that physicians may not concur with the findings. We wished to explore prevailing attitudes among American physicians by examining New York City obstetrician-gynaecologists' self-use and prescription use of hormone therapy. All board-certified obstetrician-gynaecologists in New York City were invited to complete and return a detailed  previously validated questionnaire concerning hormone therapy use. Two hundred and nine questionnaires were returned  for a response rate of 12% (209/1797). Gynaecologists agreed with the findings from the Women's Health Initiative studies regarding indications and contraindications to hormone therapy use. Even so  three-quarters of female gynaecologists and female partners of male gynaecologists (74%; 67/91) use or have previously used hormone therapy. However  only 27.3% (21/77) of male gynaecologists and 12.3% (14/114) of female gynaecologists recommend hormone therapy to all menopausal women regardless of contraindications. Gynaecologists remain divided in their attitude toward hormone therapy; 30% of gynaecologists felt that hormone therapy use generally prolonged women's lives  36% felt it was not useful in prolonging women's lives  and 33% were unsure. Since the publication of the Women's Health Initiative findings  New York City gynaecologists prescribe hormone therapy to fewer patients. However  they continue to self-use hormone therapy at much higher rates  even as they seem to concur with Women's Health Initiative recommendations  contributing to the ongoing controversy surrounding the validity of the Women's Health Initiative findings.
Gynecology,,,Impact of recent studies on attitudes and use of hormone therapy among Scandinavian gynaecologists. Climacteric medicine has been in focus during the last 2 decades  and an intensive debate has been ongoing regarding the positive and negative aspects of postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT). Recent randomised controlled studies have been unable to confirm data from observational studies of primary or secondary preventive effects of HT on coronary heart disease  and other studies have indicated an increased risk of breast cancer  stroke and venous thromboembolism among HT users. In 2001  we reported on knowledge  attitudes  management strategies and use of HT among Scandinavian gynaecologists. The aim of the present study was to re-assess the same parameters concerning HT among Scandinavian gynaecologists in 2002-2003  and compare the results with the data collected in 1995-1997. All practicing gynaecologists in Denmark  Sweden and Norway were invited by letter to complete and return a questionnaire regarding their knowledge  attitudes and management strategies concerning HT. Female gynaecologists were questioned if they were currently using HT  and the same question was posed concerning spouses of male gynaecologists. The questionnaire was completed and returned by 60  76 and 72%  respectively of gynaecologists in Denmark  Sweden and Norway. Of the 1 591 physicians who responded  13% thought that all women should be offered HT provided there were no contraindications  while 86% recommended HT only to selected women after considering the individual advantages and disadvantages of the treatment. Of the gynaecologists  37% considered HT to be without relevance in the primary prevention of osteoporosis in healthy women. As for duration of the treatment  40% of the gynaecologists would recommend HT for <5 years for the treatment of climacteric complaints  and only 8% would recommend HT for >10 years. The prevalence of HT use among the menopausal female gynaecologists varied between 71 and 74%. Among the menopausal spouses of male gynaecologists  68-72% were current users of HT. During the last years of ongoing debate  gynaecologists from Denmark  Sweden and Norway have become more modest in their recommendations of postmenopausal HT. Scandinavian specialists are more cautious in prescribing hormones for women with symptomatic CVD or previously treated for breast cancer  however  their personal use of HT has not changed dramatically and still reflects a positive attitude.
Telemedicine,,,Do telemedical interventions improve quality of life in patients with COPD? A systematic review. Telehealth is an approach to disease management  which may hold the potential of improving some of the features associated with COPD  including positive impact on disease progression  and thus possibly limiting further reduction in quality of life (QoL). Our objective was  therefore  to summarize studies addressing the impact of telehealth on QoL in patients with COPD. Systematic review. A series of systematic searches were carried out using the following databases: PubMed  EMBASE  Cochrane Controlled Trials Register  and ClinicalTrials.gov (last updated November 2015). A predefined search algorithm was utilized with the intention to capture all results related to COPD  QoL  and telehealth published since year 2000. Primary outcome was QoL  assessed by validated measures. Out of the 18 studies fulfilling the criteria for inclusion in this review  three studies found statistically significant improvements in QoL for patients allocated to telemedical interventions. However  all of the other included studies found no statistically significant differences between control and telemedical intervention groups in terms of QoL. Telehealth does not make a strong case for itself when exclusively looking at QoL as an outcome  since statistically significant improvements relative to control groups have been observed only in few of the available studies. Nonetheless  this does not only rule out the possibility that telehealth is superior to standard care with regard to other outcomes but also seems to call for more research  not least in large-scale controlled trials.
Telemedicine,,,Effect of tele health care on exacerbations and hospital admissions in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a randomized clinical trial. Tele monitoring (TM) of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has gained much interest  but studies have produced conflicting results. Our aim was to investigate the effect of TM with the option of video consultations on exacerbations and hospital admissions in patients with severe COPD. Patients with severe COPD at high risk of exacerbations were eligible for the study. Of 560 eligible patients identified  279 (50%) declined to participate. The remaining patients were equally randomized to either TM (n=141) or usual care (n=140) for the 6-month study period. TM comprised recording of symptoms  saturation  spirometry  and weekly video consultations. Algorithms generated alerts if readings breached thresholds. Both groups received standard care. The primary outcome was number of hospital admissions for exacerbation of COPD during the study period. Most of the enrolled patients had severe COPD (forced expiratory volume in 1 second <50%pred in 86% and ≥hospital admission for COPD in the year prior to enrollment in 45%  respectively  of the patients). No difference in drop-out rate and mortality was found between the groups. With regard to the primary outcome  no significant difference was found in hospital admissions for COPD between the groups (P=0.74)  and likewise  no difference was found in time to first admission or all-cause hospital admissions. Compared with the control group  TM group patients had more moderate exacerbations (ie  treated with antibiotics/corticosteroid  but not requiring hospital admission; P<0.001)  whereas the control group had more visits to outpatient clinics (P<0.001). Our study of patients with severe COPD showed that TM including video consultations as add-on to standard care did not reduce hospital admissions for exacerbated COPD  but TM may be an alternative to visits at respiratory outpatient clinics. Further studies are needed to establish the optimal role of TM in the management of severe COPD.
Adolescent Psychiatry,,,ICD-10 classification in Danish child and adolescent psychiatry--have diagnoses changed after the introduction of ICD-10? The aim was to test this in a nationwide register study of diagnoses used in child and adolescents psychiatry in Denmark. A larger number of different diagnoses were expected to be applied after the introduction of the 10th version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). Reflecting the time trend  we particularly expected an increase in the number of neuropsychiatric diagnoses. From the Danish Psychiatric Central Register data were drawn on clinical discharge diagnoses. All patients aged 0-15 years examined at psychiatric hospitals from 1995-2002 were included; 22 469 children and adolescents with a first contact were registered. The most frequent discharge diagnoses were pervasive development disorders (PDD; 11.9%)  adjustment disorders (10.6%)  conduct disorder (9.5%)  emotional and anxiety disorders (7.6%)  hyperkinetic disorders (7.3%)  and specific developmental disorders (7.3%). We found a significant increase in the number of neuropsychiatric and affective diagnoses and a significant decrease in the number of adjustment  conduct and anxiety diagnoses during the study period. Of the 22 469 diagnoses  45% were only partly specified according to ICD-10. Thirty-four per cent had diagnoses unspecified on the four-character level (Fxx.9) and 11% had Z-diagnoses. A larger number of different diagnoses and an increase in the use of neuropsychiatric diagnoses were seen after the introduction of ICD-10. Many diagnoses were only partly specified; consequently  a more detailed specification of the ICD-10 is still required.
Ophthalmology,Epidemiology,,PREGO (presentation of Graves' orbitopathy) study: changes in referral patterns to European Group On Graves' Orbitopathy (EUGOGO) centres over the period from 2000 to 2012. The epidemiology of Graves' orbitopathy (GO) may be changing. The aim of the study was to identify trends in presentation of GO to tertiary centres and initial management over time. Prospective observational study of European Group On Graves' Orbitopathy (EUGOGO) centres. All new referrals with a diagnosis of GO over a 4-month period in 2012 were included. Clinical and demographic characteristics  referral timelines and initial decisions about management were recorded. The data were compared with a similar EUGOGO survey performed in 2000. The demographic characteristics of 269 patients studied in 2012 were similar to those collected in the year 2000  including smoking rates (40.0% vs 40.2%). Mild (60.5% vs 41.2%  p<0.01) and inactive GO (63.2% vs 39.9%  p<0.01) were more prevalent in 2012. The times from diagnosis of thyroid disease to being seen in EUGOGO centres (6 vs 16 months) and from first symptoms of GO (9 vs 16 months) or from diagnosis of GO (6 vs 12 months) to first consultation in EUGOGO centres were shorter in 2012 (p<0.01). The initial management plans for GO were no different except surgical treatments for patients with mild inactive disease were more frequently offered in the 2012 cohort than in 2000 (27.3% vs 17%  p<0.05)  and selenium supplements were offered only in the 2012 cohort (21.2% vs 0%  p<0.01). These findings suggest that the clinical manifestations of patients with GO may be changing over time in Europe.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Oncological treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer]. Only radical resection can cure patients with pancreatic cancer (PC); however  adjuvant gemcitabine (GEM) doubles the postoperative five-year-survival. The best treatment of locally advanced PC is not established  but radio-chemotherapy followed by surgery may be considered. Fit patients with metastatic PC benefit from GEM  which is standard. The addition of the epidermal growth factor-receptor-inhibitor erlotinib prolongs median survival significantly by two weeks and one-year survival by 7%. Very fit patients might benefit by combining GEM with platinum or capecitabine  but evidence is not firm. Participation in clinical trials is strongly encouraged in PC.
Optometry,Public Health,,Patient tobacco use in optometric practice: a Canada-wide study. A national census survey of optometrists in Canada measured knowledge of ocular diseases associated with smoking cigarettes and current practice behaviors related to addressing tobacco use with patients  including prevention and cessation. Optometrists were also asked to identify tools to assist addressing tobacco use with patients. An online bilingual (English/French) survey was developed and an e-mail with a link to the survey was sent to all 4528 optometrists registered in Canada. No participation incentives were provided. Frequency data were tabulated for survey items. Logistic regression models were fit to understand respondent characteristics associated with discussing tobacco use prevention and cessation with patients. The response rate was 19% (850 responses). Almost all respondents (98%) believed that smoking cigarettes was a risk factor for developing age-related macular degeneration; approximately half (55%) assessed the smoking status of patients during their initial visit; 7% reported that they discussed the benefits of tobacco use prevention with patients younger than 19 years; and 33% reported that they always or regularly assess their patients' interest in quitting smoking. Respondents who completed the survey in English were more likely (odds ratio  2.4; 95% confidence interval  1.01 to 5.65) to deliver prevention messaging  compared with respondents who completed the survey in French. Male respondents were less likely to assess patients' interest in quitting (odds ratio  0.7; 95% confidence interval  0.50 to 0.97) than female respondents. Most respondents (90%) were interested in a continuing education program about the impact of smoking on vision and eye health as well as strategies for discussing tobacco cessation and prevention. Optometrists are aware of the impact of smoking on ocular health; however  most respondents do not systematically engage in tobacco use prevention and cessation practices. Providing optometrists with tools  including continuing education  may help support patient conversations about the risks of tobacco use and improve public health.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Exploring arts-based knowledge translation: sharing research findings through performing the patterns  rehearsing the results  staging the synthesis. Cultivation of knowledge translation (KT) strategies that actively engage health professionals in critical reflection of their practice and research-based evidence are imperative to address the research-practice gap. While research-based evidence is exponentially growing  our ability to facilitate uptake by nurses and other health professionals has not kept pace. Innovative approaches that extend epistemological bias beyond a singular standpoint of postpositivism  such as the utilization of arts-based methods  expand the possibility to address the complexities of context  engage audience members  promote dissemination within communities of practice  and foster new audiences interested in research findings. In this paper  we address the importance of adopting a social constructivist epistemological stance to facilitate knowledge translation to diverse audiences  explore various arts-based knowledge translation (ABKT) strategies  and open a dialogue concerning evaluative tenets of ABKT. ABKT utilizes various art forms to disseminate research knowledge to diverse audiences and promote evidence-informed practice. ABKT initiatives translate knowledge not based upon a linear model  which views knowledge as an objective entity  but rather operate from the premise that knowledge is socially situated  which demands acknowledging and engaging the learner within their context. Theatre  dance  photography  and poetry are art forms that are commonly used to communicate research findings to diverse audiences. Given the emerging interest and importance of utilizing this KT strategy situated within a social constructivist epistemology  potential challenges and plausible evaluative criteria specific to ABKT are presented. ABKT is an emerging KT strategy that is grounded in social constructivist epistemological tenets  and holds potential for meaningfully sharing new research knowledge with diverse audiences. ABKT is an innovative and synergistic approach to traditional dissemination strategies. This creative KT approach is emerging as potent transformational learning tools that are congruent with the relational nature of nursing practice. ABKT facilitates learning about new research findings in an engaging and critical reflective manner that promotes learning within communities of practice.
Optometry,,,Smoking cessation referrals in optometric practice: a canadian pilot study. The current pilot study sought to understand optometrists' attitudes toward addressing tobacco use within the scope of their practice  and to identify opportunities within Canada to integrate optometrists as health care partners into the national tobacco cessation network. A descriptive qualitative design was used to conduct this pilot study. Five focus groups were conducted with 29 informants  including 11 practicing community optometrists and 18 senior Doctor of Optometry students from the University of Waterloo. Rationales  barriers  and opportunities to practice patterns were identified. Optometrists and optometry students knew the association of smoking with eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and cataract; however  some informants selectively asked patients about smoking behavior based on patient age or visit type. Most informants indicated that they did inform their patients who smoke of their increased risk of developing certain eye diseases; however  very few informants assessed whether their patients wanted to stop smoking and no informants reported that they had ever provided a patient with explicit support for tobacco cessation. This limited role in smoking cessation support for patients due  in part  to insufficient: financial incentives  training and educational tools and materials  knowledge of community resources for cessation treatments  and time during appointments. Several opportunities were identified to better integrate optometry into tobacco control efforts such as optometrists' access to patients  patients' fear of blindness as a tool to motivate behavior changes  and practitioners' openness to change. Optometrists can be a helpful addition to a smoking cessation healthcare network that already involves more than a dozen health care professions including medicine  nursing  pharmacy  dentistry  and dental hygiene. The findings of this study will be used to develop a national survey of Canadian optometrists' practice patterns regarding tobacco use prevention efforts and cessation supports for their patients.
Global Health,,,Indigenous and tribal peoples' health (The Lancet-Lowitja Institute Global Collaboration): a population study. International studies of the health of Indigenous and tribal peoples provide important public health insights. Reliable data are required for the development of policy and health services. Previous studies document poorer outcomes for Indigenous peoples compared with benchmark populations  but have been restricted in their coverage of countries or the range of health indicators. Our objective is to describe the health and social status of Indigenous and tribal peoples relative to benchmark populations from a sample of countries. Collaborators with expertise in Indigenous health data systems were identified for each country. Data were obtained for population  life expectancy at birth  infant mortality  low and high birthweight  maternal mortality  nutritional status  educational attainment  and economic status. Data sources consisted of governmental data  data from non-governmental organisations such as UNICEF  and other research. Absolute and relative differences were calculated. Our data (23 countries  28 populations) provide evidence of poorer health and social outcomes for Indigenous peoples than for non-Indigenous populations. However  this is not uniformly the case  and the size of the rate difference varies. We document poorer outcomes for Indigenous populations for: life expectancy at birth for 16 of 18 populations with a difference greater than 1 year in 15 populations; infant mortality rate for 18 of 19 populations with a rate difference greater than one per 1000 livebirths in 16 populations; maternal mortality in ten populations; low birthweight with the rate difference greater than 2% in three populations; high birthweight with the rate difference greater than 2% in one population; child malnutrition for ten of 16 populations with a difference greater than 10% in five populations; child obesity for eight of 12 populations with a difference greater than 5% in four populations; adult obesity for seven of 13 populations with a difference greater than 10% in four populations; educational attainment for 26 of 27 populations with a difference greater than 1% in 24 populations; and economic status for 15 of 18 populations with a difference greater than 1% in 14 populations. We systematically collated data across a broader sample of countries and indicators than done in previous studies. Taking into account the UN Sustainable Development Goals  we recommend that national governments develop targeted policy responses to Indigenous health  improving access to health services  and Indigenous data within national surveillance systems.

Telemedicine,,,A Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Telemedical and Standard Outpatient Monitoring of Diabetic Foot Ulcers. The role of telemedical monitoring in diabetic foot ulcer care is still uncertain. Our aim was to compare telemedical and standard outpatient monitoring in the care of patients with diabetic foot ulcers in a randomized controlled trial. Of the 736 screened individuals with diabetic foot ulcers  401 met the eligibility criteria and were randomized between October 2010 and November 2014. The per-protocol telemedical monitoring consisted of two consultations in the patient's own home and one consultation at the outpatient clinic. Standard practice consisted of three outpatient clinic visits. The three-visit cycle was repeated until study end point. The study end points were defined as complete ulcer healing  amputation  or death. One hundred ninety-three individuals were randomized to telemedical monitoring and 181 to standard care. Demographics were similar in both groups. A cause-specific Cox proportional hazards model showed no difference in individuals monitored through telemedicine regarding wound healing (hazard ratio 1.11 [95% CI 0.87  1.42]  P = 0.42) or amputation (0.87 [0.54  1.42]  P = 0.59). We found a higher mortality incidence in the telemedical monitoring group compared with the standard outpatient monitoring group (8.68 [6.93  10.88]  P = 0.0001). The findings of no significant difference regarding amputation and healing between telemedical and standard outpatient monitoring seem promising; however  for telemedical monitoring  a higher mortality throws into question the role of telemedicine in monitoring diabetic foot ulcers. Further studies are needed to investigate effects of telemedicine on mortality and other clinical outcomes and to identify patient subgroups that may have a poorer outcome through telemedical monitoring.
General Practice,,,Acute rhinosinusitis (ARS). Diagnosis and treatment of adults in general practice. The idea behind this thesis is to present how ARS and especially acute maxillary sinusitis in adults is diagnosed and treated in general practice. The study extends over many years  beginning with the first survey in 1991. Based on doctors' answers  we then investigated the diagnostic values ​​of the symptoms  signs and examinations which the doctors reported using. All patients over 18 years suspected of acute maxillary sinusitis were included consecutively and only once and  after a clinical examination with the GP  they were offered the opportunity to enter into the prospective study referred to acute CT scan and by changes in the CT  immediately referred to sinus puncture. Both examinations were conducted at Aalborg Hospital. The disease was found most frequently in younger and 2/3 were women. The reason for this gender difference is unknown. We have assessed the diagnostic values of the symptoms  objective findings and investigations ​​using 3 different reference standards: sinus puncture  microbiological diagnosis and CT scan described in three articles. In all examinations  it appeared that the usual signs and symptoms of acute maxillary sinusitis occur almost equally often and with a few exceptions in patients  with and without pus in the sinus cavities. Pain in the sinus cavities occurring in 95% of patients  and only elevated levels of CRP and ESR are significantly and independently associated with pus in the sinus cavities. This finding is surprising  because they are two nonspecific markers. CRP tested by near-patient testing has  within the investigations period  been introduced in general practice  and from 1999 the doctors also get reimbursed for performing the test. We have on this background originally defined a clinical criterion with pain over the sinuses accompanied by elevated values ​​of CRP and/or ESR giving a sensitivity of 0.82  specificity 0.57  ppv 0.68 and npv 0.74. But looking at the ROC curve we suggest that a more clinical relevant diagnose will be based on use of CRP alone  as the test can be made easily and fast while the patient is in the clinic compared to the use of ESR. The disease is over-diagnosed in general practice. In only 53% of patients  who the GP suspected of having acute sinusitis  was there detected pus or mucopus at the sinus puncture  furthermore the patients' statements that they had had sinusitis was significantly negatively associated with current acute maxillary sinusitis. Almost all patients are prescribed topical treatment to the nose in the form of vasoconstrictor  and 50-70% also antibiotics. The most common bacteria that can be isolated are S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. For many years the first drug of choice has been penicillin V  and treatment with penicillin V has followed Scandinavian recommendations. However  the resistance patterns in respect of H. influenzae have changed over the years and if the dominant flora is H. influenzae  then oral penicillin is not sufficient anymore  and should be replaced by amoxicillin with or without clavulanate. It is reported that the MIC of penicillin V is too high  such that oral dosage cannot provide sufficiently high concentrations. However  in daily clinical practice the doctor does not have the possibility to decide whether the infection is caused by either S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae  unless a sinus puncture is performed and it is not considered as a standard procedure. The recommended treatment is therefore starting with penicillin V  and at treatment failure switching to amoxicillin with or without clavulanate. It is well known that URTI's can exacerbate a chronic pulmonary disease - like asthma - in allergic patients  but this influence is also demonstrated as described in article 6 where ARS in adults without any sign of chronic lung disease or allergy is accompanied by a temporary reduction lung function. Future research should focus on the use of CRP in general practice  analysing cost-effectiveness of the use of CRP patient outcome in relation to antibiotic treatment  clarification of ARS as a female disease  and a detailed exploration of the relationship between URTI's and impaired lung function in lung-healthy patients.
General Practice,,,The association between paranasal computerized tomography scans and symptoms and signs in a general practice population with acute maxillary sinusitis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between changes revealed by computerized tomography scan (CT) and symptoms  signs  and bacteriological diagnoses in a general practice population who had been diagnosed with acute maxillary sinusitis (AMS). This study was designed as a prospective cohort study in Danish general practice in cooperation with the otorhinolaryngology and neuroradiology departments at Aalborg County Hospital. One hundred and seventy-four patients  aged 18-65 years  suspected of having AMS were included. The strongest associations were with purulent nasal discharge  preceding upper respiratory tract infection  maxillary toothache and oedema over the maxillary sinuses. Self-reported previous sinusitis was negatively associated with sinus infection. There was a strong association between increasing values of C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate and changes on the CT scan. CT scans contributed only little to the final diagnosis  whereas increased CRP values and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rates were more reliable indicators of inflammation in the sinuses.
Family Practice,,,Symptoms and signs in culture-proven acute maxillary sinusitis in a general practice population. The objective of this study was to assess symptoms and signs in patients with maxillary sinusitis and a bacteriological diagnosis obtained by sinus aspiration or lavage. Designed as a prospective cohort study in general practice  the study included 174 patients  aged 18-65 years  suspected of having acute maxillary sinusitis by their general practitioner. The main outcome measures were the independent association of symptoms  signs  erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)  and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration and confirmed infection with the predominant bacterial pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. The predominant organisms found in patients with acute maxillary sinusitis were S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. Body temperature >38 degrees C and maxillary toothache were significantly associated with the presence of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. Positive bacteriological culture results were significantly associated with increasing ESR and CRP values. None of the symptoms and signs  with the exception of body temperature >38 degrees C and maxillary toothache  were particularly sensitive indicators of the specific aetiology in patients with acute maxillary sinusitis. Elevated ESR and CRP values were significantly associated with positive bacteriological culture results. On the other hand  absence of these symptoms and signs did not exclude the presence of acute maxillary sinusitis.
Family Practice,,,[Diagnosis and treatment in general practice of lower respiratory tract infections in adults]. Lower respiratory tract infections are common in the community. It might be difficult to differentiate between acute bronchitis  exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  and pneumonia. There is no satisfactory way of defining pneumonia by clinical criteria alone. Measurement of C-reactive protein is useful  but the specificity of the test is low  and must be carefully evaluated in comparison with the duration of illness and the clinical picture. The antibiotic management of lower respiratory tract infections must suppress Streptococcus pneumoniae. We therefore recommend that the first drug of choice should be penicillin V.
Obstetrics,,,Comparing hands-on and video training for postpartum hemorrhage management. The objective was to compare two teaching methods for postpartum hemorrhage management: interactive hands-on training and non-interactive video training. In a controlled intervention study at a secondary health care center in Kenya  the two training methods  based on the Advanced Life Support in Obstetrics curriculum  were evaluated utilizing structured observation of a standardized scenario before and after training. Both intervention groups significantly increased in performance scores after receiving hands-on training: 40% (95% CI 29.5-47.0) and video training: 34.5% (95% CI 25.0-42.0); likewise  pass rates improved significantly. No significant differences in performance score or pass rates were found between the two methods. The findings indicate that postpartum hemorrhage management training by mobile media might be just as effective as conventional hands-on training and a feasible way to overcome the outreach gap in sub-Saharan Africa's rural areas  where peripheral health facilities are generally difficult to reach with conventional training programs.
Midwifery,,,Childbirth attendance strategies and their impact on maternal mortality and morbidity in low-income settings: a systematic review. To review quantitative evidence of the effect on maternal health of different childbirth attendance strategies in low-income settings. Systematic review. Studies using quantitative methods  referring to the period 1987-2011  written in English and reporting the impact of childbirth attendance strategies on maternal mortality or morbidity in low-income settings were included. Guidelines developed by the Cochrane collaboration and the Centre for Review and Dissemination  University of York were followed. The included articles were read and sorted by category of strategy that emerged from the reading. The search criteria yielded 29 articles. The following three main categories of strategy emerged: (i) those primarily intended to improve quality of care; (ii) "centrifugal strategies " which sought to bring services to the women; and (iii) "centripetal strategies " which sought to bring the women to the services. Few of the studies had a design that provided strong evidence for the impact of the strategy concerned. The evidence emerging from the studies was difficult to compare  because concepts were not defined in a consistent manner (such as "skilled birth attendance") and many studies examined the impact of a package of interventions without ferreting out the impact of individual components. Yet  some studies described individual aspects with great promise (such as cost  transport  outreach-friendly drugs or targeted training). There is a need for clearer conceptual frameworks  including some which permit assessment of packages of interventions.
Obstetrics,,,Impact of ALSO training on the management of prolonged labor and neonatal care at Kagera Regional Hospital  Tanzania. To evaluate the management of prolonged labor and neonatal care before and after Advanced Life Support in Obstetrics (ALSO) training. Staff involved in childbirth at Kagera Regional Hospital  Tanzania  attended a 2-day ALSO provider course. In this prospective intervention study conducted between July and November 2008  the management and outcomes of 558 deliveries before and 550 after the training were observed. There was no significant difference in the rate of cesarean deliveries owing to prolonged labor  and vacuum delivery was not practiced after the intervention. During prolonged labor  action was delayed for more than 3 hours in half of the cases. The stillbirth rate  Apgar scores  and frequency of neonatal resuscitation did not change significantly. After the intervention  there was a significant increase in newborns given to their mothers within 10 minutes  from 5.6% to 71.5% (RR 12.71; 95% CI  9.04-17.88). There was a significant decrease from 6 to 0 neonatal deaths before discharge among those born with an Apgar score after 1 minute of 4 or more (P=0.03). ALSO training had no effect on the management of prolonged labor. Early contact between newborn and mother was more frequently practiced after ALSO training and the immediate neonatal mortality decreased.
Specialization,,,Gender bias in specialty preferences among Danish medical students: a cross-sectional study. Female medical students tend to prefer person-oriented specialties characterized by close doctor-patient contact and aspects of care. Conversely  male medical students tend to seek towards specialties with elements of autonomy  technology and "action" . Furthermore  female doctors will outnumber male doctors in Denmark by 2017 and this may have implications for the availability of specialized doctors. Data derives from a baseline questionnaire pertaining to a Danish follow-up study. A total of 561 first year medical students enrolled in 2006 and 2007 answered the questionnaire. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to calculate odds ratio estimates of the relationship between gender and specialty preference. Variables measuring self-image were included in the analysis as potential mediators. 47% female and 19% male students pursued personoriented specialties and 46% female and 68% male students pursued technique-oriented specialties. More female students pursued technique-oriented specialties than in 1992. Female students have 69% less probability of choosing a technique-oriented specialty than males. This association is mediated by lack of self-confidence. If specialty preferences are persistent during medical school  the results suggest that we will face more difficulties recruiting males to person-oriented specialties than females to technique-oriented specialties in the future. Furthermore  when addressing students' specialty preferences  we should consider both self confidence and gender. not relevant. not relevant.
Anesthesiology,,,Implementing point-of-care ultrasonography of the heart and lungs in an anesthesia department. Implementation of point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) of the heart and lungs requires image acquisition skills among providers. We aimed to determine the effect of POCUS implementation using a systematic education program on image acquisition skills and subsequent use and barriers in a department of anesthesiology. Twenty-five anesthesiologists underwent a systematic education program in POCUS during the fall of 2012. A POCUS expert evaluated images from baseline and evaluation examinations performed on two healthy individuals as useful or not useful for clinical interpretation. In August 2016  anesthesiologists employed at the department answered a questionnaire regarding the use of POCUS and perceived barriers to its use. The systematic education program increased the proportion of images useful for clinical interpretation from 0.70 (95% CI 0.65-0.75) to 0.98 (95% CI 0.95-0.99). This difference was significant when adjusted for prior cardiac ultrasonography courses  prior clinical cardiac ultrasonography experience  ultrasonography view  and ultrasound model (P < 0.001). After 3.5 years  15/25 (60%) of perioperative medicine providers  22/24 (92%) of intensive care providers  and 21/21 (100%) of pre-hospital care providers used POCUS either routinely  in selected patient groups  or sporadically. Implementation of POCUS by a systematic education program increased image acquisition skills across anesthesiologists employed at the department. POCUS was used in the intensive care setting  the pre-hospital setting  and to a lesser extent in the perioperative setting. Educational strategies for obtaining images under difficult conditions  practical equipment and evidence for effect on patient outcomes are required for full implementation of POCUS.
Nuclear Medicine,,,Sentinel Node in Oral Cancer: The Nuclear Medicine Aspects. A Survey from the Sentinel European Node Trial. Nuclear imaging plays a crucial role in lymphatic mapping of oral cancer. This evaluation represents a subanalysis of the original multicenter SENT trial data set  involving 434 patients with T1-T2  N0  and M0 oral squamous cell carcinoma. The impact of acquisition techniques  tracer injection timing relative to surgery  and causes of false-negative rate were assessed. Three to 24 hours before surgery  all patients received a dose of Tc-nanocolloid (10-175 MBq)  followed by lymphoscintigraphy. According to institutional protocols  all patients underwent preoperative dynamic/static scan and/or SPECT/CT. Lymphoscintigraphy identified 723 lymphatic basins. 1398 sentinel lymph nodes (SNs) were biopsied (3.2 SN per patient; range  1-10). Dynamic scan allowed the differentiation of sentinel nodes from second tier lymph nodes. SPECT/CT allowed more accurate anatomical localization and estimated SN depth more efficiently. After pathological examination  9.9% of the SN excised (138 of 1398 SNs) showed metastases. The first neck level (NL) containing SN+ was NL I in 28.6%  NL IIa in 44.8%  NL IIb in 2.8%  NL III in 17.1%  and NL IV in 6.7% of positive patients. Approximately 96% of positive SNs were localized in the first and second lymphatic basin visualized using lymphoscintigraphy. After neck dissection  the SN+ was the only lymph node containing metastasis in approximately 80% of patients. Best results were observed using a dynamic scan in combination with SPECT/CT. A shorter interval between tracer injection  imaging  and surgery resulted in a lower false-negative rate. At least 2 NLs have to be harvested  as this may increase the detection of lymphatic metastases.
Orthognathic Surgery,,,Orthognathic Surgery: Outcome in a Facebook Group. The literature shows that the indications for orthognathic surgery (OS) are often functional problems and unsatisfactory facial esthetics. This study investigated the esthetic outcomes and overall satisfaction following OS. Somatosensory change is a relatively common complication and its influence on the level of satisfaction was studied. The social-networking web site Facebook was used to identify the study population. An online questionnaire was performed using the website SurveyMonkey. In all  105 (9%) respondents from the Danish Facebook group about OS  called Kaebeoperation (jaw surgery)  were enrolled in the study. The respondents consisted of 12 men and 93 women  with a mean age of 27 ± 9 years. Fifty-four percent replied that esthetic concerns were the reason for the OS. Eighty-four percent reported improvement in facial esthetics after the OS. Men indicated a higher degree of improvement in beauty than women (P = 0.030). Sixty-four percent replied that their attractiveness had been increased after OS. Eighty-six percent were happy with the results and 89% would recommend the surgery to others in need. No significant differences in esthetic results and satisfaction were seen with regard to sex  age  and somatosensory change. High satisfaction and improvement in facial esthetic after OS were seen. Young patients (16-25 years) and men indicated a higher degree of satisfaction than old (>25 years) patients and women. The use of social media seems to be an interesting platform for qualitative scientific research in certain age groups. Further prospective and objective studies about the esthetic improvement after OS should be performed.
Internal Medicine,Orthopedics,,Detection of Patients at High Risk of Medication Errors: Development and Validation of an Algorithm. Medication errors (MEs) are preventable and can result in patient harm and increased expenses in the healthcare system in terms of hospitalization  prolonged hospitalizations and even death. We aimed to develop a screening tool to detect acutely admitted patients at low or high risk of MEs comprised by items found by literature search and the use of theoretical weighting. Predictive variables used for the development of the risk score were found by the literature search. Three retrospective patient populations and one prospective pilot population were used for modelling. The final risk score was evaluated for precision by the use of sensitivity  specificity and area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curves. The variables used in the final risk score were reduced renal function  the total number of drugs and the risk of individual drugs to cause harm and drug-drug interactions. We found a risk score in the prospective population with an area under the ROC curve of 0.76. The final risk score was found to be quite robust as it showed an area under the ROC curve of 0.87 in a recent patient population  0.74 in a population of internal medicine and 0.66 in an orthopaedic population. We developed a simple and robust score  MERIS  with the ability to detect patients and divide them according to low and high risk of MEs in a general population admitted at acute admissions unit. The accuracy of the risk score was at least as good as other models reported using multiple regression analysis.
Forensic Toxicology,,,A fatal poisoning involving 25C-NBOMe. This paper reports on a fatal overdose case involving the potent hallucinogenic drug 25C-NBOMe (2-(4-chloro-2 5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-[(2-methoxyphenyl)methyl]ethanamine). In the present case  a young male was hospitalized after the recreational use of this potent drug. He died at the hospital at approximately 12h after ingestion  with preceding signs of serotonin toxicity. Medico-legal autopsy was performed on the deceased  during which time peripheral whole blood  urine  vitreous humor  liver and gastric content samples were submitted for toxicological examination. Further  whole blood collected at the hospital at 2-4h following ingestion of the drug was analyzed. 25C-NBOMe and a demethylated and glucuronidated metabolite of 25C-NBOMe were identified in the urine and blood samples using ultra-performance liquid chromatography with high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRTOF-MS). Subsequently  25C-NBOMe was quantified in the peripheral whole blood (0.60μg/kg)  urine (2.93μg/kg)  vitreous humor (0.33μg/kg)  liver (0.82μg/kg) and gastric content (0.32μg total) samples collected during autopsy and in the ante-mortem whole blood (0.81μg/kg) by ultra-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The autopsy findings were consistent with acute poisoning. Based on the toxicological findings  the cause of death was determined to be a fatal overdose of 25C-NBOMe in combination with amphetamine intake. To our knowledge  the present paper reports the first quantification of 25C-NBOMe in biological specimens from a fatal intoxication case.
Hematology,,,Hematological clozapine monitoring with a point-of-care device: a randomized cross-over trial. Clozapine remains the drug of choice for patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia  who show a response rate of about 50% despite their unresponsiveness to other antipsychotics. Although treatment with clozapine can lead to considerable savings on bed days  the drug is underutilized for several reasons  perhaps most importantly because of the mandatory hematological monitoring. The Chempaq Express Blood Counter (Chempaq XBC) is a point-of-care device providing counts of white blood cells (WBC) and granulocytes based on a capillary blood sampling. A randomized cross-over trial design was used comparing capillary blood sampling using a point-of-care device with traditional venous blood sampling. Patients were randomized to two sequences starting with either capillary or venous blood sampling followed by a repeated sequence. Primary outcome was measured on a 10-cm visual analog scale. Eighty-five patients were included in the test. Eight (9.4%) dropped out before completion. Patients indicated that they found capillary blood monitoring less painful than venous sampling (VAS ratings: 0.55 cm 25-75 percentiles: 0.1-1.4 cm vs. 1.75 cm 25-75 percentiles: 0.7-2.6  p<0.001). They also felt less inconvenienced by the point-of-care method than the traditional blood sampling  which involved traveling to the laboratory clinical (0.3 cm 25-75 percentiles: 0.05-0.7 vs. 2.3 cm 25-75 percentiles: 0.75-4.5  p<0.001). For hematological monitoring of clozapine patients a point-of-care device based on capillary blood sampling is better tolerated than traditional venous blood sampling.
Hematology,,,Reference intervals for mean platelet volume and immature platelet fraction determined on a sysmex XE5000 hematology analyzer. New parameters describing the platelet population of the blood are mean platelet volume (MPV)  which is a crude estimate of thrombocyte reactivity  and immature platelet fraction (IPF)  which reflects megakaryopoietic activity. This study aimed to define reference intervals for MPV and IPF and to investigate whether separate reference intervals according to smoking status  age or sex are necessary. Blood samples were obtained from subjects participating in The Danish General Suburban Population Study. MPV and IPF measurements were performed by the use of the Sysmex XE-5000 hematology analyzer. Reference intervals were established by a non-parametric method. In total  1674 apparently healthy individuals (910 females and 764 males) were included. No significant age  sex or smoking status difference was observed. The reference interval was 9.6-13.1 fL for MPV and 1.3-9.0% for IPF  respectively. We have generated reference intervals for MPV and IPF in a large  adult Danish population and found those parameters remarkably stable across age  sex and smoking status.
Family Practice,,,[Knowledge and therapeutic preferences in the treatment of hand eczema in general practice]. The aim of the present study was to assess knowledge and therapeutic preferences in the treatment of patients suffering from hand eczema in general practice. A questionnaire was mailed to 700 Danish general physicians. Based on the case report of a man suffering from contact eczema on the hands and forearms for 4 months  the general physicians were asked to make a diagnosis  prescribe medication  advise the patient about general skin protection and consider a referral to a dermatologist. 451 (64%) completed the questionnaire. The diagnosis contact eczema was made by almost all respondents (98%). A more potent topical steroid was the most frequently prescribed medication  alternatively in combination with an antibiotic component. A subgroup (16%) wanted to prescribe a less potent topical steroid. Only 20% of the respondents wanted to refer the patient to a dermatologist at the first consultation. Danish general physicians recognise the symptoms of contact eczema. The medical treatment is predominantly in agreement with general recommendations. A minor group would choose a less potent medication which could result in an inferior treatment. Attention should be paid to the fact that patients suffering from contact eczema which lasts more than one month ought to be referred to a dermatologist.
Rehabilitation,,,Seroma indicates increased risk of lymphedema following breast cancer treatment: A retrospective cohort study. Lymphedema is one of the most serious complications following breast cancer treatment. While many risk factors are well described the role of seroma formation has recently produced mixed results. Therefore  we aimed to evaluate if seroma is a risk factor for development of lymphedema in one of the largest retrospective cohort studies. We included all patients with unilateral breast cancer treated in the period of 2008-2014. Data regarding treatment and breast cancer characteristics were retrieved from the national breast cancer registry. Data regarding lymphedema treatment and seroma aspirations were retrieved from local treatment codes. In total 1822 patients were included of which 291 developed lymphedema. Multivariate cox regression analysis showed that seroma was an independent risk factor (HR 1.92 CI 1.30-2.85  p= 0.001). Other independent risk factors were lymphadenectomy  radiation therapy  chemotherapy  BMI above 30  total lymph nodes removed above 15 and higher number of metastatic lymph nodes. Postoperative seroma doubles the risk of developing lymphedema. Future studies should examine if seroma reducing measures will lead to lower risk of lymphedema.

Family Practice,,,[Are the Danish Society of General Practitioners' clinical guidelines concerning "Identification and investigation of dementia and dementia-like conditions" useful as the basis of dementia investigation in general practice?]. During the last five years better possibilities have appeared for investigation and medical treatment of dementia. Society and the national health authorities have a growing demand for systematical identification of dementia. In 1999  DSAM published a clinical guideline for identifying dementia. The aim of the study was to test the usefulness of that guideline. A total of 22 out of 29 general practitioners (GPs) agreed to use the guidelines of the Danish Society of General Practitioners (DSAM) and the questionnaires from three consultations in order to systematically identify dementia. At the same time  the GPs gave their opinion about the usefulness of the guidelines. A total of 22 GPs sent results from 69 patients. A group of 49 patients had been CT-scanned  13 patients had been examined by neuropsychologists  and nine patients had started acetylcholinesterase inhibitor treatment. Some GPs found it embarrassing to offer dementia identifying to their patients. Identifying dementia was complicated and time-consuming. Identifying dementia offered opportunities to look further into polypharmacy and cooperation with other health sectors. Necessary but not sufficient preconditions for starting identifying dementia in general practice will be fees  direct admission to CT-scanning and neuropsychologist  and possibly right to prescribe acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. The conclusion was that all GPs found the guidelines of DSAM useful for identifying dementia in general practice.
Geriatric Nursing,,,[Geriatric home visits can prevent hospitalisation of subacute patients but is time-consuming. A randomised study]. To study if geriatric home visits could prevent hospital admittance of geriatric patients referred subacute by general practitioners. Patients were randomised to first contact by geriatric home visit (n=59)  or to subacute admittance to a geriatric ward (n=43)  median age 79.0 and 82.5 years  women 64% and 72%  Barthel-index 755 and 770 and MMSE 24 0 and 23 0. Only 30% of the total number of subacute referred patients were included. 53% (31/59) randomised to home visits were not admitted to hospital  17% (10/59) were admitted at the first home visit and 12% (7/59) within the first 7 days. Patients admitted within the first 7 days were more often single  84% (n=16/19) as compared to 52% (16/31) of those not admitted. The time used on home visits was on average 122 min  including 23 min (19%) for transportation. Among the 43 patients randomised to subacute admittance 16% (7/43) were sent home within 24 hours  and of these 73% were seen in the outpatient clinic  26% (11/42) were sent home on day 2-7 and of these 27% were seen in the outpatient clinic. The overall median time in contact with the geriatric department was 27.1 days (n=59) in the home visit group and 15.0 days (n=43) in the admitted group (p<0.05). There were no significant differences in patient satisfaction or self-rated health. The average time used by the municipality for home service was reduced to 15 min/day in patients sent to hospital (p<0.01) and increased to 44 min/day in patients not admitted (p<0.05). Hospital admittance was avoided by geriatric home visits. However  time consumption was high. The municipality costs increased for non-admitted patients. The overall time in contact with the geriatric department was shortest for admitted patients.
Geriatric Nursing,,,[Primary visitation of elective referred geriatric patients--a randomised study of home visits compared to day hospital visits]. To compare the treatment  patient satisfaction  life quality and costs of elective referred patients seen by a geriatric team at home or in a geriatric day hospital. Elective patients were randomised to primary contact by home visit (n=175) or to primary contact in the day hospital (n=176)  median age 81 and 83 years  median Barthel - index 85 and 85  MMSE 25 and 25. 61% of elective referrals were randomised. There were no differences between the two groups' number of problems regarding referrals  treatment offered  number of blood tests  number of X-rays  number of outpatient contacts  number of admissions to hospital wards or number of diagnosis. The patient had to invest on average 99.5 min together with the geriatric team at the first visit at home and 57.7 min on following visits. The patient had to invest more time if seen in the day hospital: 159.0 min. at the first visit and 120 min. at the following visits. Despite this difference in time-consumption  no differences were found in patient satisfaction or life quality. Of the overall time used by the geriatric team for home visits 20% was used for transportation at the first visit and 30% at the following visits. On average the hospital costs were 3.50 hours/activity at home visits as compared to 1.55 hours/activity in the day hospital. Geriatric home visits are expensive and time-consuming.
Pharmacology  Clinical,,,Merck fellowships contribute to the continued growth of clinical pharmacology in Sweden. Since 1990  Merck  Sharpe & Dohme  Sweden  has created fellowships for physicians embarking upon a career in clinical pharmacology at Swedish medical schools. The fellowship has provided full salary at the level of a resident in clinical medicine for an average period of 1-2 years. Between 1992 and 2004  22 fellows representing all six medical schools were selected for a fellowship. Of these  20 have received specialties in clinical pharmacology  11 now (2006) have positions as physicians in clinical pharmacology in university hospitals  7 in the pharmaceutical industry  and 2 in a drug control agency. Two have not yet completed their training. The fellowships have been granted on the basis of excellence in clinical pharmacological problem-oriented research. The peer review of the applications has been performed by academic professors in clinical pharmacology and the chairperson of the Swedish Society of Clinical Pharmacology. The importance of having a donor with serious dedication to training and research and a scholarship organization that can prioritize these goals in an unbiased way are underlined. The Swedish MSD fellowships are a valuable complement to the resources provided by society to support the development of clinical pharmacology  i.e. the health care organizations  the faculties in medicine  and various research foundations.
Internal Medicine,,,[Benzodiazepines and cyclopyrrolones prior to  during and after hospital admission]. The aim was to describe the prescription patterns of benzodiazepines (BZD) and cyclopyrrolones (Z-drugs) in a population of medical and surgical patients prior to  during and after hospital admission. Data were collected from medical records  the physicians' order entry system and the national electronic pharmacy registry. Overall  38% of the 135 included patients did not receive BZD/Z-drugs at any time. A total of 30% were pre-admission users. While in hospital  50% were users and 17% were users at discharge and 30% during the six months follow-up period (p < 0.0001). Changes in the usage pattern were mainly due to a significant increase in Z-drug use during hospital admission combined with a decrease in BZD and Z-drug use at discharge. During hospitalisation  40% of the 94 pre-admission non-users of BZD/Z-drugs received BZD/Z-drugs. At the time of discharge  61% of pre-admission users had become non-users  and 8.5% of the non-users had become users. Over the 6-month post-discharge period  29 patients (21%) received >or= 3 prescriptions for BZD/Z-drugs (chronic users) compared with 21 (16%) before admission. Medical and surgical hospitalized patients are frequently treated with Z-drugs and BZDs prior to  during and after hospital admission. The usage pattern changes significantly during hospital admission  with more prescriptions for Z-drugs being issued.
Family Practice,,,[Patient information leaflets seen through the eyes of patients in a general practice]. The objective was to investigate patients' perception of patient information leaflets  including their readability  comprehensibility and their impact on adherence. A 14-item questionnaire was prepared and answered by unselected patients in a general practice in Copenhagen. A total of 111 patients were included. Eighty-eight patients (79%) always or often read the patient information leaflets. Among these  77% attached importance to adverse effects. A mere 13% attached importance to all leaflet information. In all  21% never or rarely read patient information leaflets  but relied on the doctor or the pharmacist. 62% of the interviewed had no problems reading or understanding the patient information leaflets. Among the 38% with reading problems  57% had difficulties due to text-size  and 33% found the written language difficult to understand. Thirty-five patients (32%) stated that they had stopped taking medication due to the information about adverse effects. The patient information leaflet is an important source of drug information as most patients read the leaflet and nearly a third of the patients stated that information about the adverse effects had made them stop taking their medicine. Future studies should bring into focus the reason for medication adherence  how written information can be made easier to read  comprehensive and correct without contributing to anxiety and non-adherence.
Community Health Nursing,General Practice,,[Uncertain efficiency of follow-up home visits among older patients after hospital discharge]. Improving the vulnerable hospital discharge process among older people has been in focus for decades. The economic impact and ease of measurement of all-cause hospital readmission rates have questioned whether they are reducible. This review aimed to identify the efficiency of follow-up home visits after hospital discharge by district nurses in coordination with general practice. Six settings in Denmark have been evaluated in different controlled designs. Results are inconsistent and inconclusive due to selection bias and methods chosen. Targeting and management organisation need further research.
Epidemiology,,,Childhood socioeconomic position  young adult intelligence and fillings of prescribed medicine for prevention of cardiovascular disease in middle-aged men. To explore the relationship between childhood socioeconomic position (SEP) and filling of medicine prescriptions for prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)  with young adult intelligence (IQ) as a potential mediator. Birth cohort study with logistic and Cox-proportional hazard regression analyses of associations between childhood SEP  retrieved from birth certificates  and prevalence  initiation of and refill persistency for CVD preventive medicine. Denmark. 8736 Danish men born in 1953  who had no CVD at the start of follow-up in 1995  were followed in the Danish National Prescription Register for initiation of and refill persistency for antihypertensives and statins  until the end of 2007 (age 54 years). Low childhood SEP at age 18 was not associated with prescription fillings of antihypertensives  but was weakly associated with initiation of statins (HR = 1.19 (95% CI 1.00 to1.42)). This estimate was attenuated when IQ was entered into the model (HR=1.10 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.23)). Low childhood SEP was also associated with decreased refill persistency for statins (HR=2.23 (95% CI 1.13 to 4.40)). Thus  the HR for SEP only changed slightly (HR=2.24 (95% CI 1.11 to 4.52)) when IQ was entered into the model  but entering other covariates (education and body mass index in young adulthood and income in midlife) into the model attenuated the HR to 2.04 (95% CI 1.00 to 4.16). Low childhood SEP was related to more frequent initiation of and poorer refill persistency for statins. IQ in young adulthood explained most of the association between childhood SEP and initiation of statins  but had no impact on refill persistency.
Community Health Nursing,Geriatric Nursing,,Collaborative relationship in preventive home visits to older people. To describe what characterizes preventive home visits with collaborative relationships among non-disabled home-dwelling older people in Japan. Preventive home visits have the potential to result in improved health outcomes among older people. Collaboration  mutual understanding and trust between visitor and the visited person seem to work as a vehicle  but little is known about which part of the encounters contributes to a collaborative relationship. We performed a retrospective qualitative analysis of visiting records written by preventive home visitors immediately after the visits were made. A collaborative relationship was predefined as a favourable change in behaviour seen in the visited person during the study period. Visitor characteristics were analysed from 248 records where 37 cases of collaborative relationships were documented. The three most important elements associated with a collaborative relationship were (i) visitor communication skills i.e. mastering 'enhancing motivation' and 'having patience and coping with frustrations' in difficult and problematic situations  (ii) professionalism  which includes 'professional instruction and guidance' based on documented knowledge in health and social domains combined with an overall 'caring approach' and (iii) practical actions which imply an 'immediate concrete response to identified needs or problems' and 'individually tailored advice' to suit the older person's daily life. Preventive home visitor communication skills and professionalism  and practical actions after the visits characterized cases  where favourable changes in behaviour were obtained in non-disabled home-dwelling older people in Japan. Education should be emphasized  because preventive home visitor competence may be the most important element of proactive assessment schemes to obtain beneficial outcomes.
Global Health,,,[Climate change and consequences for the elderly]. Heat waves may cause increased mortality  especially among frail elderly. The consequences of heat waves can be prevented by reducing indoor temperature  increasing intake of water with relevant electrolytes and ongoing assessment of medication and chronic disease. The regional and municipal administrative bodies should create management plans for heat waves and other extreme weather situations.
Community Health Nursing,Family Practice,Geriatrics,Feasible model for prevention of functional decline in older people: municipality-randomized  controlled trial. To investigate the effect of an educational program for preventive healthcare professionals in routine primary care on functional ability  nursing home admissions  and mortality in older adults. A prospective  controlled 3-year follow-up study (1999-2001) in primary care with randomization and intervention at the municipality level and outcomes measured at the individual level in two age cohorts. Primary care. Of 81 eligible municipalities in four counties  34 agreed to participate. A total study population of 5 788 home-dwelling subjects aged 75 and 80 were asked to participate. Written consent was obtained from 4 060 persons (70.1%)  of whom 2 104 were living in 17 intervention municipalities and 1 956 were living in 17 matched control municipalities. Intervention municipality visitors received ongoing education  and local general practitioners were introduced to a short geriatric assessment program early in the study period. Control municipalities visitors and general practitioners received no education. At the 3-year follow-up  the outcome measures of mortality and nursing home admissions were obtained from all  and the outcome measure of functional ability was obtained from 3 383 (95.6%) of 3 540 surviving participants. Education improved functional ability (odds ratio=1.20  95% confidence interval (CI)=1.01-1.42  P=.04) in intervention municipality participants  notably in the 80-year-olds. There were no differences in mortality (relative risk (RR)=1.06  95% CI=0.87-1.28  P=.59) or rates of nursing home admissions after 3 years (RR=0.74  95% CI=0.50-1.09  P=.13). Subjects aged 80 benefited from accepting and receiving in-home assessment with regular follow-ups. A brief  feasible educational program for primary care professionals helps preserve older people's functional ability.
Dermatology,Internal Medicine,Ophthalmology,An adverse drug event manager facilitates spontaneous reporting of adverse drug reactions. Spontaneous reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) is used for continuous risk-benefit evaluation of marketed pharmaceutical products and for signal detection. The Adverse Drug Event Manager (ADEM) is a service offered to clinicians employed at hospitals in the Capital Region of Denmark. The ADEM assists healthcare professionals in reporting suspected ADRs to the Danish Health Authority. The aim of this retrospective observational study was to quantify and describe ADRs reported via the ADEM in 2014. All ADR reports handled by the ADEM in 2014 were recorded anonymously and analysed descriptively. A total of 484 ADRs were reported through the ADEM in 2014 (the median number of reports per month was 37; range: 17-78). The majority of the reports came from departments of internal medicine (61%)  psychiatry (14%) and dermatology  ophthalmology or otorhinolaryngology (11%). The drugs most frequently reported were lisdexamphetamine (n = 40)  rivaroxaban (n = 16) and warfarin (n = 15) (vaccines excluded). In 13 out of 484 reports  the ADR was associated with a fatal outcome. The findings of this study indicate that an ADEM promotes and facilitates spontaneous ADR reporting and helps raise awareness about ADRs  including how and why they should be reported. Hopefully  this will assist national and European spontaneous reporting systems in their work to increase patient safety nationally and abroad. none. not relevant. .
General Practice,,,Early detection of COPD in primary care: the Copenhagen COPD screening project. To evaluate the effectiveness of a screening programme for COPD in primary care. Subjects aged 65 years or older registered with a general practitioner in Copenhagen were asked to complete a questionnaire on smoking status and symptoms of COPD. If they were smokers or former smokers or if morning cough with sputum and/or dyspnoea was present  subjects were defined as "at risk of COPD" and were invited to undergo spirometric examination. Of the 7103 subjects who met the study criteria  81.2% responded to the questionnaire. Of these  58.5% were at risk of COPD. Of those at risk  40% underwent a spirometric examination. COPD was classified as mild in 252 (42.3%)  moderate in 258 (43.3%) and severe-very severe in 86 subjects (14.4%). The participation rate was significantly higher among subjects invited for spirometry at a healthcare centre compared to general practice. Our findings suggest that a questionnaire can be used as a screening tool to identify subjects at risk of COPD. Furthermore  the study shows that more than half the subjects aged 65 years and above were at risk of COPD and required clinical assessment. Willingness to undergo spirometric examination depends on the location of the screening.
Geriatric Nursing,,,[Palliative care in non-malignant conditions]. Up until now specialised palliative care has traditionally been offered to patients suffering from cancer. However  the age of our population is increasing and more old and old-old live until they die from one or more chronic non-malignant conditions. Patients dying from e.g. chronic heart failure must at one and the same time receive treatment for the actual deteriorating state of the heart condition as well as pure symptom control. Prognosticating the time of referral to specialist palliative care services is more difficult in non-malignant conditions.
Pharmacogenetics,,,Severe fluoropyrimidine toxicity due to novel and rare DPYD missense mutations  deletion and genomic amplification affecting DPD activity and mRNA splicing. Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) is the initial and rate-limiting enzyme in the catabolism of 5-fluorouracil (5FU). Genetic variations in DPD have emerged as predictive risk factors for severe fluoropyrimidine toxicity. Here  we report novel and rare genetic variants underlying DPD deficiency in 9 cancer patients presenting with severe fluoropyrimidine-associated toxicity. All patients possessed a strongly reduced DPD activity  ranging from 9 to 53% of controls. Analysis of the DPD gene (DPYD) showed the presence of 21 variable sites including 4 novel and 4 very rare aberrations: 3 missense mutations  2 splice-site mutations  1 intronic mutation  a deletion of 21 nucleotides and a genomic amplification of exons 9-12. Two novel/rare variants (c.2843T>C  c.321+1G>A) were present in multiple  unrelated patients. Functional analysis of recombinantly-expressed DPD mutants carrying the p.I948T and p.G284V mutation showed residual DPD activities of 30% and 0.5%  respectively. Analysis of a DPD homology model indicated that the p.I948T and p.G284V mutations may affect electron transfer and the binding of FAD  respectively. cDNA analysis showed that the c.321+1G>A mutation in DPYD leads to skipping of exon 4 immediately upstream of the mutated splice-donor site in the process of DPD pre-mRNA splicing. A lethal toxicity in two DPD patients suggests that fluoropyrimidines combined with other therapies such as radiotherapy might be particularly toxic for DPD deficient patients. Our study advocates a more comprehensive genotyping approach combined with phenotyping strategies for upfront screening for DPD deficiency to ensure the safe administration of fluoropyrimidines.
Pediatrics,,,The Use of Electrochemiluminescence Assays to Predict Autoantibody and Glycemic Progression Toward Type 1 Diabetes in Individuals with Single Autoantibodies. Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assays have shown promise for enhancing the prediction of type 1 diabetes (T1D) with autoantibodies. We thus studied relatives of T1D patients to determine whether ECL assays can be used to refine risk assessments for T1D among individuals either positive for single GADA or single mIAA autoantibodies. TrialNet Pathway to Prevention (PTP) study participants with either GADA or mIAA single autoantibodies were tested for ECL positivity during their participation in the TrialNet PTP study. Those ECL positive (ECL(+)) were compared with those ECL negative (ECL(-)) for conversion to multiple autoantibodies  6-month glycemic progression (PS6M)  and the progression to T1D. The progression to multiple autoantibodies was significantly higher for those GADA/ECL(+) (n = 107) than those GADA/ECL(-) (n = 78) (P = 0.001) and for those mIAA/ECL(+) (n = 24) than those mIAA/ECL(-) (n = 63) (P < 0.001). The hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals were 3.42 (1.58-7.39; P < 0.01) for GADA and 8.15 (3.02-22.00; P < 0.001) for mIAA. GADA/ECL(+) and mIAA/ECL(+) participants had significantly higher PS6M values than their ECL(-) counterparts (P = 0.001 for GADA and P = 0.009 for mIAA). Of those GADA/ECL(+)  14% progressed to T1D; of those mIAA/ECL(+)  17% progressed to T1D. Only 1 individual (positive for GADA) of the 141 who was ECL(-) progressed to T1D (median follow-up: 5 years). ECL measurements appear to have utility for natural history studies and prevention trials of individuals with single autoantibodies. Those ECL(+) are at appreciable risk for developing multiple autoantibodies and for glycemic progression toward T1D  whereas those ECL(-) are at very low risk.
Forensic Pathology,,,The unexpected finding of a benign mature teratoma in a forensic pathology autopsy: a rare cause for sudden  unexpected death. Intracranial teratomas are rare tumors that are usually discovered in infancy due to progressive symptoms. We describe a case of a 38-year-old man who was found dead 9 hours after the last sign of life. The deceased's medical history could not explain the sudden  unexpected death. A forensic autopsy revealed an asymptomatic  mature teratoma in the left frontal and temporal lobes. We concluded that the cause of death must have been a generalized epileptiform seizure originating in the tumor site(s) leading to aspiration of the stomach contents and unfavorable positioning  resulting in asphyxia.
Internal Medicine,,,Junior physician skill and behaviour in resuscitation: a simulation study. Physicians are expected to manage their role as teamleader during resuscitation. During inter-hospital transfer the physician has the highest medical credentials on a small team. The aim of this study was to describe physician behaviour as teamleaders in a simulated cardiac arrest during inter-hospital transfer. Our goal was to pinpoint deficits in knowledge and skill integration and make recommendations for improvements in education. An ambulance was the framework for the simulation; the scenario a patient with acute coronary syndrome suffering ventricular fibrillation during transportation. Physicians (graduation age < or =5 years) working in internal medicine departments in Denmark were studied. The ambulance crew was instructed to be passive to clarify the behaviour of the physicians. 72 physicians were studied. Chest compressions were initiated in 71 cases  ventilation and defibrillation in 72. The median times for arrival of the driver in the patient cabin  initiation of ventilation and chest compressions  and first defibrillation were all less than 1min. Medication was administered in 63/72 simulations (88%)  after a median time of 210 s. Adrenaline was the preferred initial drug administered (58/63  92%). Tasks delegated were ventilations  chest compressions  defibrillation  and administration of medication (97%  92%  42%  and 10% of cases  respectively). Junior physicians performed well with respect to the treatment given and the delegation of tasks. However  variations in the time of initiation it took for each treatment indicated lack of leadership skills. It is imperative that the education of physicians includes training in leadership.
Global Health,,,A characterisation of low-grade inflammation and metabolic complications in HIV-infected patients. HIV-associated lipodystrophy syndrome frequently presents as a relative lack of peripheral adipose tissue storage combined with an increase in visceral fat  associated with insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia. This thesis discusses explanations for the links between abnormalities in glucose metabolism  the steroid synthesis pathway  the growth hormone-insulin growth factor-1 axis  and chronic changes in adipose tissue distribution. Specifically  the mechanisms by which low-grade inflammation may affect the normal stimulatory effect of insulin on glucose and fat storage are reviewed. We propose that both chronic low-grade inflammation from HIV infection and treatment with HAART trigger cellular homeostatic stress responses with adverse effects on glucose metabolism. The physiological outcome is such that the total energy storage in the adipocytes is decreased  and the remaining adipocytes resist further energy storage. The excess circulating and dietary lipid metabolites  normally metabolised by adipose tissue  are deposited ectopically in the muscle  liver  or visceral adipose tissue  where they impair insulin action. This deposition of lipid metabolites leads to a vicious circle of insulin resistance and lipotoxicity leading to lipoatrophy or a mixed-type with increased visceral adipose tissue and a clinical phenotype of HIV-associated lipodystrophy syndrome with an elevated waist-to-hip ratio. This HIV-associated inflamm-ageing syndrome can provide a platform for further studies in HIV-infected patients and act as a model for biological accelerated ageing.
Global Health,,,[Helicobacter pylori resistance]. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is recognized as the causative of several gastroduodenal disorders. The discovery of H. pylori revolutionized the treatment for ulcus pepticum. Antibiotics combined with proton pump inhibitors or bismuth have been effective in the treatment of H. pylori infections  but there is an emerging problem with H. pylori resistance against the most frequently used antibiotics  which substantially impairs the treatment of H. pylori-associated disorders. In this article the focus is on the prevalence of H. pylori resistance  its clinical implications and the molecular mechanisms behind resistance development.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Work environment satisfaction and employee health: panel evidence from Denmark  France and Spain  1994-2001. This paper investigates whether a satisfactory work environment can promote employee health even after controlling for socioeconomic status and life style factors. A dynamic panel model of health is estimated from worker samples from Denmark  France and Spain  employing both self-assessed general health and the presence of a functional limitation. In all three countries and for both types of health measures  a good perceived work environment is found to be a highly significant determinant of worker health even after controlling for unobserved heterogeneity and minimizing reverse causality. The marginal effect is  however  larger in France and Denmark than in Spain. Several potential explanations for this finding are discussed. Further  a satisfactory working environment is found to be at least as important for employee health as socioeconomic status. Thus  investing in giving workers a satisfying work environment could be a low-cost way of improving employee health.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Early administrations of statins after acute coronary syndrome]. In this Cochrane review the potential benefits and harms of early administrations of statins after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) were evaluated in 18 randomized trials including 14 303 patients. No statistically significant effect was found on the primary combined outcome of death  myocardial infarction and stroke  but at four-month follow-up the incidence of unstable angina pectoris was significantly reduced. Despite the lack of evidence for an additional effect of early statin administrations on hard clinical end points  we find good reasons to maintain statins in the early treatment of ACS.
Medicine,Specialization,,[Assessment of physicians' competence. The continuous professional development]. Several stakeholders now request some sort of continuous assessment of physician performance. In the assessment of physicians it must be acknowledged that physicians often work in teams and systems  rendering it impossible to attribute quality of practice to a single person. The challenge is to design a concept that is a meaningful contribution to the development of quality of practice. There is a need to rethink the traditional discourse known from undergraduate and postgraduate specialist educations when applying concepts of assessment to the continuous professional development.
Epidemiology,,,Risk of asthma in heterozygous carriers for cystic fibrosis: A meta-analysis. Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have a higher prevalence of asthma than the background population  however  it is unclear whether heterozygous CF carriers are susceptible to asthma. Given this  a meta-analysis is necessary to determine the veracity of the association of CF heterozygosity with asthma. We screened the medical literature from 1966 to 2015 and performed a meta-analysis to determine the risk of asthma in CF heterozygotes vs. non-carriers. Aggregating data from 15 studies  the odds ratio for asthma in CF heterozygotes compared with non-carriers was significantly elevated at 1.61 (95% CI: 1.18-2.21). When analyzing the studies considered of high quality in which asthma was diagnosed by a physician  the patients were >18years  or study size was ≥500  the trend remained the same  that heterozygous carriers of CF had elevated risk for asthma. The results show that heterozygous carriers for CF have a higher risk of asthma than non-carriers.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Rehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty]. The short- and long-term benefits of post-discharge physiotherapy regimens after total knee arthroplasty are debatable. A national survey including hospitals in Denmark that perform total knee arthroplasty showed a large variability in indication and regimen for post-knee arthroplasty rehabilitation. Since hospital stay duration has decreased considerably  the need for post-discharge physiotherapy may also have changed. Thus  the indication for and types of rehabilitation programmes need to be studied within the context of fast-track knee arthroplasty.
Rheumatology,,,Prognostic factors in lupus nephritis: diagnostic and therapeutic delay increases the risk of terminal renal failure. To evaluate the prognostic significance of clinical and renal biopsy findings in an unselected cohort of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and nephritis. Ninety-one patients with lupus nephritis were included in the study. Renal biopsies were classified according to the WHO criteria and examined for the presence of active and chronic histological changes. Predictors of endstage renal disease (ESRD) were identified by univariate and multivariate analyses. The median followup time was 6.1 years (0.1-30.0 yrs). In all cases  immunosuppressive treatment was initiated or intensified within one month following renal biopsy. The cumulative incidence of ESRD after 1  5  and 10 years was 3.5%  15%  and 17%  respectively. A variety of clinical and biopsy findings including several histological markers of chronic renal damage were identified as univariate predictors of ESRD. In multivariate regression analyses  duration of nephritis symptoms > 6 months prior to biopsy  s-creatinine > 140 micromol/l  diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis  and tubular atrophy emerged as the strongest combination of independent risk factors (relative hazard ratios: 9.3  5.6  8.9  and 3.1  respectively). Our results confirm the negative prognostic impact of hypercreatininemia  class IV histopathology  and tubular atrophy in lupus nephritis. Our data show that delay between onset of nephritis and renal biopsy constitutes an important risk factor of ESRD. Patients with SLE should have kidney biopsy as soon as clinical signs of nephritis are evident in order to accelerate treatment decisions and minimize risk of inflammation-induced irreversible kidney damage.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Perforated peptic ulcer: how to improve outcome? Despite the introduction of histamine H2-receptor antagonists  proton-pump inhibitors and the discovery of Helicobacter pylori  both the incidence of emergency surgery for perforated peptic ulcer and the mortality rate for patients undergoing surgery for peptic ulcer perforation have increased. This increase has occurred despite improvements in perioperative treatment and monitoring. To improve the outcome of these patients  it is necessary to investigate the reasons behind this high mortality rate. In this review we evaluate the existing evidence in order to identify significant risk factors with an emphasis on risks that are preventable. A systematic review including randomized studies was carried out. There are a limited number of studies of patients with peptic ulcer perforation. Most of these studies are of low evident status. Only a few randomized  controlled trials have been published. The mortality rate and the extent of postoperative complications are fairly high but the reasons for this have not been thoroughly explained  even though a number of risk factors have been identified. Some of these risk factors can be explained by the septic state of the patient on admission. In order to improve the outcome of patients with peptic ulcer perforation  sepsis needs to be factored into the existing knowledge and treatment.
Stroke Rehabilitation,,,Follow-up services for stroke survivors after hospital discharge--a randomized control study. To evaluate whether follow-up services for stroke survivors could improve functional outcome and reduce readmission rate. In this paper results of functional outcome are reported. Randomized controlled trial allocating patients to one of three different types of aftercare: (1) follow-up home visits by a physician  (2) physiotherapist instruction in the patient's home  or (3) standard aftercare. Stroke patients with persisting impairment and disability who  after completing inpatient rehabilitation  were discharged to their homes. Six months after discharge  functional outcome was assessed with Functional Quality of Movement  Barthel Index  Frenchay Activity Index and Index of Extended Activites of Daily Living. One-hundred and fifty-five stroke patients were included in the study. Fifty-four received follow-up home visits by a physician  53 were given instructions by a physiotherapist in their home and 48 received standard aftercare only. No statistically significant differences in functional outcome six months after discharge were demonstrated between the three groups. However  all measurements showed a tendency towards higher scores indicating better function in both interventions groups compared with the control group. Follow-up services after stroke may be a way of improving functional outcome. The results of the present study should be evaluated in future trials. More research in this field is needed  especially studies of how to support stroke survivors to resume social and leisure activities.
Global Health,,,Assessing numbers and faces: a prerequisite for improving access to lymphatic filariasis morbidity care. Concerted efforts to eliminate lymphatic filariasis worldwide have registered success; multiple rounds of mass drug administration have led to the interruption of transmission in many previously endemic areas. However  the management of patients with established clinical disease (e.g.  lymphoedema  hydrocoele and acute dermatolymphangioadenitis) has not been addressed sufficiently. Two recent studies from Malawi underscore the need for accurate epidemiological and clinical data  and comprehensive morbidity assessments across various domains of daily life. Addressing these issues will guide the implementation of programmes to improve access to treatment and disability prevention for affected individuals in Malawi and beyond.
Tropical Medicine,,,Persistent digestive disorders in the tropics: causative infectious pathogens and reference diagnostic tests. Persistent digestive disorders account for considerable disease burden in the tropics. Despite advances in understanding acute gastrointestinal infections  important issues concerning epidemiology  diagnosis  treatment and control of most persistent digestive symptomatologies remain to be elucidated. Helminths and intestinal protozoa are considered to play major roles  but the full extent of the aetiologic spectrum is still unclear. We provide an overview of pathogens causing digestive disorders in the tropics and evaluate available reference tests. We searched the literature to identify pathogens that might give rise to persistent diarrhoea  chronic abdominal pain and/or blood in the stool. We reviewed existing laboratory diagnostic methods for each pathogen and stratified them by (i) microscopy; (ii) culture techniques; (iii) immunological tests; and (iv) molecular methods. Pathogen-specific reference tests providing highest diagnostic accuracy are described in greater detail. Over 30 pathogens may cause persistent digestive disorders. Bacteria  viruses and parasites are important aetiologic agents of acute and long-lasting symptomatologies. An integrated approach  consisting of stool culture  microscopy and/or specific immunological techniques for toxin  antigen and antibody detection  is required for accurate diagnosis of bacteria and parasites. Molecular techniques are essential for sensitive diagnosis of many viruses  bacteria and intestinal protozoa  and are increasingly utilised as adjuncts for helminth identification. Diagnosis of the broad spectrum of intestinal pathogens is often cumbersome. There is a need for rapid diagnostic tests that are simple and affordable for resource-constrained settings  so that the management of patients suffering from persistent digestive disorders can be improved.
Global Health,Tropical Medicine,,Neglected tropical diseases: diagnosis  clinical management  treatment and control. Branded in 2005  "neglected tropical diseases" have gained traction in terms of advocacy  interest for research  enhanced funding and political will for their control and eventual elimination. Starting with an initial set of 13 neglected tropical diseases--seven helminth  three bacterial and three protozoal infections--the list considerably expanded to more than 40 diseases that now also includes viral  fungal and ectoparasitic infections. In this review  we provide a comprehensive overview of the neglected tropical diseases  their causative agents and the current geographical distribution  including their importance for the general practitioners seeing returning travellers and migrants in Switzerland. We characterise the most important of the neglected tropical diseases in terms of at-risk population  estimated number of infections  annual mortality rates and global burden  including current knowledge gaps. With an emphasis on neglected tropical diseases due to helminths  protozoa and ectoparasites  we review common diagnostic methods and current recommendations for treatment at the population level and the individual patient  thereby juxtaposing the situation in highly endemic countries on one side  with Switzerland on the other. We highlight the clinical presentation and management of the neglected tropical diseases in general and then elaborate on two examples  strongyloidiasis and leptospirosis. Our review provides a global perspective of neglected tropical diseases and we hope that it will prove useful for the general practitioner and clinician in Switzerland and elsewhere to enhance their suspicion index  differential diagnosis  clinical management and treatment  including referral to specialised clinics and laboratories when need be.
Epidemiology,,,Increased risk of aortic valve stenosis in patients with psoriasis: a nationwide cohort study. Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease including atherosclerosis. The pathogenesis of aortic valve stenosis (AS) also includes an inflammatory component. We therefore investigated the risk of AS in patients with psoriasis compared with the general population in a nationwide cohort. The study comprised the entire Danish population aged ≥18 years followed from 1 January 1997 until diagnosis of AS  31 December 2011  or death. Information on comorbidity  concomitant medication  and socioeconomic status was identified by individual-level linkage of administrative registers. Incidence rates for AS were calculated and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) adjusted for age  gender  calendar year  comorbidity  medications  and socioeconomic status  were estimated in Poisson regression models. A total of 5 107 624 subjects were eligible for analysis. During the study period  we identified 58 747 patients with mild psoriasis and 11 918 patients with severe psoriasis. The overall incidence rates for AS were 8.09  16.07  and 20.08 per 10 000 person-years for the reference population (48 539 cases [mean follow-up 12.3 years])  mild psoriasis (509 cases [mean follow-up 6.2 years])  and severe psoriasis (99 cases [mean follow-up 5.4 years])  respectively. Correspondingly  the fully adjusted IRRs for AS were markedly increased in patients with psoriasis with IRR 1.22 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-1.33) and IRR 1.61 (CI 1.32-1.96) for subjects with mild and severe disease  respectively. In a nationwide cohort  psoriasis was associated with a disease severity-dependent increased risk of AS. The mechanisms underlying this novel finding require further study.
Epidemiology,,,Psoriasis and risk of heart failure: a nationwide cohort study. Psoriasis is a common inflammatory disease that is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease  including myocardial infarction. Heart failure (HF) is independently associated with several cardiovascular risk factors and is a major cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The association between psoriasis and HF is unclear and we therefore investigated the risk of new-onset HF in a nationwide cohort of psoriasis patients compared with the background population. The study included the entire Danish population aged ≥18 years followed from 1 January 1997 until HF  death or 31 December 2011. Information on comorbidity and concomitant medication was identified by individual-level linkage of administrative registers. New-onset HF was defined as first hospital admission for HF. Incidence rates of new-onset HF were calculated and adjusted hazard ratios were estimated by multivariable Cox regression models adjusted for age  gender  comorbidity and cardiovascular medications. A total of 5 485 856 subjects were eligible for analysis. In the study period 66 389 patients with new-onset psoriasis  including 11 242 patients with severe psoriasis  were identified. The overall incidence rates of new-onset HF were 2.82  4.22 and 4.70 per 1000 person-years for the reference population  mild psoriasis and severe psoriasis  respectively. Compared with the reference population  the fully adjusted hazard ratios for new-onset HF were increased in patients with psoriasis with a hazard ratio 1.22 (95% confidence interval 1.16-1.29) and hazard ratio of 1.53 (95% confidence interval 1.34-1.74) for those with mild and severe disease  respectively. In this nationwide cohort  psoriasis was associated with a disease severity-dependent increased risk of new-onset HF.
General Practice,,,The impact of non-responders on health and lifestyle outcomes in an intervention study. A randomized intervention study  "Preventive consultations for 20- to 40-year-old young adults"  investigated whether preventive consultations with a general practitioner could help young adults with multiple psychosocial and lifestyle problems to change health behavior. To optimize the response rate of questionnaires at 1 year post-intervention  the non-responders were reminded by telephone. The aim of this study was to examine potential selection bias induced by non-response by comparing responder and non-responder populations at baseline  and to examine the impact on outcomes by comparing initial respondents to respondents after telephone reminding. Non-responders were compared with primary responders using logistic regression models that included socio-demographic factors  health-related factors  and variables related to the intervention study. In order to describe the impact of including responders after telephone reminding on the intervention's effect on different health  resource  and lifestyle outcomes  we compared results in models including and excluding responders after telephone reminding. Telephone contact raised the response by 10% from 316 (64%) to 364 (74%) among young adults with multiple problems. Being male was the only factor that significantly predicted non-response in the model after adjustment for other variables. The responders after telephone reminding tended to improve health and lifestyle more than the primary responders  but not significantly so. Although the additional responses did not change the estimates of the 1-year effect on health and lifestyle changes  it contributed to increased precision of the results. Even though the population of primary non-responders had to some degree a different composition than the primary responders  inclusion of responders after telephone reminding did not significantly change the estimates for effect at the 1-year follow-up; however  the additional responses increased the precision of the estimates.

Rehabilitation,,,Individualized assessment of post-arthroplasty recovery by actigraphy: a methodology study. Previous studies using actigraphy to monitor recovery after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) have reported activity as maximum and average count/min  but not utilized the full potential of the data by stratifying activity into various intensities or analysed the individual development in activity over time. The aim of this study was to describe a novel methodology using actigraphy data to describe specific activity-intensities potentially affected by surgery and patients with poor rehabilitation trajectories. Actigraphy data from 10 patients scheduled for primary unilateral TKA were recorded preoperatively and for 3 weeks postoperatively. Data were individualized by comparing pre- and post-operative values  and activity intensities stratified by division into 5 percentiles (10th  25th  50th  75th and 90th). Changes in activity were assessed visually and by non-parametric testing. Individualized recovery trajectories were described by the gradient of the regression line of post- versus pre-operative physical activity over the study period. TKA had a negative impact on all activity intensities with gradual improvement towards preoperative values during the study period. The inter-individual variation increased with intensified activity. Identification of individual patients with positive  neutral or negative activity trajectories was possible. The methodology should be considered in future interventional studies to improve rehabilitation strategies.
Precision Medicine,,,Current state of pediatric sarcoma biology and opportunities for future discovery: A report from the sarcoma translational research workshop. Sarcomas are a rare subgroup of pediatric cancers comprised of a variety of bone and soft-tissue tumors. While significant advances have been made in improving outcomes of patients with localized pediatric sarcomas since the addition of systemic chemotherapy to local control many decades ago  outcomes for patients with metastatic and relapsed sarcoma remain poor with few novel therapeutics identified to date. With the advent of new technologies to study cancer genomes  transcriptomes and epigenomes  our understanding of sarcoma biology has improved tremendously in a relatively short period of time. However  much remains to be accomplished in this arena especially with regard to translating all of this new knowledge to the bedside. To this end  a meeting was convened in Philadelphia  PA  on April 18  2015 sponsored by the QuadW foundation  Children's Oncology Group and CureSearch for Children's Cancer that brought together sarcoma clinicians and scientists from North America to review the current state of pediatric sarcoma biology and ongoing/planned genomics based clinical trials in an effort to identify and bridge knowledge gaps that continue to exist at present. At the conclusion of the workshop  three key objectives that would significantly further our understanding of sarcoma were identified and a proposal was put forward to develop an all-encompassing pediatric sarcoma biology protocol that would address these specific needs. This review summarizes the proceedings of the workshop.
Pharmacogenetics,,,Genome-wide pharmacogenetics of antidepressant response in the GENDEP project. The purpose of this study was to identify genetic variants underlying the considerable individual differences in response to antidepressant treatment. The authors performed a genome-wide association analysis of improvement of depression severity with two antidepressant drugs. High-quality Illumina Human610-quad chip genotyping data were available for 706 unrelated participants of European ancestry treated for major depression with escitalopram (N=394) or nortriptyline (N=312) over a 12-week period in the Genome-Based Therapeutic Drugs for Depression (GENDEP) project  a partially randomized open-label pharmacogenetic trial. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in two intergenic regions containing copy number variants on chromosomes 1 and 10 were associated with the outcome of treatment with escitalopram or nortriptyline at suggestive levels of significance and with a high posterior likelihood of true association. Drug-specific analyses revealed a genome-wide significant association between marker rs2500535 in the uronyl 2-sulphotransferase gene and response to nortriptyline. Response to escitalopram was best predicted by a marker in the interleukin-11 (IL11) gene. A set of 72 a priori-selected candidate genes did not show pharmacogenetic associations above a chance level  but an association with response to escitalopram was detected in the interleukin-6 gene  which is a close homologue of IL11. While limited statistical power means that a number of true associations may have been missed  these results suggest that efficacy of antidepressants may be predicted by genetic markers other than traditional candidates. Genome-wide studies  if properly replicated  may thus be important steps in the elucidation of the genetic basis of pharmacological response.
Pharmacogenetics,,,Genetic predictors of response to antidepressants in the GENDEP project. The objective of the Genome-based Therapeutic Drugs for Depression study is to investigate the function of variations in genes encoding key proteins in serotonin  norepinephrine  neurotrophic and glucocorticoid signaling in determining the response to serotonin-reuptake-inhibiting and norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibiting antidepressants. A total of 116 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 10 candidate genes were genotyped in 760 adult patients with moderate-to-severe depression  treated with escitalopram (a serotonin reuptake inhibitor) or nortriptyline (a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) for 12 weeks in an open-label part-randomized multicenter study. The effect of genetic variants on change in depressive symptoms was evaluated using mixed linear models. Several variants in a serotonin receptor gene (HTR2A) predicted response to escitalopram with one marker (rs9316233) explaining 1.1% of variance (P=0.0016). Variants in the norepinephrine transporter gene (SLC6A2) predicted response to nortriptyline  and variants in the glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) predicted response to both antidepressants. Two HTR2A markers remained significant after hypothesis-wide correction for multiple testing. A false discovery rate of 0.106 for the three strongest associations indicated that the multiple findings are unlikely to be false positives. The pattern of associations indicated a degree of specificity with variants in genes encoding proteins in serotonin signaling influencing response to the serotonin-reuptake-inhibiting escitalopram  genes encoding proteins in norepinephrine signaling influencing response to the norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibiting nortriptyline and a common pathway gene influencing response to both antidepressants. The single marker associations explained only a small proportion of variance in response to antidepressants  indicating a need for a multivariate approach to prediction.
Occupational Therapy,,,Vocational training courses as an intervention on change of work practice among immigrant cleaners. The aim of the study was to examine how knowledge and skills from vocational training courses on working techniques modified for immigrant cleaners are applied in practice and to identify factors that influence the implementation. The modifications of the standard course included language support with possibilities for translation and an extension of the duration of the course. The study is a prospective intervention study based on qualitative data. Data were collected as structured interviews and observations were carried out at the workplaces before and after the course. The study population included 31 immigrant cleaners from five different workplaces. Changes were observed in the use of working techniques (i.e.  positioning of hands when using the floor mop). In some cases the use of the taught techniques was incorrect  partial  or only used part of the time. Interactions between individual factors (i.e.  knowledge  awareness  capability  or work orientation) and environmental factors (i.e.  equipment  time  workload  or physical surroundings) influenced the use of the techniques in practice. The course provided the participants with new working techniques through which some were able to reduce work related pain. However  with regard to incorrect and partial use of the working techniques  follow-up and post-training support is recommended.
Rehabilitation,,,Effects of training and weight support on muscle activation in Parkinson's disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of high-intensity locomotor training on knee extensor and flexor muscle activation and adaptability to increased body-weight (BW) support during walking in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Thirteen male patients with idiopathic PD and eight healthy participants were included. The PD patients completed an 8-week training program on a lower-body  positive-pressure treadmill. Knee extensor and flexor muscles activation during steady treadmill walking (3 km/h) were measured before  at the mid-point  and after training. Increasing BW support decreased knee extensor muscle activation (normalization) and increased knee flexor muscle activation (abnormal) in PD patients when compared to healthy participants. Training improved flexor peak muscle activation adaptability to increased (BW) support during walking in PD patients. During walking without BW support shorter knee extensor muscle off-activation time and increased relative peak muscle activation was observed in PD patients and did not improve with 8 weeks of training. In conclusion  patients with PD walked with excessive activation of the knee extensor and flexor muscles when compared to healthy participants. Specialized locomotor training may facilitate adaptive processes related to motor control of walking in PD patients.
Family Practice,,,Training general practitioners in the treatment of functional somatic symptoms: effects on patient health in a cluster-randomised controlled trial (the Functional Illness in Primary Care study). Patients with medically unexplained or functional somatic symptoms (FSS) are prevalent in primary care. In this pragmatic cluster-randomised controlled trial we aimed to test the effect of a training programme (The Extended Reattribution and Management model) for general practitioners (GPs) in the treatment of FSS. 38 participating GPs were randomised to the control group or the training group. The GPs included consecutive 18- to 65-year-old patients presenting during a 3-week period for new health complaints. We assessed a stratified subsample with the psychiatric interview Schedules of Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry. Of 701 patients interviewed  350 fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for any ICD-10 somatoform disorder (SD) and 111 presented FSS without fulfilling these criteria (sub-threshold SD). Patients completed questionnaires at baseline and after 3  12 and 24 months. The questionnaires included assessment of health status (36-item Medical Outcomes Study Short Form; SF-36)  health anxiety (Whiteley-7) and physical symptoms (Symptom Check List-90  somatization subscale). Patients with SD consulting trained GPs improved more on our primary outcome of physical functioning than patients consulting control GPs at the 3-month follow-up (p = 0.004)  but the improvement was not statistically significant at later follow-up. We found no significant differences in improvement between patients with SD and those with sub-threshold SD. Results for other SF-36 subscales  physical symptoms and health anxiety only showed statistically significant differences between the intervention and control groups for patients with SD; patients consulting trained GPs had less improvement in vitality  health anxiety and physical symptoms at 24 months compared with the control group. GP training may accelerate improvement in physical functioning for patients with SD. However  the effect is small and may not be clinically significant.
Family Practice,,,A randomized controlled trial of brief training in the assessment and treatment of somatization in primary care: effects on patient outcome. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of an educational program designed to improve care for somatizing patients in primary care. Evaluation was performed during routine clinical care in a cluster randomized controlled trial. Patients were included consecutively  and those with a high score on rating scales for somatization were selected for follow-up (n=911). Follow-up was conducted 3 months (response rate=0.74) and 12 months (response rate=0.69) after inclusion using questionnaires measuring quality of life (Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form)  disability days (WHO's Disability Assessment Schedule)  somatization (Whiteley-7 and Symptom Checklist Somatic Symptom Scale) and patient satisfaction (European Project on Patient Evaluation of General Practice Care). We analyzed differences from baseline to follow-up and compared these for intervention and control groups. Self-reported health improved in both intervention and control groups during follow-up for patients with a high score for somatization  but changes were small. We could not demonstrate any difference between the control group and the intervention group with regard to our primary outcome 'physical functioning.' Patients in the intervention group tended to be more satisfied at 12-month follow-up than those in the control group  but this difference fell short of statistical significance. Training of primary care physicians showed no statistically significant effect on clinical outcome and showed nonsignificant improvement in patient satisfaction with care for patients with a high score for somatization.
Family Practice,,,The uncertain consultation and patient satisfaction: the impact of patients' illness perceptions and a randomized controlled trial on the training of physicians' communication skills. To identify predictors of patient satisfaction among a range of patient and practitioner variables. In particular  to focus on patients' illness perceptions and the impact of a randomized controlled trial on the training of physicians in general communication skills and how to treat patients presenting with poorly defined illness. A randomized controlled follow-up study conducted in 28 general practices in Aarhus County  Denmark. Half of the physicians were randomized into an educational program on treatment of patients presenting with medically unexplained symptoms (somatization). One thousand seven hundred eighty-five general practice attenders presenting a new health problem completed questionnaires on illness perceptions  physical functioning  and mental distress before the consultation. After the consultation  a questionnaire including relational and communicative domains of patient satisfaction with the current consultation was completed. The physicians completed a questionnaire for each patient on diagnostics and prognostics. Predictors of patient satisfaction were determined by logistic regression. A large number of patient and practitioner variables predicted satisfaction in univariate logistic regression models. Results from a multivariate logistic model showed that the illness perceptions "uncertainty" (patient not knowing what is wrong) and "emotional representations" (the complaint making the patient feel worried  depressed  helpless  afraid  hopeless) predicted dissatisfaction at OR (CI) = 1.8 (1.3-2.4)  p < .001 and OR (CI) = 1.5 (1-2.3)  p = .03 respectively. Trained physicians were associated with dissatisfaction at OR (CI) 0.7 (0.5-1)  p = .06 in the multivariate model. Furthermore  uncertain patients consulting a trained physician were less likely to be dissatisfied OR (CI) = 0.6 (0.3-1)  p = .04. A randomized controlled trial on the training of general practitioners' communication skills improved patient satisfaction. Illness perceptions predict satisfaction. In particular  patients feeling uncertain and negatively emotionally involved in their health problem were more inclined to being dissatisfied with the consultation.
Family Practice,,,[A new  empirically established hypochondriasis diagnosis--secondary publication]. The narrow ICD-10 and DSM-IV definition of hypochondriasis makes it a rarely used diagnosis. Based on a latent class analysis of the symptoms exhibited by 701 patients (ages 18-65) in general practice  a new and more valid hypochondriasis diagnosis was defined in this study. The main symptom is "obsessive rumination about illnesses"  and the patient must also have at least one of five other symptoms. The prevalence was 9.5 for both genders. There was a good agreement between the diagnoses made during the psychiatric interview and the physicians' assessments.
Family Practice,,,Screening for common mental disorders: who will benefit? Results from a randomised clinical trial. Outcomes of studies on mental health screening in primary care are conflicting. A feasible and effective case-finding approach could benefit both GPs and their patients. (1) to examine the effect of using a composite screening questionnaire (SQ) on GPs' recognition and provision of care  and (2) to outline useful strategies for case-finding. 38 GPs in Aarhus County  Denmark  volunteered to participate in this trial. 1785 consecutive patients aged 18-65 years consulting with new health problems were included. Patients were screened before consultation using an SQ including scales for somatisation  anxiety  depression and alcohol abuse. Patients were randomised into one of two groups: 900 questionnaires were disclosed to and scored by GPs  885 were blinded. Number of diagnoses  subjects of conversation  and actions taken were analysed. Additional analyses aimed to identify GP and patient factors that could predict improved outcomes. Overall  disclosure of SQ results increased GPs' recognition of mental disorders by 3.8% [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.5% to 8.0%]  and 6.6% (95% CI 1.2% to 12.0%) for patients screened positive. There was a marked variation in GPs' detection rates  and for GPs with moderate or low recognition rates increases were significant (P = 0.001). Conversation on psychological topics increased by 3.2% (95% CI -0.7% to 7.1%)  and by 7.0% (95% CI 1.8% to 12.3%) for patients screened positive. Rates of planned follow-up consultations increased by 3.9% (95% CI 0.6% to 7.3%) and by 4.9% (95% CI 0.7% to 9.1%) for patients screened positive. GPs' self-reported benefit from screening was related to better outcomes. A range of patient and GP factors suggesting added value from using SQs were identified. GPs' recognition and provision of mental health care can be influenced by the use of composite SQs. Perceived benefit from screening may serve as a useful predictor of better patient management. Pragmatic case-finding approaches need further evaluation.
Family Practice,,,A brief case-finding questionnaire for common mental disorders: the CMDQ. The aim of the study was to validate a new case-finding instrument for common mental disorders (CMDQ). A cross-sectional  stratified  two-phase study was carried out in 28 general practices in Aarhus County  Denmark. 1785 consecutive patients  18-65 years old  consulting 38 GPs with a new health problem participated. Patients were screened before consultation using a one-page screening questionnaire including subscales for somatisation (SCL-SOM and Whiteley-7)  anxiety (SCL-ANX4)  depression (SCL-DEP6) and alcohol abuse (CAGE). A stratified subsample of 701 patients was interviewed using the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN) interview. We tested the external validity of the scales using the SCAN interview as gold standard. All data were analysed using appropriate weighted procedures to control for the two-phase sampling design and non-response bias. Estimates of sensitivity and specificity for relevant ICD-10 diagnoses at theoretical optimal cut-off points on subscales: Depressive disorder: 78/86 (SCL-DEP6); Alcohol abuse or dependence: 78/97 (CAGE); Severe anxiety disorder: 77/85 (SCL-ANX4); Somatisation disorder: 83/56 (SCL-SOM); and 75/52 (Whiteley-7); any mental disorder: 72/72 (SCL-8). At the theoretical optimal cut-off points the CMDQ demonstrated higher diagnostic accuracy than GPs on any diagnosis evaluated. The study results suggest that the CMDQ has excellent external validity for use as a diagnostic aid in primary care settings.
Family Practice,,,The FIP study: a randomised  controlled trial of screening and recognition of psychiatric disorders. Research on questionnaires as screening tools for psychiatric disorders has yielded conflicting results. To examine the effect of a routinely administered questionnaire on recognition of common psychiatric disorders in general practice. Randomised controlled trial. Twenty-eight general practices in Aarhus County  Denmark. Thirty-eight general practitioners (GPs) and 1785 consecutive patients  aged 18-65 years old  presenting with a new health problem  participated. Before consultation  patients were screened using a brief screening questionnaire (SQ) including somatisation  anxiety  depression  and alcohol abuse scales. Patients were randomised to one of two groups: 900 questionnaires were disclosed and scored by the GPs  885 were blinded. A stratified subsample of 701 patients was interviewed after the consultation using a standardised psychiatric research interview (SCAN). Overall the GPs' recognition rates were 14% (95% confidence interval [CI] = -2 to 30) better for depression and 35% (95% CI = 2 to 68) better for alcohol problems when SQs were disclosed. Recognition rates for anxiety improved 8% (95% CI = -9 to 26) overall. In the case of somatoform disorders  disclosure showed no effect overall. Among those with high SQ scores  however  disclosure increased recognition rates on any mental disorder evaluated. This study demonstrated limited usefulness for routine screening for common psychiatric disorders. However  findings suggest that the SQ may be useful for case-finding among a subgroup of patients with high SQ scores.
Naval Medicine,,,Vibration on board and health effects. There is only limited knowledge of the exposure to vibrations of ships' crews and their risk of vibration-induced health effects. Exposure to hand-arm vibrations from the use of vibrating tools at sea does not differ from that in the land-based trades. However  in contrast to most other work places  seafarers are also exposed to vibrations to the feet when standing on vibrating surfaces on board. Anecdotal reports have related the development of "white feet" to local exposure to vibration  e.g. in mining  but this connection has not been investigated in the maritime setting. As known from studies of the health consequences of whole body vibrations in land-transportation  such exposure at sea may affect ships' passengers and crews. While the relation of back disorders to high levels of whole body vibration has been demonstrated among e.g. tractor drivers  there are no reported epidemiological evidence for such relation among seafarers except for fishermen  who  however  are also exposed to additional recognised physical risk factors at work. The assessment and reduction of vibrations by naval architects relates to technical implications of this impact for the ships' construction  but has limited value for the estimation of health risks because they express the vibration intensity differently that it is done in a medical context.
Naval Medicine,,,Hospital contacts for injuries and musculoskeletal diseases among seamen and fishermen: a population-based cohort study. We studied musculoskeletal diseases (MSD) and injuries among fishermen and seamen with focus on low back disorders  carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS)  rotator cuff syndrome and arthrosis. Cohorts of all male Danish seamen (officers and non-officers) and fishermen employed 1994 and 1999 with at least six months employment history were linked to the Occupational Hospitalisation Register. We calculated standardised incidence ratios (SIR) for the two time periods  using rates for the entire Danish workforce as a reference. Among fishermen  we found high SIRs for knee arthrosis  thoraco-lumbar disc disorders  injuries and statistically significant SIRs above 200 were seen for both rotator cuff syndrome and CTS. The SIR was augmented for injuries and reduced for hip arthrosis between the two time periods. The SIRs for injuries and CTS were high for non-officers. A sub-analysis revealed that the highest risk for CTS was found among male non-officers working as deck crew  SIR 233 (95% CI: 166-317) based on 40 cases. Among officers  the SIRs for injuries and MSDs were low. The number of employed Danish fishermen declined with 25% 1994-1999 to 3470. Short-term employments were common. None of the SIRs increased with increasing length of employment. Both fishermen and non-officers have high SIRs for injuries and fishermen also for MSD. Only the SIR for injuries among fishermen was augmented between 1994 and 1999. Our findings suggest an association between the incidence of rotator cuff syndrome and CTS and work within fishery. Long-term cumulative effects of employment were not shown for any of the disease outcomes. Other conditions may play a role.
Naval Medicine,,,Hospital contacts for chronic diseases among danish seafarers and fishermen: a population-based cohort study. Seafarers' and fishermen's working conditions may impact on their lifestyle and health. Standardized hospital contact ratios (SHCRs) were compared in two time periods and the relative risks of hospital contact as a function of employment time were estimated. Cohorts of all Danish seafarers (officers and non-officers) registered by the Danish Maritime Authority (DMA) 1989-98 and fishermen retrieved from a pension registry 1989-98 were linked to the nationwide Occupational Hospitalization Registry (OHR) and followed up for incident diseases in two five-year time periods  from 1 January 1994 and 1 January 1999  respectively  using rates specific for age and calendar time for the entire Danish workforce as a reference. The SHCRs for lung and cardiovascular diseases were high for non-officers. Among male officers  the SHCR for diabetes was high in the 1999 cohort and the SHCR for chronic heart diseases was statistically significantly higher in the 1999 than in the 1994 cohort. For both time periods high SHCR values were found for bronchitis  emphysema  cancer of the lung  alcohol-related liver diseases  and diabetes among male non-officers  and lung cancer among male officers. Among female non-officers  a high SHCR for skin melanomas was seen. Among fishermen high SHCRs for bronchitis  emphysema  lung cancer  and Raynaud's syndrome were found in both cohorts. No duration-response pattern was observed in any of the analyses  which may reflect health- and lifestyle-related selection into the trades or a healthy worker effect. Danish seafarers  especially short-term employees  had an elevated risk of hospitalization for lifestyle-related diseases.
Family Practice,,,The benefits of educational release of hospital-based general practice specialist training registrars into general practice. In Denmark  specialist training for family medicine consists of 2.5 years training in general practice and 2.5 years training in specific hospital departments. The hospital training programme contains mandatory release time (return days) whereby GP trainees leave their hospitals in order to work with patients in their teaching GP surgeries for one day every month. The goals are to develop and maintain a family medicine perspective during the hospital training and to maintain contact with the family medicine environment. In order to explore the benefits of going back to general practice for one day per month during hospital training  we carried out a qualitative study comprising three focus group interviews with trainees and one focus group with trainers. Return days are important for the development of a professional identity and they can ensure the provision of a useful/necessary breathing space in a turbulent education. If properly organised  return days have the potential to strengthen professional competences due to a stronger focus on the family medicine perspective during training. The process strengthens transferability of skills. A focus on better educational management is needed. Trainers' commitment and trainees' ownership of and responsibility for the educational process are prerequisites for success.
Family Practice,,,[Online portfolio registration in medical specialist education--secondary publication]. A questionnaire to GP-trainees concerning the assessment of an online portfolio showed that the portfolio provided focus on learning objectives and strengthened the capacity to monitor progress in competence and organisation of practical training. It stimulated knowledge consolidation and reflection in complex clinical situations. The portfolio notes furthermore provided a good starting point for trainer-trainee discussions. However  the value of the portfolio was experienced heterogeneously. Constraining factors were: lack of time and interest from the trainer  inadequate IT-facilities  missing introduction and lack of personal motivation.
Family Practice,,,[Perspectives on inspector visits in general practice]. General practice has always provided teaching and training in some form or another  and recent years have seen a discussion on an appraisal system based on visits to practices. The educational dimension of general practice has been described in several publications. Training in general practice is highly esteemed. Even so  extant literature pinpoints educational elements that may be improved  especially in the areas of pedagogic competence  organisation and physical environment. Interviews with trainees  trainers  tutors and members of the board of the Danish Association for Family Medicine. Educational appraisal in Danish teaching practices is assumed to have a positive impact on training. One 3-hours visit very 4th year is suggested  with the possibility for early revisits as needed. Two inspectors per visit and a primary focus on pedagogic competence are recommended. Despite good evaluations there is room for improvement of general practice training. Educational appraisal may provide a method for this. It is assumed that appraisal in conjunction with the currently existing activities would strengthen the training in general practice. The format should be practicable and acceptable.
Family Practice,,,Using an online portfolio in postgraduate training. This study describes the introduction of an online portfolio in postgraduate medical training in Family Medicine. An online questionnaire collecting quantitative and qualitative data was sent to 90 GP trainees of whom 65 responded. A phenomenological analysis method was applied to the data. The portfolio supported the trainees' ability to monitor their own clinical progress providing a better focus on learning objectives. It was helpful in the organization of the training programme and in the formation of individual personal knowledge. Reflection was stimulated  especially concerning complex and difficult clinical situations and it was used as a point of departure for trainee-trainer discussions. Trainees preferred an online portfolio to pen and paper. The degree of educational support was experienced differently. Obstacles were lack of time  lack of trainer support  inappropriate IT facilities  lack of proper introduction and lack of personal motivation.
Family Practice,,,[E-mail communication in general practice]. Our aim was to examine how e-mail communication in general practice affects the doctor/patient relationship and doctors' workload. Registration was done of e-mail activity in three Danish GP surgeries over a period of 12 months and focus group interviews with patients and doctors. The practices received 191 e-mails per 1 000 patients per year. The male/female ratio was 0.9 to 1. The average patient age was 47.2 years; the oldest user was 88 years old. Qualitative data were categorized under various headings  such as need  expectations  usability  workload  patient service  the communication part of professionalism  worries and barriers against use. E-mail is a requested and useful communication form between doctors and patients in general practice. But it requires guidance and structured communication. It works best when the doctor and patient know each other. It is being used less than might be expected. The barriers from patients' point of view are lack of knowledge of and access to computers  lack of awareness of the possibility of contacting the physician by e-mail and the absence of a personal invitation for use by the personal physician. It is a matter of concern that patients apparently don't read the recommendations concerning proper use of e-mail communication  even though they are clearly described on the Web site and patients have to click "has been read" to be able to continue.
Family Practice,Telemedicine,,[Telemedicine and general practice--future or present. Telemedicine  a way to strengthen the gatekeeper role?]. Electronic communication and data-processing are by no means a new phenomenon in general practice. The next logical step might be to include telemedicine  i.e. images  sound  video  and other kinds of medical information in the communication process. The potential for applying telemedicine in the adjoining areas between the general practice and the hospitals and patients is reviewed. We assume that an increase in the use of electronic communication and telemedicine will strengthen the central role of general practice. A representative sample of international literature is reviewed. The findings are that patients have no substantial misgivings against the use of telemedicine  but scientific documentation of the influence on the patient-doctor relationship  on the quality and quantity of the medical work  and on the job satisfaction of general practitioners is still not available. We present a number of suggestions regarding the use of electronic communication between the general practitioner and the patient. The importance of providing clear  in-depth information to the patient about the use of medical IT communication is underlined. The aspect of data-security is evaluated  and for lack of precise guidelines from health officials it is our suggestion that the report from the Danish Ministry of Finance regarding data-security in public administration is consulted. As to data-access  doctors and patients should be placed on two different safety-levels. It's suggested that doctors should be equipped with a digital key  whereas patients should use a pin code and their social security number. The use of traditional e-mail is dissuaded when exchanging sensitive  person-related information. The importance of valid evaluation of new IT functions is underlined.
Neurosurgery,,,MRI protocol for in vivo visualization of the Göttingen minipig brain improves targeting in experimental functional neurosurgery. The Göttingen minipig is increasingly used as an animal model in experimental neuroscience as a much needed alternative to non-human primates. Accurate spatial targeting in this species in vivo is challenging  and most clinically available magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols do not provide sufficient spatial resolution for this purpose. Thus  the aim of this study was to develop an in vivo pre-operative MRI protocol allowing direct visualization of individual nuclei of major interest in the minipig brain. Three Göttingen minipigs underwent MRI using an inversion-recovery fast spin-echo sequence that was optimized with regards to the following parameters: inversion time  relaxation time  echo time and spatial and temporal resolution  giving a scan duration acceptable for the tight schedule usually employed in a neurosurgical procedure. The most optimal pulse sequence was applied in 8 Göttingen minipigs and the anatomical structures were identified. High-resolution images with excellent contrast were acquired  presenting negligible geometric distortions. Minor flow artifacts from the large neck vessels generated the most prominent artifact. Determination of coordinates necessary in experimental neurosurgery in the Göttingen minipig was considerably improved with this MRI protocol.
Forensic Medicine,,,Different Nordic facilities for victims of sexual assault: a comparative study. Open multidisciplinary centers were operated in the mid 1990s for victims of sexual assaults in Oslo and Reykjavik. However  in Copenhagen and Helsinki forensic medical examination was only available to victims who reported directly to the police. One of the main aims of this study was to compare the effect of these different service facilities in four Nordic capitals on the victims' frequency to seek help and report sexual assaults to the police. The age and attendance profile of 380 individuals  seeking support after sexual assault  was compared for the four capitals over a period of 1 year. The circumstances and consequences of assault  frequency and time lag of reporting were also compared. Open centers received several times more victims  especially in younger age groups  including more reported cases  when compared with the population at risk than forensic institutes. Victims were seen earlier for examination at forensic institutes that dealt with a more limited spectrum of sexual assaults than the open centers. The proportion of rape was higher amongst victims brought to forensic institutes whereas a higher proportion of victims received at open centers had been exposed to less violent assaults. The frequency of visits was higher at weekends  between 50% and 70% of victims reported consumption of alcohol  and one-third were attacked while sleeping. In the majority of cases only one perpetrator was involved  most often unknown or peripherally known to the victim. Open multidisciplinary centers receive and assist considerably more victims  reporting and not reporting sexual assaults than forensic institutes.
Neurology,Pediatrics,,[Ten practical  theory-based tips for clinical course planners]. A list of practical advice and examples are given based on the literature. E-learning with cliffhanger text-cases can activate prior knowledge  and selected examination skills can be trained with simulated patients. Patient video recordings can be used to train clinical reasoning skills  including pattern recognition and hypothetic-deductive approaches. Interactive approaches  for example  questioning  quizzes or buzz groups imply active involvement and participation. Quizzes and MCQ-testing can provide a formative 'check-up' on learning and point to gaps in understanding for the teachers and the participants. Spacing a course with intervening assignments can enable the transfer of skills to practice.
Forensic Psychiatry,,,Predictors of length of stay in forensic psychiatry: the influence of perceived risk of violence. This study describes the prevalence of adverse events and length of stay in forensic psychiatric patients with and without a restriction order. Detailed clinical and administrative information from medical records and written court decisions was gathered retrospectively from admission until discharge for a Swedish population-based  consecutive cohort of forensic psychiatric patients (n=125). The median length of stay for the whole cohort was 951 days  but patients with a restriction order stayed in hospital almost five times as long as patients without. Restriction orders were related to convictions for violent crime  but not for any other differences in demographic or clinical variables. The majority of the patients (60%) were involved in adverse events (violence  threats  substance abuse  or absconding) at some time during their treatment. Patients with restriction orders were overrepresented in violent and threat events. Previous contact with child and adolescence psychiatric services  current violent index crime  psychotic disorders  a history of substance  and absconding during treatment predicted longer length of stay. Being a parent  high current Global Assessment of Functioning scores  and mood disorders were all significantly related to earlier discharge. In a stepwise Cox regression analysis current violent index crime and absconding remained risk factors for a longer hospital stay  while a diagnosis of mood disorder was significantly related to a shorter length of stay.
Internal Medicine,,,Use of complementary therapy among internal medical inpatients. Prevalence  costs and association with mental disorders and physical diseases. The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of complementary therapy/medicine (CT) use among internal medical inpatients. Furthermore  to examine the association between the use of CT and (a) mental disorders  (b) physical diseases  and (c) use of health care. A total of 294 consecutive medical inpatients were interviewed about their use of CT. A stratified subsample of 157 people was assessed for current mental disorders  using an extensive  standardized  semistructured interview (Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry version 2.1 [SCAN]). Health care use was assessed by use of national patient registers. There were 22.5% CT utilizers. More females than males used CT (P=.033). CT utilization was not associated with age  mental disorders  life-threatening or chronic physical diseases or with use of health care services. The use of CT is common among medical inpatients. More research is needed to understand why a significant proportion of patients seeks CT.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,The Periprocedural Management of Anticoagulation and Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors in Endoscopic Interventions. In Germany  more than half a million persons  most of them elderly  are under long-term treatment with anticoagulants. The approval of new oral anticoagulants and platelet aggregation inhibitors  as well as new data on periprocedural bridging with heparins  have introduced marked complexity to the management of treatment with anticoagulants and platelet aggregation inhibitors for endoscopic interventions in visceral surgery. This review is based on pertinent publications retrieved by a selective literature search in PubMed  as well as on the relevant guidelines. Robust data are available on the management of vitamin K antagonists (VKA) and platelet aggregation inhibitors for endoscopic procedures; on the other hand  the data on the periprocedural management of non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOAC) are still inadequate. Endoscopic procedures that carry a low risk of bleeding can be performed under treatment with anticoagulants or platelet aggregation inhibitors. Before any procedure with a high risk of bleeding (≥ 1.5%) oral anticoagulants of any type and P2Y12 inhibitors should generally be discontinued. Patients in whom VKA are temporarily discontinued for this reason need bridging treatment with heparin only if they are at high risk of thromboembolic events (≥ 10% per year). For patients who are anticoagulated with NOAC  timely discontinuation of the drug depending on renal function is of key importance  and bridging is usually unnecessary. Adequate scientific evidence supports the current recommendations and treatment algorithms for the periprocedural management of oral anticoagulants and platelet aggregation inhibitors in endoscopic procedures. Larger-scale studies are still needed to provide a sound basis for the corresponding recommendations about NOAC.
Telemedicine,,,Telemedicine diabetes consultations are cost-effective  and effects on essential diabetes treatment parameters are similar to conventional treatment: 7-year results from the Svendborg Telemedicine Diabetes Project. The increasing number of patients with diabetes poses a major challenge for the health care system. One instrument to meet these challenges could be the use of telemedicine  which  at the same time  may reduce treatment costs. Since 2005  diabetes patients on the island of Aeroe have been offered expert diabetes care using teleconsultations. This article describes the impact of the telemedicine solution on essential diabetes treatment parameters  patient satisfaction  and cost-effectiveness. Telemedicine consultations were conducted with the patient and nurse specialist placed in a consultation room of Aeroe Hospital in audiovisual contact with the physician situated at the hospital on the mainland. Consultations were supported by an electronic patient record and a Web-based quality-monitoring diabetes database. Inclusion criteria in this retrospective study were at least 6 months of telemedicine diabetes control with a minimum of two visits and two hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values. Results were compared with data from the Danish National Diabetes Registry (DVDD). Data are given in medians. In total  23 type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients  aged 65 (56-74) versus 48 years  diabetes duration 21.0 (10.7-31.3) versus 20.5 years  and 55 type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients  aged 67 (64-70) versus 65 years  diabetes duration 14.0 (10.5-17.5) versus 11.7 years  were included. After teleconsultation  HbA1c in T1DM patients was 8.0% (7.4-8.6%) versus 7.9% [64 (57-71) versus 63 mmol/mol]  not significant  and in T2DM patients was 7.4% (7.1-7.7%) versus 7.6% [57 (54-61) versus 60 mmol/mol]  p < .05. Body mass index  blood pressure  and lipid values were comparable with the DVDD. Patient satisfaction was especially related to the major reduction in transportation time (7 h). Reductions in traveling costs and saved working days were the most important factors in making the telemedicine set-up economically efficient. Telemedicine consultation for remote outpatient diabetes control is feasible  and the interdisciplinary interventions achieved high treatment quality results in essential diabetes treatment parameters. In addition  the telemedicine set-up was associated with improved cost-effectiveness and patient satisfaction.
Pathology,,,The Danish Pathology Register. The National Board of Health  Denmark in 1997 published guidelines for reporting of pathology data and the Danish Pathology Register (DPR) was established. DPR contains patient  pathology  and workload data. All records are subject to error tracing. The DPR covers all pathology data in Denmark. The data is used by the pathologists in the daily diagnostic process. The National Board of Health uses the data in the Danish Cancer Registry and DPR is unique for research as data can be linked to tissue biobanks and clinical databases.
Toxicology,,,Assessment of global DNA methylation in the first trimester fetal tissues exposed to maternal cigarette smoking. Maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of negative health consequences for the exposed child. Epigenetic mechanisms constitute a likely link between the prenatal exposure to maternal cigarette smoking and the increased risk in later life for diverse pathologies. Maternal smoking induces gene-specific DNA methylation alterations as well as global DNA hypermethylation in the term placentas and hypomethylation in the cord blood. Early pregnancy represents a developmental time where the fetal epigenome is remodeled and accordingly can be expected to be highly prone to exposures with an epigenetic impact. We have assessed the influence of maternal cigarette smoking during the first trimester for fetal global DNA methylation. We analyzed the human fetal intestines and livers as well as the placentas from the first trimester pregnancies. Global DNA methylation levels were quantified with ELISA using a methylcytosine antibody as well as with the bisulfite pyrosequencing of surrogate markers for global methylation status  LINE-1  and AluYb8. We identified gender-specific differences in global DNA methylation levels  but no significant DNA methylation changes in exposure responses to the first trimester maternal cigarette smoking. Acknowledging that only examining subsets of global DNA methylation markers and fetal sample availability represents possible limitations for the analyses  our presented results indicate that the first trimester maternal cigarette smoking is not manifested in immediate aberrations of fetal global DNA methylation.
Dermatology,,,Application of stereology to dermatological research. Stereology is a set of mathematical and statistical tools to estimate three-dimensional (3-D) characteristics of objects from regular two-dimensional (2-D) sections. In medicine and biology  it can be used to estimate features such as cell volume  cell membrane surface area  total length of blood vessels per volume tissue and total number of cells. The unbiased quantification of these 3-D features allows for a better understanding of morphology in vivo compared with 2-D methods. This review provides an introduction to the field of stereology with specific emphasis on the application of stereology to dermatological research by supplying a short insight into the theoretical basis behind the technique and presenting previous dermatological studies in which stereology was an integral part. Both the theory supporting stereology and a practical approach in a dermatological setting are reviewed with the aim to provide the reader with the capability to better assess papers employing stereological estimators and to design stereological studies independently.
Telemedicine,,,[Direct referral of patients with ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction to primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Pre-hospital use of telemedicine and risk stratification]. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is recommended for revascularisation of patients with ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) with a duration of symptoms less than 12 hours. Primary PCI is recommended even if the patient is to be transported from a non-invasive hospital to an invasive centre. Normally this transport requires an attending physician. This transport strategy is associated with an increased treatment delay. The aim of this study was to assess pre-hospital tele-transmitted electrocardiogram (tele-ECG) and risk stratification by using a questionnaire in order to assess if selected patients with STEMI can be transported safely to primary PCI without an attending physician. Since January 2005 Fyn Svendborg Hospital has received pre-hospital tele-ECG recorded in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with simultaneous risk stratification by using a questionnaire. Transportable STEMI patients were referred directly to an invasive centre without an attending physician. During a period of 17 months tele-ECGs were recorded from 1 148 patients. 82 patients had STEMI and 71 patients were transported to an invasive centre without an attending physician. In this group  1 case of resuscitated ventricular fibrillation was reported. 11 patients were transported to the nearest hospital: 2 to invasive centres  7 patients were inter-hospital transported with a physician  and transport was not relevant/possible for 2 patients. Pre-hospital tele-ECG and risk stratification can select patients with STEMI and transport them safely to an invasive PCI centre without an attending physician.
Global Health,Public Health,,[Trends in global antibiotic resistance]. Antibiotic resistance is an increasing problem world wide  although in some areas the increase in resistance is slow  as in the Nordic countries. Multiresistant staphylococci  Enterobaceriaceae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis are already causing increased morbidity  mortality and huge costs in health budgets. New effective antibiotics will not be available for the next 10-15 years  since the pharmaceutical industry has lost interest in antibiotics. The major determinant in this field  in order to save the activity of the known antibiotics  is the control of antibiotic use.
Precision Medicine,,,Quantitative myocardial perfusion by O-15-water PET: individualized vs. standardized vascular territories. Reporting of quantitative myocardial blood flow (MBF) is typically performed in standard coronary territories. However  coronary anatomy and myocardial vascular territories vary among individuals  and a coronary artery may erroneously be deemed stenosed or not if territorial demarcation is incorrect. So far  the diagnostic consequences of calculating individually vs. standardly assessed MBF values have not been reported. We examined whether individual reassignment of vascular territories would improve the diagnostic accuracy of MBF with regard to the detection of significant coronary artery disease (CAD). Forty-four patients with suspected CAD were included prospectively and underwent coronary CT-angiography and quantitative MBF assessment with O-15-water PET followed by invasive  quantitative coronary angiography  which served as reference. MBF was calculated in the vascular territories during adenosine stress according to a standardized 17-segment American Heart Association model and an individualized model  using CT-angiography to adjust the coronary territories to their feeding vessels. Individually defined territories deviated from standard territories in 52% of patients. However  MBF in the three coronary territories defined by standard and individualized models did not differ significantly  except in one patient  in whom the MBF of an individualized coronary territory deviated sufficiently as to change the test from a false positive to a true negative result in this particular territory. Disparity between standardized and individualized vascular territories was present in half of the patients  but had little clinical impact. Still  caution should be taken not always to rely on standard territories  as this may at times cause misinterpretation.
Allergy and Immunology,Evidence-Based Medicine,Medicine,[Allergology in Denmark 2006]. Allergic diseases are prominent  possibly life threatening  and a cause of worldwide concern. Evidence-based education of doctors in the specialty of allergology is a prerequisite for correct diagnosis and treatment of patients with allergic diseases. Recently  the specialty of allergology has been abolished in Denmark  without any upgrading of the education of doctors in related specialties. As a consequence  one could fear that allergy expertise will be disappearing. We propose collaboration among experts from related specialties with joint mediation of knowledge through a centre of allergology  common educational programs for doctors in training and physician specialists  and collaboration in regional centres of allergology.
Epidemiology,,,Addictive behaviors related to opioid use for chronic pain: a population-based study. The growing body of research showing increased opioid use in patients with chronic pain coupled with concerns regarding addiction encouraged the development of this population-based study. The goal of the study was to investigate the co-occurrence of indicators of addictive behaviors in patients with chronic non-cancer pain in long-term opioid treatment. The study combined data from the individual-based Danish Health Survey in 2010 and the official Danish health and socio-economic  individual-based registers. From a simple random sample of 25 000 adults (16 years or older) living in Denmark  13 281 individuals were analyzed through multiple logistic regression analyses to assess the association between chronic pain (lasting ≥6 months)  opioid use  health behavior  and body mass index. Six potential addictive behaviors were identified: daily smoking; high alcohol intake; illicit drug use in the past year; obesity; long-term use of benzodiazepines; and long-term use of benzodiazepine-related drugs. At least 2 of the 6 addictive behaviors were observed in 22.6% of the long-term opioid users with chronic pain compared with 11.5% of the non-opioid users with chronic pain and 8.9% of the individuals without chronic pain. Thus  a strong association was demonstrated between long-term opioid use and the clustering of addictive behaviors. An intricate relationship between chronic pain  opioid use  and addictive behaviors was observed in this study  which deserves both clinical attention and further research.
Community Health Nursing,Specialties  Nursing,,Outcomes of follow-up visits to chronic nonmalignant pain patients. Follow-up visits by clinical nurse specialists are beneficial for patients with various chronic conditions. It is unknown whether patients with chronic nonmalignant pain can achieve similar benefit. The aim of this study was to assess outcomes of follow-up visits by clinical nurse specialists to chronic nonmalignant pain patients regarding health-related quality of life (HRQoL)  pain  opioid treatment  quality of sleep  and depression. A total of 102 patients were enrolled in a prospective randomized controlled trial during a 2-year period after discharge from multidisciplinary pain treatment and randomized to intervention or control group. Intervention group patients (n = 52) received home visits every fourth month for 2 years. The findings showed that HRQoL improved generally more in the intervention group. Statistically significant improvements were observed for physical function and bodily pain. Whereas the intervention group maintained the pain level on a visual analog scale  the control group reported more pain. During the observation period  the control group increased dosage of opioids whereas the intervention group maintained stable dosage. No significant effect on quality of life was found. Nurses identified signs of depression in 80% of their patients scoring depression on the simultaneous depression questionnaire  and thereby could refer patients to early treatment. Follow-up visits by clinical nurse specialists appeared to offer positive benefits to patients with chronic nonmalignant pain after discharge from multidisciplinary pain treatment. The intervention improved physical functioning  reduced bodily pain and pain intensity and prevented opioid dosage increase. Most episodes of depression were identified and referred to relevant treatment.
Molecular Epidemiology,,,Genomic characterization of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli from children in Mali. Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) is a cause of epidemic and sporadic diarrhea  yet its role as an enteric pathogen is not fully understood. We characterized 121 EAEC strains isolated in 2008 as part of a case-control study of moderate to severe acute diarrhea among children 0-59 months of age in Bamako  Mali. We applied multiplex polymerase chain reaction and comparative genome hybridization to identify potential virulence factors among the EAEC strains  coupled with classification and regression tree modeling to reveal combinations of factors most strongly associated with illness. The gene encoding the autotransporter protease SepA  originally described in Shigella species  was most strongly associated with diarrhea among the EAEC strains tested (odds ratio  5.6 [95% confidence interval  1.92-16.17]; P = .0006). In addition  we identified 3 gene combinations correlated with diarrhea: (1) a clonal group positive for sepA and a putative hemolysin; (2) a group harboring the EAST-1 enterotoxin and the flagellar type H33 but no other previously identified EAEC virulence factor; and (3) a group carrying several of the typical EAEC virulence genes. Our data suggest that only a subset of EAEC strains are pathogenic in Mali and suggest that sepA may serve as a valuable marker for the most virulent isolates.
Pharmacology  Clinical,,,A national drug related problems database: evaluation of use in practice  reliability and reproducibility. A drug related problems database (DRP-database) was developed on request by clinical pharmacists. The information from the DRP-database has only been used locally e.g. to identify focus areas and to communicate identified DRPs to the hospital wards. Hence the quality of the data at the national level is unknown  which may compromise national analyses for benchmarking and identification of national focus areas. The aim of the study was to evaluate the use in practice  reliability and reproducibility of the DRPs documented in the Danish drug related problems database. Danish hospital pharmacies. Practice use of the DRP-database was explored by an electronic questionnaire distributed to hospital pharmacies  and consisted of questions regarding current and previous use of the DRP-database. The reliability was evaluated by comparing the categorization of 24 cases by clinical pharmacists with categorization performed by the project group. Reproducibility was explored by re-categorization of a sample of existing records in the DRP-database by two project group members individually. Observed proportion of agreement and Fleiss' kappa as measures of inter-rater reliability and reproducibility. The practice use study of 12 hospital pharmacy locations revealed that when implementing the DRP-database  the majority of identified DRPs are documented in the DRP-database  however  some variations throughout the country exist. The interrater reliability study of 34 clinical pharmacists showed high inter-rater reliability with the project group (Fleiss' kappa = 0.79 with 95 % CI (0.70; 0.88))  and the reproducibility study also documented high inter-rater reliability of a sample of 379 records from the DRP-database re-categorized by two project group members (Fleiss' kappa = 0.81 with 95 % CI (0.78; 0.85)). The study showed high reliability and reproducibility of the DRP-database  however  some local variation in the use of the DRP-database throughout the country existed affecting the overall quality. These findings indicate that data in the DRP-database may be pooled  and national analyses may be conducted to explore development areas for common interest.
Precision Medicine,,,The advent of ultrasound-guided ablation techniques in nodular thyroid disease: towards a patient-tailored approach. Surgery is the long-established therapeutic option for benign thyroid nodules  which steadily grow and become symptomatic. The cost of thyroid surgery  the risk of temporary or permanent complications  and the effect on quality of life  however  remain relevant concerns. Therefore  various minimally invasive treatments  directed towards office-based management of symptomatic nodules  without requiring general anaesthesia  and with negligible damage to the skin and cervical tissues  have been proposed during the past two decades. Today  ultrasound-guided percutaneous ethanol injection and thermal ablation with laser or radiofrequency have been thoroughly evaluated  and are accessible procedures in specialized centres. In clinical practice  relapsing thyroid cysts are effectively managed with percutaneous ethanol injection treatment  which should be considered therapy of choice. In solid non-functioning thyroid nodules that grow or become symptomatic  trained operators may safely induce  with a single session of laser ablation treatment or radiofrequency ablation  a 50% volume decrease and  in parallel  improve local symptoms. In contrast  hyperfunctioning nodules remain best treated with radioactive iodine  which results in a better control of hyperthyroidism  also in the long-term  and fewer side-effects. Currently  minimally invasive treatment is also investigated for achieving local control of small size neck recurrences of papillary thyroid carcinoma in patients who are poor candidates for repeat cervical lymph node dissection. This particular use should still be considered experimental.
Pediatrics,Public Health,,Risk factors for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection among children in Greenland. To examine the risk factors for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (MTI) among Greenlandic children for the purpose of identifying those at highest risk of infection. Between 2005 and 2007  1797 Greenlandic schoolchildren in five different areas were tested for MTI with an interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) and a tuberculin skin test (TST). Parents or guardians were surveyed using a standardized self-administered questionnaire to obtain data on crowding in the household  parents' educational level and the child's health status. Demographic data for each child--i.e. parents' place of birth  number of siblings  distance between siblings (next younger and next older)  birth order and mother's age when the child was born--were also extracted from a public registry. Logistic regression was used to check for associations between these variables and MTI  and all results were expressed as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Children were considered to have MTI if they tested positive on both the IGRA assay and the TST. The overall prevalence of MTI was 8.5% (152/1797). MTI was diagnosed in 26.7% of the children with a known TB contact  as opposed to 6.4% of the children without such contact. Overall  the MTI rate was higher among Inuit children (OR:  4.22; 95% CI: 1.55-11.5) and among children born less than one year after the birth of the next older sibling (OR:  2.48; 95% CI: 1.33-4.63). Self-reported TB contact modified the profile to include household crowding and low mother's education. Children who had an older MTI-positive sibling were much more likely to test positive for MTI themselves (OR:  14.2; 95% CI: 5.75-35.0) than children without an infected older sibling. Ethnicity  sibling relations  number of household residents and maternal level of education are factors associated with the risk of TB infection among children in Greenland. The strong household clustering of MTI suggests that family sources of exposure are important.
Global Health,,,[Various strategies for elimination of tuberculosis]. In Denmark the tuberculosis (TB) incidence rates per 100.000 individuals per year have decreased from 162 in the 1920s to 6. Greenland is a highly endemic country for TB with an incidence rate that parallels that of India. Nine per cent of the Greenlandic children are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The global TB burden of disease is levelling off - even showing a small reduction in the estimated annual incidence rates. Drug resistance and HIV co-infection as well as diabetes pose great challenges in achieving the WHO/Stop TB partnership goals set out for 2015 and 2050.
Forensic Medicine,,,The diagnostic value of clinical examination after falanga--a pilot validation study. Medico-legal documentation of alleged exposure to falanga torture warrants a high diagnostic accuracy of the applied clinical tests. The objective of this study was to establish data on the validity of palpatory examination of the footpads and the plantar fascia and to assess the distribution of observations among selected cases and non-cases in a small study sample. Calculated estimates of sensitivity and specificity of the individual diagnostic tests are reported and  in general  did not meet the authority-based criteria of an 80% cut-off point. The observed total number of true tests in this study was 65 %. It is concluded that future studies of the reliability of clinical examination and assessment of the variability of observations among unselected cases and non-cases should be conducted in a larger cross-sectional study population.
Family Practice,,,Extended heart failure clinic follow-up in low-risk patients: a randomized clinical trial (NorthStar). Outpatient follow-up in specialized heart failure clinics (HFCs) is recommended by current guidelines and implemented in most European countries  but the optimal duration of HFC programmes has not been established. Nor is it known whether all or only high-risk patients  e.g. identified by NT-proBNP  might benefit from an extended HFC follow-up. In a multi-centre setting  we randomly assigned 921 clinically stable systolic heart failure (HF) outpatients on optimal medical therapy to undergo either an extended follow-up in the HFC (n = 461) or referral back to their general practitioner (GP) (n = 460). The primary composite endpoint was death or a cardiovascular admission. Secondary endpoints included mortality  an HF admission  quality of life  number of days admitted  and number of admissions. The median age of the patients was 69 years; 23% were females; the median left ventricular ejection fraction was 0.30; and the median NT-proBNP was 801 pg/mL; 89% were in NYHA class I-II. The median follow-up was 2.5 years. Time-to-event did not differ between groups (HFC vs. GP) (HR: 1.17  95% CI: 0.95-1.45  P = 0.149). The two groups did not differ with respect to any of the secondary endpoints at the follow-up (P> 0.05 for all). In high-risk patients identified by NT-proBNP ≥1000 pg/mL  no benefit from HFC follow-up was found (P = 0.721). Irrespective of the level of NT-proBNP stable HF patients on optimal medical therapy do not benefit from long-term follow-up in a specialized HFC in a publicly funded universal access healthcare system. Heart failure patients on optimal medical therapy with mild or moderate symptoms are safely managed by their personal GP. www.Centerwatch.com: 173491 (NorthStar).
Rehabilitation,,,Muscle Strength and Poststroke Hemiplegia: A Systematic Review of Muscle Strength Assessment and Muscle Strength Impairment. To systematically review (1) psychometric properties of criterion isokinetic dynamometry testing of muscle strength in persons with poststroke hemiplegia (PPSH); and (2) literature that compares muscle strength in patients poststroke with that in healthy controls assessed by criterion isokinetic dynamometry. A systematic literature search of 7 databases was performed. Included studies (1) enrolled participants with definite poststroke hemiplegia according to defined criteria; (2) assessed muscle strength or power by criterion isokinetic dynamometry; (3) had undergone peer review; and (4) were available in English or Danish. The psychometric properties of isokinetic dynamometry were reviewed with respect to reliability  validity  and responsiveness. Furthermore  comparisons of strength between paretic  nonparetic  and comparable healthy muscles were reviewed. Twenty studies covering 316 PPSH were included. High intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) inter- and intrasession reliability was reported for isokinetic dynamometry  which was independent of the tested muscle group  contraction mode  and contraction velocity. Slightly higher ICC values were found for the nonparetic extremity. Standard error of the mean (SEM) values showed that a change of 7% to 20% was required for a real group change to take place for most muscle groups  with the knee extensors showing the smallest SEM% values. The muscle strength of paretic muscles showed deficits when compared with both healthy and nonparetic muscles  independent of muscle group  contraction mode  and contraction velocity. Nonparetic muscles only showed minor strength impairments when compared with healthy muscles. Criterion isokinetic dynamometry is a reliable test in persons with stroke  generally showing marked reductions in muscle strength of paretic and  to a lesser degree  nonparetic muscles when compared with healthy controls  independent of muscle group  contraction mode  and contraction velocity.
Epidemiology,,,Self-rated health in women prior to clinical onset of multiple sclerosis: A study within the Danish National Birth Cohort. It has been suggested that onset of multiple sclerosis (MS) is preceded by a clinically silent period of up to 10 years. Examine whether such a period should be associated with poor self-rated health (SRH). Information on SRH before pregnancy was ascertained among 80 848 women participating in the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC) 1996-2002. Women were followed for MS from enrolment in DNBC in the 16th week of pregnancy until 31 December 2011. Associations between SRH and MS were evaluated by means of hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using Cox proportional hazard models. During on average 11.7 years of follow-up  239 women were diagnosed with MS. Overall  neither women with fair (HR = 1.09 (95% CI = 0.83-1.41)  n = 113) nor poor pre-pregnancy SRH (HR = 0.94 (95% CI = 0.47-1.87)  n = 9) were at an increased risk of MS compared with women reporting very good pre-pregnancy SRH. Supplementary analyses showed no significant differences in MS risk in consecutive periods of follow-up. In this first prospective cohort study assessing MS risk as a function of SRH  we found no indication of a long period of poor SRH prior to MS. Our findings based on pregnant women may not necessarily apply to all women.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[There is evidence for the use of cannabinoids for symptomatic treatment of multiple sclerosis]. We identified 16 randomized placebo-controlled trials investigating cannabinoids as symptomatic treatment in multiple sclerosis (MS). There is evidence that nabiximols oromucosal spray may reduce subjective symptoms of spasticity and that dronabinol is effective against neuropathic pain in patients with MS. The existing treatment system in Denmark is in conformity with the existing data and there is not sufficient evidence to modify it.
Psychiatry,,,Patient assessment within the context of healthcare delivery packages: A comparative analysis. Due to an increased focus on productivity and cost-effectiveness  many countries across the world have implemented a variety of tools for standardizing diagnostics and treatment. In Denmark  healthcare delivery packages are increasingly used for assessment of patients. A package is a tool for creating coordination  continuity and efficient pathways; each step is pre-booked  and the package has a well-defined content within a predefined category of diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate how assessment processes took place within the context of healthcare delivery packages. The study used a constructivist Grounded Theory approach. Ethnographic fieldwork was carried out in three specialized units: a mental health unit and two multiple sclerosis clinics in Southern Denmark  which all used assessment packages. Several types of data were sampled through theoretical sampling. Participant observation was conducted for a total of 126h. Formal and informal interviews were conducted with 12 healthcare professionals and 13 patients. Furthermore  audio recordings were made of 9 final consultations between physicians and patients; 193min of recorded consultations all in all. Lastly  the medical records of 13 patients and written information about packages were collected. The comparative  abductive analysis focused on the process of assessment and the work made by all the actors involved. In this paper  we emphasized the work of healthcare professionals. We constructed five interrelated categories: 1. "Standardized assessing"  2. "Flexibility"  which has two sub-categories  2.1. "Diagnostic options" and 2.2. "Time and organization"  and  finally  3. "Resisting the frames". The process of assessment required all participants to perform the predefined work in the specified way at the specified time. Multidisciplinary teamwork was essential for the success of the process. The local organization of the packages influenced the assessment process  most notably the pre-defined scope of relevant diseases targeted by the package. The inflexible frames of the assessment package could cause resistance among clinicians. Moreover  expert knowledge was an important factor for the efficiency of the process. Some types of organizational work processes resulted in many patients being assessed  but without being diagnosed with at package-relevant disease. Limiting the grounds for using specialist knowledge in structured health care delivery may affect specialists' sense of professional autonomy and can result in professionals employing strategies to resist the frames of the packages. Finally  when organizing healthcare delivery packages  it seems important to consider how to make the optimal use of specialist knowledge.
Epidemiology,,,Alcohol consumption and risk of atrial fibrillation: Observational and genetic estimates of association. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that alcohol consumption  both observational (self-reported) and estimated by genetic instruments  is associated with a risk of atrial fibrillation and to determine whether people with high cardiovascular risk are more sensitive towards alcohol than people with low risk. We used data for a total of 88 782 men and women from the Copenhagen City Heart Study 1991-1994 and 2001-2003 and the Copenhagen General Population Study 2003-2010. Information on incident cases of atrial fibrillation was obtained from a validated nationwide register. As a measure of alcohol exposure  both self-reported consumption and genetic variations in alcohol metabolizing genes (ADH1B/ADH1C) were used as instrumental variables. The endpoint was admission to hospital for atrial fibrillation as recorded in a validated hospital register. A total of 3493 cases of atrial fibrillation occurred during follow-up. High alcohol consumption was associated with a risk of atrial fibrillation among men  but not among women. Among the men who drank 28-35 and 35+ drinks/week  the hazards ratios were 1.40 (95% confidence interval 1.09-1.80) and 1.62 (95% confidence interval 1.27-2.05) compared with men who drank < 1 drink/week. Using genotypes as instrumental variables did not reveal a higher risk. Associations in those with high cardiovascular risk were similar to those at lower risk. Observational alcohol consumption was associated with a higher risk of atrial fibrillation in men. In women  only a high alcohol intake (28+ drinks/week) was associated with a higher risk. Participants with a high cardiovascular risk were no more sensitive towards alcohol than those at low risk. Genetic analysis did not support a causal relationship of linear association between alcohol intake and atrial fibrillation.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Collaborative assessment and management of suicidality method shows effect. Previous studies confirm the effect of collaborative assessment and management of suicidality (CAMS) in an experimental setup  but there is a need to test CAMS with regard to its effectiveness and feasibility in a real-life clinical context. The purpose of this study was to investigate CAMS in a Danish population in such a context. In the present descriptive study  CAMS treatment was administered to a total of 42 patients referred during 1 August 2008 to 30 September 2009 to The Centre of Excellence in Suicide Prevention due to suicidal thoughts or a suicide attempt. Qualitative and quantitative data were obtained before and after CAMS treatment. Five major suicidal markers were regularly assessed. The patients' experiences of the importance of the treatment were studied as endpoints. A total of 81% of the patients completed treatment and 68% hereof completed the final evaluation. 74% from this group judged the sessions to be the main factor in the elimination of their suicidality. A significant decrease was observed in the five suicidal markers recorded for the 42 patients included. One patient attempted suicide and another patient committed suicide. CAMS was assessed to be effective and useful in a real-life clinical context. Further studies in larger patient populations are needed as are studies to determine whether the CAMS method may be applied with equal effect to all patient groups. not relevant.

Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Evidence to support psychodynamic psychotherapy]. In general  psychodynamic psychotherapy is not considered evidence-based treatment. This review includes recent meta-analyses and review papers. We conclude that evidence in favour of psychodynamic psychotherapy exists for unipolar depression  panic anxiety with and without agoraphobia  social phobia  generalised anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. For complex mental conditions  long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy shows greater effect than no treatment  standard treatment and short-term psychotherapy. Psychodynamic psychotherapy can be recommended for treatment of specific psychiatric disorders.
Telemedicine,,,[Telemedical pre-hospital diagnosis of a patient with thoracic aortic dissection]. Thoracic aortic dissection is a life-threatening emergency that must be met and surmounted immediately to increase survival. In this case  telemedicine involving ECG and GSM-based communication between the patient in the ambulance and the centre doctor was used to obtain remote pre-hospital suspicion of aorta dissection. Thus  the ambulance was re-routed directly to a specialized unit where the diagnosis was confirmed and immediate and successful surgical treatment was performed. Telemedicine allowing direct communication between the patient and the doctor is recommended.
Telemedicine,,,[Telemedicine used for pre-hospital diagnosis of a patient with acute pulmonary embolism]. Mortality in untreated pulmonary embolism is high and short-term outcome depends on a timely diagnosis. In this case telemedicine involving 12-lead ECG and GSM-based communication between the patient in the ambulance and the telemedical staff resulted in remote pre-hospital suspicion of acute pulmonary embolism. The ambulance was referred directly to the nearest department of cardiology where acute CT and echocardiography confirmed the diagnosis. Acute trombolysis was successful. Telemedicine may be beneficial in other medical emergencies than acute myocardial infarction.
Global Health,Sanitation,,Global  regional  and national comparative risk assessment of 79 behavioural  environmental and occupational  and metabolic risks or clusters of risks in 188 countries  1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013. The Global Burden of Disease  Injuries  and Risk Factor study 2013 (GBD 2013) is the first of a series of annual updates of the GBD. Risk factor quantification  particularly of modifiable risk factors  can help to identify emerging threats to population health and opportunities for prevention. The GBD 2013 provides a timely opportunity to update the comparative risk assessment with new data for exposure  relative risks  and evidence on the appropriate counterfactual risk distribution. Attributable deaths  years of life lost  years lived with disability  and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) have been estimated for 79 risks or clusters of risks using the GBD 2010 methods. Risk-outcome pairs meeting explicit evidence criteria were assessed for 188 countries for the period 1990-2013 by age and sex using three inputs: risk exposure  relative risks  and the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL). Risks are organised into a hierarchy with blocks of behavioural  environmental and occupational  and metabolic risks at the first level of the hierarchy. The next level in the hierarchy includes nine clusters of related risks and two individual risks  with more detail provided at levels 3 and 4 of the hierarchy. Compared with GBD 2010  six new risk factors have been added: handwashing practices  occupational exposure to trichloroethylene  childhood wasting  childhood stunting  unsafe sex  and low glomerular filtration rate. For most risks  data for exposure were synthesised with a Bayesian meta-regression method  DisMod-MR 2.0  or spatial-temporal Gaussian process regression. Relative risks were based on meta-regressions of published cohort and intervention studies. Attributable burden for clusters of risks and all risks combined took into account evidence on the mediation of some risks such as high body-mass index (BMI) through other risks such as high systolic blood pressure and high cholesterol. All risks combined account for 57·2% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 55·8-58·5) of deaths and 41·6% (40·1-43·0) of DALYs. Risks quantified account for 87·9% (86·5-89·3) of cardiovascular disease DALYs  ranging to a low of 0% for neonatal disorders and neglected tropical diseases and malaria. In terms of global DALYs in 2013  six risks or clusters of risks each caused more than 5% of DALYs: dietary risks accounting for 11·3 million deaths and 241·4 million DALYs  high systolic blood pressure for 10·4 million deaths and 208·1 million DALYs  child and maternal malnutrition for 1·7 million deaths and 176·9 million DALYs  tobacco smoke for 6·1 million deaths and 143·5 million DALYs  air pollution for 5·5 million deaths and 141·5 million DALYs  and high BMI for 4·4 million deaths and 134·0 million DALYs. Risk factor patterns vary across regions and countries and with time. In sub-Saharan Africa  the leading risk factors are child and maternal malnutrition  unsafe sex  and unsafe water  sanitation  and handwashing. In women  in nearly all countries in the Americas  north Africa  and the Middle East  and in many other high-income countries  high BMI is the leading risk factor  with high systolic blood pressure as the leading risk in most of Central and Eastern Europe and south and east Asia. For men  high systolic blood pressure or tobacco use are the leading risks in nearly all high-income countries  in north Africa and the Middle East  Europe  and Asia. For men and women  unsafe sex is the leading risk in a corridor from Kenya to South Africa. Behavioural  environmental and occupational  and metabolic risks can explain half of global mortality and more than one-third of global DALYs providing many opportunities for prevention. Of the larger risks  the attributable burden of high BMI has increased in the past 23 years. In view of the prominence of behavioural risk factors  behavioural and social science research on interventions for these risks should be strengthened. Many prevention and primary care policy options are available now to act on key risks. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
Global Health,,,Global  regional  and national disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for 306 diseases and injuries and healthy life expectancy (HALE) for 188 countries  1990-2013: quantifying the epidemiological transition. The Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013) aims to bring together all available epidemiological data using a coherent measurement framework  standardised estimation methods  and transparent data sources to enable comparisons of health loss over time and across causes  age-sex groups  and countries. The GBD can be used to generate summary measures such as disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and healthy life expectancy (HALE) that make possible comparative assessments of broad epidemiological patterns across countries and time. These summary measures can also be used to quantify the component of variation in epidemiology that is related to sociodemographic development. We used the published GBD 2013 data for age-specific mortality  years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs)  and years lived with disability (YLDs) to calculate DALYs and HALE for 1990  1995  2000  2005  2010  and 2013 for 188 countries. We calculated HALE using the Sullivan method; 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) represent uncertainty in age-specific death rates and YLDs per person for each country  age  sex  and year. We estimated DALYs for 306 causes for each country as the sum of YLLs and YLDs; 95% UIs represent uncertainty in YLL and YLD rates. We quantified patterns of the epidemiological transition with a composite indicator of sociodemographic status  which we constructed from income per person  average years of schooling after age 15 years  and the total fertility rate and mean age of the population. We applied hierarchical regression to DALY rates by cause across countries to decompose variance related to the sociodemographic status variable  country  and time. Worldwide  from 1990 to 2013  life expectancy at birth rose by 6·2 years (95% UI 5·6-6·6)  from 65·3 years (65·0-65·6) in 1990 to 71·5 years (71·0-71·9) in 2013  HALE at birth rose by 5·4 years (4·9-5·8)  from 56·9 years (54·5-59·1) to 62·3 years (59·7-64·8)  total DALYs fell by 3·6% (0·3-7·4)  and age-standardised DALY rates per 100 000 people fell by 26·7% (24·6-29·1). For communicable  maternal  neonatal  and nutritional disorders  global DALY numbers  crude rates  and age-standardised rates have all declined between 1990 and 2013  whereas for non-communicable diseases  global DALYs have been increasing  DALY rates have remained nearly constant  and age-standardised DALY rates declined during the same period. From 2005 to 2013  the number of DALYs increased for most specific non-communicable diseases  including cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms  in addition to dengue  food-borne trematodes  and leishmaniasis; DALYs decreased for nearly all other causes. By 2013  the five leading causes of DALYs were ischaemic heart disease  lower respiratory infections  cerebrovascular disease  low back and neck pain  and road injuries. Sociodemographic status explained more than 50% of the variance between countries and over time for diarrhoea  lower respiratory infections  and other common infectious diseases; maternal disorders; neonatal disorders; nutritional deficiencies; other communicable  maternal  neonatal  and nutritional diseases; musculoskeletal disorders; and other non-communicable diseases. However  sociodemographic status explained less than 10% of the variance in DALY rates for cardiovascular diseases; chronic respiratory diseases; cirrhosis; diabetes  urogenital  blood  and endocrine diseases; unintentional injuries; and self-harm and interpersonal violence. Predictably  increased sociodemographic status was associated with a shift in burden from YLLs to YLDs  driven by declines in YLLs and increases in YLDs from musculoskeletal disorders  neurological disorders  and mental and substance use disorders. In most country-specific estimates  the increase in life expectancy was greater than that in HALE. Leading causes of DALYs are highly variable across countries. Global health is improving. Population growth and ageing have driven up numbers of DALYs  but crude rates have remained relatively constant  showing that progress in health does not mean fewer demands on health systems. The notion of an epidemiological transition--in which increasing sociodemographic status brings structured change in disease burden--is useful  but there is tremendous variation in burden of disease that is not associated with sociodemographic status. This further underscores the need for country-specific assessments of DALYs and HALE to appropriately inform health policy decisions and attendant actions. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
Global Health,,,Global  regional  and national incidence and mortality for HIV  tuberculosis  and malaria during 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013. The Millennium Declaration in 2000 brought special global attention to HIV  tuberculosis  and malaria through the formulation of Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 6. The Global Burden of Disease 2013 study provides a consistent and comprehensive approach to disease estimation for between 1990 and 2013  and an opportunity to assess whether accelerated progress has occured since the Millennium Declaration. To estimate incidence and mortality for HIV  we used the UNAIDS Spectrum model appropriately modified based on a systematic review of available studies of mortality with and without antiretroviral therapy (ART). For concentrated epidemics  we calibrated Spectrum models to fit vital registration data corrected for misclassification of HIV deaths. In generalised epidemics  we minimised a loss function to select epidemic curves most consistent with prevalence data and demographic data for all-cause mortality. We analysed counterfactual scenarios for HIV to assess years of life saved through prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) and ART. For tuberculosis  we analysed vital registration and verbal autopsy data to estimate mortality using cause of death ensemble modelling. We analysed data for corrected case-notifications  expert opinions on the case-detection rate  prevalence surveys  and estimated cause-specific mortality using Bayesian meta-regression to generate consistent trends in all parameters. We analysed malaria mortality and incidence using an updated cause of death database  a systematic analysis of verbal autopsy validation studies for malaria  and recent studies (2010-13) of incidence  drug resistance  and coverage of insecticide-treated bednets. Globally in 2013  there were 1·8 million new HIV infections (95% uncertainty interval 1·7 million to 2·1 million)  29·2 million prevalent HIV cases (28·1 to 31·7)  and 1·3 million HIV deaths (1·3 to 1·5). At the peak of the epidemic in 2005  HIV caused 1·7 million deaths (1·6 million to 1·9 million). Concentrated epidemics in Latin America and eastern Europe are substantially smaller than previously estimated. Through interventions including PMTCT and ART  19·1 million life-years (16·6 million to 21·5 million) have been saved  70·3% (65·4 to 76·1) in developing countries. From 2000 to 2011  the ratio of development assistance for health for HIV to years of life saved through intervention was US$4498 in developing countries. Including in HIV-positive individuals  all-form tuberculosis incidence was 7·5 million (7·4 million to 7·7 million)  prevalence was 11·9 million (11·6 million to 12·2 million)  and number of deaths was 1·4 million (1·3 million to 1·5 million) in 2013. In the same year and in only individuals who were HIV-negative  all-form tuberculosis incidence was 7·1 million (6·9 million to 7·3 million)  prevalence was 11·2 million (10·8 million to 11·6 million)  and number of deaths was 1·3 million (1·2 million to 1·4 million). Annualised rates of change (ARC) for incidence  prevalence  and death became negative after 2000. Tuberculosis in HIV-negative individuals disproportionately occurs in men and boys (versus women and girls); 64·0% of cases (63·6 to 64·3) and 64·7% of deaths (60·8 to 70·3). Globally  malaria cases and deaths grew rapidly from 1990 reaching a peak of 232 million cases (143 million to 387 million) in 2003 and 1·2 million deaths (1·1 million to 1·4 million) in 2004. Since 2004  child deaths from malaria in sub-Saharan Africa have decreased by 31·5% (15·7 to 44·1). Outside of Africa  malaria mortality has been steadily decreasing since 1990. Our estimates of the number of people living with HIV are 18·7% smaller than UNAIDS's estimates in 2012. The number of people living with malaria is larger than estimated by WHO. The number of people living with HIV  tuberculosis  or malaria have all decreased since 2000. At the global level  upward trends for malaria and HIV deaths have been reversed and declines in tuberculosis deaths have accelerated. 101 countries (74 of which are developing) still have increasing HIV incidence. Substantial progress since the Millennium Declaration is an encouraging sign of the effect of global action. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
Global Health,,,Global  regional  and national levels and causes of maternal mortality during 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013. The fifth Millennium Development Goal (MDG 5) established the goal of a 75% reduction in the maternal mortality ratio (MMR; number of maternal deaths per 100 000 livebirths) between 1990 and 2015. We aimed to measure levels and track trends in maternal mortality  the key causes contributing to maternal death  and timing of maternal death with respect to delivery. We used robust statistical methods including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) to analyse a database of data for 7065 site-years and estimate the number of maternal deaths from all causes in 188 countries between 1990 and 2013. We estimated the number of pregnancy-related deaths caused by HIV on the basis of a systematic review of the relative risk of dying during pregnancy for HIV-positive women compared with HIV-negative women. We also estimated the fraction of these deaths aggravated by pregnancy on the basis of a systematic review. To estimate the numbers of maternal deaths due to nine different causes  we identified 61 sources from a systematic review and 943 site-years of vital registration data. We also did a systematic review of reports about the timing of maternal death  identifying 142 sources to use in our analysis. We developed estimates for each country for 1990-2013 using Bayesian meta-regression. We estimated 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for all values. 292 982 (95% UI 261 017-327 792) maternal deaths occurred in 2013  compared with 376 034 (343 483-407 574) in 1990. The global annual rate of change in the MMR was -0·3% (-1·1 to 0·6) from 1990 to 2003  and -2·7% (-3·9 to -1·5) from 2003 to 2013  with evidence of continued acceleration. MMRs reduced consistently in south  east  and southeast Asia between 1990 and 2013  but maternal deaths increased in much of sub-Saharan Africa during the 1990s. 2070 (1290-2866) maternal deaths were related to HIV in 2013  0·4% (0·2-0·6) of the global total. MMR was highest in the oldest age groups in both 1990 and 2013. In 2013  most deaths occurred intrapartum or postpartum. Causes varied by region and between 1990 and 2013. We recorded substantial variation in the MMR by country in 2013  from 956·8 (685·1-1262·8) in South Sudan to 2·4 (1·6-3·6) in Iceland. Global rates of change suggest that only 16 countries will achieve the MDG 5 target by 2015. Accelerated reductions since the Millennium Declaration in 2000 coincide with increased development assistance for maternal  newborn  and child health. Setting of targets and associated interventions for after 2015 will need careful consideration of regions that are making slow progress  such as west and central Africa.

Family Practice,,,[Abdominal obesity and associated comorbidities among primary care patients]. Abdominal obesity is associated with type 2 diabetes  cardiovascular disease  dyslipidemia and hypertension. The prevalence of abdominal obesity and its relationship with these comorbidities have not previously been examined in Danish primary care patients. The IDEA study was an international cross sectional study including 168 159 patients worldwide. In Denmark  47 randomly selected general practitioners included 847 consecutive patients. Age  gender  waist circumference  body mass index (BMI) and the presence of known comorbidities were recorded for all patients. The prevalence of abdominal obesity (waist circumference = 80 cm for women and = 94 cm for men) was 66% among women and 60% among men. There was a significant relationship between the degree of abdominal obesity and the prevalence of diabetes  dyslipidemia and hypertension for both sexes. There was a trend towards an increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease with increased waist circumference. Abdominal obesity is very frequently found in Danish primary care patients  and it is associated with an increased prevalence of diabetes  dyslipidemia and hypertension. Patients with increased waist circumference should be screened to diagnose comorbidities related to the abdominal obesity.
Rheumatology,,,Interplay between patient global assessment  pain  and fatigue and influence of other clinical disease activity measures in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. The interplay between patient-reported outcome measures in rheumatology is not well clarified. The objective of the study was to examine associations on the group level and concordance on the individual patient level between patient global assessment (PaGl)  pain  and fatigue as scored on visual analog scales (VAS) in the daily clinic by patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Associations with other measures of disease activity were also examined. Traditional disease activity data on 221 RA patients with active disease planned to initiate biological treatment were extracted from the Danish DANBIO registry. Associations between VAS PaGl  pain  and fatigue (0-100) were examined using multiple regression analysis. Concordance between the VAS scores was expressed as the bias (mean difference between intra-individual scores) and the 95% lower and upper limits of agreement (LLoA; ULoA) according to the Bland-Altman method. Mean age was 57 ± 14 years  mean Disease Activity Score (DAS28-CRP4) 5.0 ± 0.9  and mean PaGl 63.6 ± 22.6. PaGl was most strongly predicted by pain and fatigue  pain by PaGl and fatigue  and fatigue by PaGl and pain (beta ranging from 0.17 to 0.69  p < 0.01-0.0001). More objective measures were not or far less predictive. LLoA;ULoA [bias] for PaGl vs. pain was -19.1; 29.5 [5.2]  for PaGl vs. fatigue -22.8; 28.6 [2.9]  and for fatigue vs. pain -29.2; 33.8 [2.3]. In conclusion  PaGl  pain  and fatigue were most strongly explained by each other  not by more objective clinical measures of disease activity and were nearly identical on the group level. On the individual patient level  however  differences between the scores varied considerably. The findings highlight the challenge of understanding and dealing with traditional patient-reported VAS measures when it comes to individual RA patients in the daily clinic.
Rheumatology,,,Impact of healthcare design on patients' perception of a rheumatology outpatient infusion room: an interventional pilot study. Evidence-based healthcare design is a concept aimed at reducing stress factors in the physical environment for the benefit of patients and the medical staff. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of room modifications on patients' perception of an outpatient infusion room used for treating rheumatologic diseases. Patient and nurse interviews  a staff workshop and field observations were performed to identify environmental room factors important for the patients  and the room was modified accordingly. The changes included the colours  atmosphere and functionality of the room. Artificial plants and a water bubble wall were added to the room. Forty-four patients receiving intravenous biologic therapy for inflammatory arthritis completed a questionnaire before and after the intervention. The agreement with 25 statements regarding the environmental room factors was scored (range 0-4). A total score was calculated as the sum of all 25 scores (range 0-100). The median (range) age was 55 (28-78) years. Seventeen out of 25 scores improved significantly (p < 0.000-0.050)  none deteriorated. The amount of decorating and room colours  for example  was scored significantly higher after the intervention (p < 0.000)  and the atmosphere was considered significantly more comfortable and "safe" (p < 0.005). The total score increased from 63.0 (34-88) to 81.0 (48-100) (p < 0.000). The study suggests that room modifications according to the principles of evidence-based healthcare design may have the potential to improve patients' perception of outpatient infusion rooms used for treating rheumatologic diseases.
Rheumatology,,,Test-retest reliability of the disease activity score 28 CRP (DAS28-CRP)  the simplified disease activity index (SDAI) and the clinical disease activity index (CDAI) in rheumatoid arthritis when based on patient self-assessment of tender and swollen joints. Composite disease activity scores are frequently used in daily practice as tools for treatment decisions in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). If reliable  patient-reported disease activity may be time saving in the busy clinic. The objective was to examine the test-retest reliability of the Disease Activity Score 28 CRP (DAS28-CRP) with four variables (4v) and three variables (3v)  the Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) and the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) when based on patient self-assessment of tender and swollen joints and to examine the agreement between these scores and physician-derived scores. Thirty out-clinic RA patients with stable disease were included. A joint count was performed two times 1 week apart by the patient and by an experienced physician. Test-retest reliability was expressed as the least significant difference (LSD)  as the LSD in percent of the mean score (%LSD) and as intra-individual coefficients of variation (CVi). Mean scores based on physician vs. patient joint counts (visit 1) were: DAS28-CRP(4v) 3.5 ± 1.0 vs. 3.6 ± 1.1 (not significant (NS))  DAS28-CRP(3v) 3.4 ± 0.9 vs. 3.5 ± 0.9 (NS)  SDAI 14.2 ± 9.4 vs.14.1 ± 9.4 (NS) and CDAI 13.4 ± 9.3 vs. 13.3 ± 9.4 (NS). The LSDs (%LSD) for duplicate assessments of patient-derived scores (visit 2 vs. 1) were: DAS28-CRP(4v) 0.8 (23.2)  DAS28-CRP(3v) 0.9 (25.2)  SDAI 8.3 (59.9) and CDAI 8.4 (63.8). Similar LSDs were found for differences between duplicate assessments of physician-derived scores and for differences between physician and patient-derived scores. CVis for SDAI and CDAI were significantly higher than for DAS28-CRP(4v) and DAS28-CRP(3v) (p < 0.005). Patient- and physician-derived scores agreed closely on group level. On the individual level  the LSDs between patient- and physician-derived scores were considerable but corresponded to both patient and physician intra-observer LSDs. Thus  scores based on patient-performed joint counts may be an alternative to traditional physician-derived scores in patients with stable disease.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,ESPEN Guidelines on Parenteral Nutrition: gastroenterology. Undernutrition as well as specific nutrient deficiencies has been described in patients with Crohn's disease (CD)  ulcerative colitis (UC) and short bowel syndrome. In the latter  water and electrolytes disturbances may be a major problem. The present guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the indications  application and type of parenteral formula to be used in acute and chronic phases of illness. Parenteral nutrition is not recommended as a primary treatment in CD and UC. The use of parenteral nutrition is however reliable when oral/enteral feeding is not possible. There is a lack of data supporting specific nutrients in these conditions. Parenteral nutrition is mandatory in case of intestinal failure  at least in the acute period. In patients with short bowel  specific attention should be paid to water and electrolyte supplementation. Currently  the use of growth hormone  glutamine and GLP-2 cannot be recommended in patients with short bowel.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,ESPEN Guidelines on Parenteral Nutrition: home parenteral nutrition (HPN) in adult patients. Home parenteral nutrition (HPN) was introduced as a treatment modality in the early 1970s primarily for the treatment of chronic intestinal failure in patients with benign disease. The relatively low morbidity and mortality associated with HPN has encouraged its widespread use in western countries. Thus there is huge clinical experience  but there are still few controlled clinical studies of treatment effects and management of complications. The purpose of these guidelines is to highlight areas of good practice and promote the use of standardized treatment protocols between centers. The guidelines may serve as a framework for development of policies and procedures.
Preventive Medicine,Public Health,,Socio-demographic determinants of participation in mammography screening. Our objective was to use individual data on socio-demographic characteristics to identify predictors of participation in mammography screening and control to what extent they can explain the regional difference. We used data from mammography screening programmes in Copenhagen  1991-1999  and Funen  1993-2001  Denmark. Target groups were identified from the Population Register  screening data came from the health authority  and socio-demographic data from Statistics Denmark. Included were women eligible for at least 3 screens. The crude RR of never use versus always use was 3.21 (95%CI  3.07-3.35) for Copenhagen versus Funen  and the adjusted RR was 2.55 (95%CI  2.43-2.67). The adjusted RR for never use among women without contact to a primary care physician was 2.50 (95% CI  2.31-2.71) and 2.89 (95% CI  2.66-3.14)  and for women without dental care 2.94 (95% CI  2.77-3.12) and 2.88 (95% CI  2.68-3.10) for Copenhagen and Funen  respectively. Other important predictive factors for nonparticipation were not being married and not being Danish. In conclusion  to enhance participation in mammography screening programmes special attention needs to be given to women not using other primary health care services. All women in Copenhagen  irrespective of their socio-demographic characteristics  had low participation. Screening programmes have to find ways to handle this urbanity factor.
Pathology  Clinical,,,Significant Individual Variation Between Pathologists in the Evaluation of Colon Cancer Specimens After Complete Mesocolic Excision. After the introduction of complete mesocolic excision  a new pathological evaluation of the resected colon cancer specimen was introduced. This concept has quickly gained acceptance and is often used to compare surgical quality. The grading of colon cancer specimens is likely to depend on both surgical quality and the training of the pathologist. The purpose of this study was to validate the principles of the pathological evaluation of colon cancer specimens. This was an exploratory study. The study was conducted in Aarhus  Denmark  and Leeds  United Kingdom. Colon cancers specimens were used. The agreement of gradings between participants was of interest. Four specialist GI pathologists and 2 abdominal surgeons evaluated 2 rounds of colon cancer specimens  each at 2 separate time points. Each round contained 50 specimens. After the first round  a protocol of detailed principles for the grading procedure was agreed on. Results from an experienced pathologist were considered as the reference results. In the first round  the distribution of gradings between participants showed substantial variation. In the second round  the variation was reduced. Intraobserver agreement was mostly fair to good  whereas interobserver agreement was frequently poor. This did not significantly change from round 1 to round 2. The small sample size of 100 specimens provided a very small number of specimens resected in the muscularis propria plane  which renders the evaluation of this group potentially unreliable. The evaluations were made on photos and not on fresh specimens. This study demonstrates significant variation in the pathological evaluation of colon cancer specimens. It demonstrates that it cannot be used in clinical studies  and care should be taken when comparing results between different hospitals.
Podiatry,,,Clinical management of acute diabetic Charcot foot in Denmark. Charcot foot is a severe complication to diabetes mellitus and treatment involves several different clinical specialities. Our objective was to describe the current awareness  knowledge and treatment practices of Charcot foot among doctors who handle diabetic foot disorders. This study is based on a questionnaire survey sent out to healthcare professionals  primarily doctors  working with diabetic foot ulcers and Charcot feet in the public sector of the Danish healthcare system. The survey obtained a 52% response rate. A temperature difference of > 2 °C between the two feet was the most used method of diagnosing Charcot foot. Along with clinical inspection  temperature difference was also the measurement used for monitoring of healing. None of the suggested formalised classification systems were used to any extent. Most responders use detachable bandages for offloading (83%). All centres use some form of a multidisciplinary team  with the most common permanent members being orthopaedic surgeons (71%)  wound specialist nurses (76%)  podiatrists (65%)  endocrinologists (47%) and diabetes specialist nurses (41%). We conducted a survey of the diagnosis and treatment practices of acute diabetic Charcot foot at diabetes foot clinics in Denmark. The responders seem to follow the international recommendations and guidelines on management of the acute diabetic Charcot foot  despite a lack of Danish guidelines. none. not relevant.
Pharmacogenetics,,,Pharmacogenetics of clinical response to risperidone. Despite risperidone's proven safety and efficacy  existing pharmacogenetic knowledge could be applied to improve its clinical use. The present work aims to summarize the information about genetic polymorphisms affecting risperidone adverse reactions and efficacy during routine clinical practice. The most relevant genes involved in the metabolism of the drug (i.e.  CYP2D6  CYP3A and ABCB1) appear to have the greatest potential to predict differences in plasma concentrations of the drug and its interactions  but also relate to side effects  such as neuroleptic syndrome  weight gain or polydipsia. Other genes that have been found in association at least twice with any adverse reactions including metabolic changes  extrapyramidal symptoms or prolactine increase are: 5HT2A; 5HT2C; 5HT6; DRD2; DRD3; and BDNF. Some of these genes (5HTR2A  DRD2 and DRD3)  along with 5-HTTLPR and COMT  have also been reported to be related with negative clinical outcomes. However  there is not yet enough evidence to support their routine screening during clinical practice.
Pathology  Clinical,,,Lesions of the lacrimal drainage system: a clinicopathological study of 643 biopsy specimens of the lacrimal drainage system in Denmark 1910-1999. To determine the frequency of histologically verified lesions of the lacrimal drainage system in Denmark between the years 1910 and 1999. Furthermore  to correlate the clinical diagnosis with the pathology diagnosis. Retrospective review of all pathology reports from 1910 to 1999 in the files of the Eye Pathology Institute  University of Copenhagen  describing a lesion of the lacrimal drainage system. In addition  a retrospective review of all reports describing a lesion of the lacrimal drainage system from the Danish Pathology Database. All specimens were re-evaluated  except in cases with a primary diagnosis of dacryocystitis. In these cases a sample of 25% was re-evaluated. A total of 643 lesions were collected. Dacryocystitis was the most frequent lesion  constituting 508 cases (79%). The remaining cases were diagnosed as dacryolithiasis (62 cases; 7.9%)  tumour (29 cases; 4.5%)  trauma (19 cases; 3.0%)  congenital malformation (nine cases; 1.4%)  canaliculitis (eight cases; 1.2%) and granulomatous inflammation (eight cases; 1.2%). Seventeen tumours were malignant  of which B-cell lymphoma was the most common (six cases). In 0.6% of cases with a clinical diagnosis of dacryocystitis/lithiasis a non-suspected malignant tumour was diagnosed. Micro-organisms were uncommon in dacryocystitis (9%) but frequent in cases of dacryolithiasis (87%). Dacryocystitis was by far the most frequent lesion of the lacrimal drainage system referred for histopathological evaluation. Dacryolithiasis was often associated with micro-organisms  especially Gram positive rods. Histopathology is necessary to confirm suspected tumours  more than half of which were inflammatory lesions  and to detect tumours that sometimes masquerade as inflammation.
Family Practice,,,[Investigation of lower urinary tract symptoms among men in general practice and in hospitals]. Many men over 50 years of age have lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). It is therefore important that evaluation of symptoms and treatment decision is mainly taken care of by the family practitioner. A guideline for evaluation of LUTS is described  giving the family practitioner an adequate tool for evaluation and decision-making. The guidelines also describe which patients should be referred to an urologist and the extent of supplementary evaluation that should be performed in this setting.
Pharmacology,,,Sensitivity to the thromboxane A2 analog U46619 varies with inner diameter in human stem villous arteries. The vascular resistance of stem villous arteries is determined by the balance between different contractile and relaxant agents and in the utero-placental circulation. Thromboxane A2 (TxA2)  prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) are considered to be among the most important contractile factors. However  it is not known if their contractile effects are consistent along the villous tree. We hypothesized that the sensitivity to different agonists could be influenced by artery diameter and thus that their contribution to placental vascular resistance may differ. Using an isometric wire myograph  the contractility and sensitivity (pD2) to the thromboxane A2 mimetic U46619  PGF2α and ET-1 were investigated in isolated human stem villous arteries and human uterine fundus and isthmus arteries obtained from healthy  pregnant women who had experienced uncomplicated pregnancy. In fetal arteries  the pD2 values for U46619 correlated positively with arterial diameter with no such dependence observed for ET-1 and PGF2α. In maternal arteries  pD2 remained constant for all the agonists tested despite highly variable vessel diameter. A selective decrease in sensitivity to TxA2 receptor stimulation was observed with decreasing vascular diameter in human stem villous arteries. The contractile factors PGF2α and ET-1 show no such relationship.
Rehabilitation,,,High readmission rates and mental distress after infective endocarditis - Results from the national population-based CopenHeart IE survey. Infective endocarditis (IE) is a severe disease requiring lengthy hospitalisation. Little is known about patients' recovery after IE. The aims of this study in IE patients were; (i) to describe mortality  readmission  self-reported health and rehabilitation up to 1year post-discharge  (ii) to examine associations between self-reported health and readmission  and (iii) to investigate predictors of readmission and mortality. All adults treated for IE in Denmark  January-June 2011 (N=347)  were followed in registers. Eligible individuals (n=209) were invited to participate in a questionnaire survey (responders n=122). Responses were compared with those of a background reference population and a heart valve surgery population. Mortality and readmission data from registers 12months post-discharge were investigated. Patients discharged after treatment for IE had a mortality of 18% (95% confidence interval (CI): 14%-23%) one year post-discharge and 65% (95% CI: 59%-71%) had been readmitted  the majority (82%) acutely. Patients had lower self-reported health compared to the background population (physical component scale (PCS); mean (standard deviation (SD)): 42.2 (11.1) vs. 47.1 (12.1)  (p=0.0004)  mental component scale (MCS); 50.1 (11.7) vs. 53.8 (9.2)  (p=0.006)  and more were sedentary (29 vs. 15%)  (p=0.002). Large proportions had clinical signs of anxiety and depression  25% and 22% respectively  exceeding a hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) cut-off score of 8. Almost half (47%) had not been offered cardiac rehabilitation (CR). After IE  mortality and readmission rates were high and self-reported physical and mental health poor. These findings call for changes in in-hospital and post-discharge management.
Rehabilitation,,,The patient education - Learning and Coping Strategies - improves adherence in cardiac rehabilitation (LC-REHAB): A randomised controlled trial. Despite proven benefits of cardiac rehabilitation (CR)  adherence to CR remains suboptimal. This trial aimed to assess the impact of the patient education 'Learning and Coping Strategies' (LC) on patient adherence to an eight-week CR program. 825 patients with ischaemic heart disease or heart failure were open label randomised to either the LC arm (LC plus CR) or the control arm (CR alone) across three hospital units in Denmark. Both arms received same amount of training and education hours. LC consisted of individual clarifying interviews  participation of experienced patients as co-educators  situational  reflective and inductive teaching. The control arm received structured deductive teaching. The primary outcomes were patient adherence to at least 75% of the exercise training or education sessions. We tested for subgroup effects on the primary outcomes using interaction terms. The primary outcomes were compared across arms using logistic regression. More patients in the LC arm adhered to at least 75% of the exercise training sessions than control (80% versus 73%  adjusted odds ratio (OR):1.48; 95% CI:1.07 to 2.05  P=0.018) and 75% of education sessions (79% versus 70%  adjusted OR:1.61  1.17 to 2.22  P=0.003). Some evidence of larger effects of LC on adherence was seen for patients with heart failure  low education and household income. Addition of LC strategies improved adherence in rehabilitation both in terms of exercise training and education. Patients with heart failure  low levels of education and household income appear to benefit most from this adherence promoting intervention. www.clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01668394.
Cardiac Rehabilitation,,,Cardiac rehabilitation patients' perspectives on the recovery following heart valve surgery: a narrative analysis. To explore the structure and content of narratives about the recovery process among patients undergoing heart valve surgery participating in cardiac rehabilitation. Several studies with short-term follow-up have shown that recovering from cardiac surgery can be challenging  but evidence on the long-term recovery process is very limited  especially following heart valve surgery. Furthermore  few studies have explored the recovery process among cardiac rehabilitation participants. A qualitative study with serial interviews analysed using narrative methods. We collected data over 18 months (April 2013-October 2014). We recruited nine patients undergoing heart valve surgery from a randomized trial  CopenHeartVR and conducted 27 individual narrative interviews at 2-3 weeks  3-4 months and 8-9 months after surgery. Following heart valve surgery  the participants expected to return to normality. The analysis identified four courses of recovery  with three non-linear complex pathways deviating from the classic restitution narrative: the frustrated struggle to resume normality  the challenged expectation of normality - being in a limbo and becoming a heart patient. These deviating pathways were characterized by physical  existential and mental challenges even up to 9 months after surgery. The recovery processes of participants' in cardiac rehabilitation were often more complicated than anticipated. Patients undergoing heart valve surgery may benefit from more extensive medical follow-up immediately after discharge  individual psychological assessment and individualized  realistic information about the recovery trajectory.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Complications following construction and closure of loop ileostomies]. A protective loop ileostomy is used to reduce the incidence and consequences of anastomotic failure following colorectal resection. Closure of a loop ileostomy is associated with low mortality but many studies have demonstrated high morbidity rates. The aim of this review is to examine the existing evidence on the morbidity following closure of loop ileostomies and to investigate possible risk factors for complications. There is no consensus in the literature about the risk factors for complications. Counseling of the patient about the risks for complications is emphasized.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Anastomotic leakage after anterior resection for rectal cancer]. On the basis of the literature about anastomotic leakage after anterior resection for rectal cancer a review is presented of the frequency  potential risk factors and consequences of leakage. The risk factors are evaluated according to the level of scientific evidence of the individual background articles  and based upon the best documented risk factors recommendations are proposed for prophylactic measures against anastomotic leakage. Furthermore  proposals for future research in the area are presented.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Treatment of degenerative dementia disorders--who should be treated?]. Recommendations for treatment with specific antidementia drugs in Denmark are given on the basis of recent evidence. Such evidence supports treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease (AD) with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AchEI)  and moderate to severe AD with memantine. Combination therapy with these drugs can be considered in moderate AD. Dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease with dementia should be treated with rivastigmine. There is not sufficient evidence to recommend treatment with AchEI or memantine in pure vascular dementia or frontotemporal dementia.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[The National List of recommendations-- what is it based on?]. The National List of recommendations is a scientific survey of the most used drugs. It separates the drugs into three groups: 1) recommended drugs  2) drugs only to be used in special circumstances  and 3) drugs which should not be used in normal circumstances because of too limited efficacy or serious adverse reactions. The list is made by specialists chosen by the scientific bodies. The Institute of Rational Pharmacotherapy acts as secretariat. The primary selection criterion is the relationship between effect and adverse reactions  while price issues are not considered. Special consideration has been given to how the effect is expressed  composite measurements of effect and to extrapolation. The list  which is updated annually  is available at the IRF's homepage. The list of recommendations is primarily an instrument for general practitioners and drug committees; in future it should be integrated into the regional drug lists.
Family Practice,,,Promotional methods used by representatives of drug companies: a prospective survey in general practice. To examine the extent and composition of pharmaceutical industry representatives' marketing techniques with a particular focus on drug sampling in relation to drug age. A group of 47 GPs prospectively collected data on drug promotional activities during a six-month period  and a sub-sample of 10 GPs furthermore recorded the representatives' marketing techniques in detail. Primary healthcare. General practitioners in the County of Funen  Denmark. Promotional visits and corresponding marketing techniques. The 47 GPs recorded 1050 visits corresponding to a median of 19 (range 3 to 63) per GP in the six months. The majority of drugs promoted (52%) were marketed more than five years ago. There was a statistically significant decline in the proportion of visits where drug samples were offered with drug age  but the decline was small OR 0.97 (95% CI 0.95;0.98) per year. Leaflets (68%)  suggestions on how to improve therapy for a specific patient registered with the practice (53%)  drug samples (48%)  and gifts (36%) were the most frequently used marketing techniques. Drug-industry representatives use a variety of promotional methods. The tendency to hand out drug samples was statistically significantly associated with drug age  but the decline was small.
Orthopedics,,,The effects of introducing a clinical pharmacist on orthopaedic wards in Denmark. To assess the effects and cost effects of introducing clinical pharmacists on hospital wards. Comparative prospective study on four orthopaedic surgical wards in two hospitals. The primary effect variables were 10 target areas widely considered to be indicators of good prescription practice. Prescriptions not following good practice in these intervention areas were defined as "sub-optimal prescriptions " and then discussed between a physician and a clinical pharmacist. The primary parameter was the difference in the number of days with a sub-optimal prescription (Mann-Whitney test). On an average 20% of all the patients had a sub-optimal prescription. Of these  70% were changed by the physician after intervention by the clinical pharmacist. There was a statistically significant difference in the duration of days in treatment with a sub-optimal prescription. Where sub-optimal prescriptions were changed  43% resulted in cost reductions. The reductions achieved could cover 47% of the costs of clinical pharmacy service. Clinical pharmacy services offered to four orthopaedic surgical wards resulted in reduction of sub-optimal prescriptions. Every time the pharmacist screened seven patients one sub-optimal prescription was found and adjusted. The reduction in medicine costs due to adjusted sub-optimal prescriptions could not cover the whole cost of clinical pharmacy service.
Evidence-Based Medicine,Family Practice,Pharmacoepidemiology,Factor analysis improves the selection of prescribing indicators. To test a method for improving the selection of indicators of general practitioners' prescribing. We conducted a prescription database study including all 180 general practices in the County of Funen  Denmark  approximately 472 000 inhabitants. Principal factor analysis was used to model correlation between 19 register-based indicators for the quality of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) prescribing. The correlation between indicators ranged widely from 0 to 0.93. Factor analysis revealed three dimensions of quality: (1) "Coxib preference"  comprising indicators directly quantifying choice of coxibs  indicators measuring expenditure per Defined Daily Dose  and indicators taking risk aspects into account  (2) "Frequent NSAID prescribing"  comprising indicators quantifying prevalence or amount of NSAID prescribing  and (3) "Diverse NSAID choice"  comprising indicators focusing on the width of GPs' formularies. The number of indicators for measuring the important aspects of quality in prescribing of NSAIDs could be reduced substantially by selecting the indicator in each dimension with the highest factor loading. A high preference for coxibs indicated both appropriate and inappropriate prescribing  as revealed by the correlation of the indicators in the first factor. Correlation and factor analysis is a feasible method that assists the selection of indicators and gives better insight into prescribing patterns.
Telemedicine,,,High Prevalence of Hypertension in a Danish Population Telemedical Home Measurement of Blood Pressure in Citizens Aged 55-64 Years in Holstebro County. Home blood pressure (HBP) is prognostically superior to office BP (OBP) and similar to ambulatory BP measurements. We determined the prevalence of hypertension using HBP with telemedical data transmission in the municipality of Holstebro  Denmark (57 000 citizens). Using the Civil Registration System  we invited citizens aged 55-64 years to have their OBP and HBP measured using telemedical data transmission. Elevated OBP was defined as ≥140/90mm Hg. HBP was measured 3 times daily on 3 consecutive days with 3 measurements on each occasion. HBP was the mean of all measurements on day 1 and 3  and hypertension was defined as ≥135/85mm Hg. We included 3 102 citizens who had performed at least 12 HBP measurements during day 2 and 3. Group 1: (n = 1 464  47%) had both normal OBP and HBP. Group 2: (n = 838  27%) had both elevated OBP and HBP indicating persistent hypertension. Group 3: (n = 560  18%) had elevated OBP and normal HBP indicating white coat hypertension (WCH). Group 4: (n = 240  8%) had normal OBP and elevated HBP indicating masked hypertension (MH). Thus  1 078 (35%  groups 2 and 4) were untreated or insufficiently treated. Awareness of hypertension was registered in 950 patients (31%) and of these 49% had a normal HBP. This is the first large-scale study to eliminate completely reporting bias by using telemedical transmission of BP data. One third of citizens in the age group 55-64 years had an abnormally high HBP  and one fourth either had WCH or MH. ClinicalTrials.gov identification number: NCT02355392.
Public Health,,,Infectious Diseases  Urbanization and Climate Change: Challenges in Future China. China is one of the largest countries in the world with nearly 20% of the world's population. There have been significant improvements in economy  education and technology over the last three decades. Due to substantial investments from all levels of government  the public health system in China has been improved since the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. However  infectious diseases still remain a major population health issue and this may be exacerbated by rapid urbanization and unprecedented impacts of climate change. This commentary aims to explore China's current capacity to manage infectious diseases which impair population health. It discusses the existing disease surveillance system and underscores the critical importance of strengthening the system. It also explores how the growing migrant population  dramatic changes in the natural landscape following rapid urbanization  and changing climatic conditions can contribute to the emergence and re-emergence of infectious disease. Continuing research on infectious diseases  urbanization and climate change may inform the country's capacity to deal with emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in the future.
Gynecology,,,The effect of dyad versus individual simulation-based ultrasound training on skills transfer. Dyad practice may be as effective as individual practice during clinical skills training  improve students' confidence  and reduce costs of training. However  there is little evidence that dyad training is non-inferior to single-student practice in terms of skills transfer. This study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of simulation-based ultrasound training in pairs (dyad practice) with that of training alone (single-student practice) on skills transfer. In a non-inferiority trial  30 ultrasound novices were randomised to dyad (n = 16) or single-student (n = 14) practice. All participants completed a 2-hour training programme on a transvaginal ultrasound simulator. Participants in the dyad group practised together and took turns as the active practitioner  whereas participants in the single group practised alone. Performance improvements were evaluated through pre-  post- and transfer tests. The transfer test involved the assessment of a transvaginal ultrasound scan by one of two clinicians using the Objective Structured Assessment of Ultrasound Skills (OSAUS). Thirty participants completed the simulation-based training and 24 of these completed the transfer test. Dyad training was found to be non-inferior to single-student training: transfer test OSAUS scores were significantly higher than the pre-specified non-inferiority margin (delta score 7.8%  95% confidence interval -3.8-19.6%; p = 0.04). More dyad (71.4%) than single (30.0%) trainees achieved OSAUS scores above a pre-established pass/fail level in the transfer test (p = 0.05). There were significant differences in performance scores before and after training in both groups (pre- versus post-test  p < 0.01) with large effect sizes (Cohen's d = 3.85) and no significant interactions between training type and performance (p = 0.59). The dyad group demonstrated higher training efficiency in terms of simulator score per number of attempts compared with the single-student group (p = 0.03). Dyad practice improves the efficiency of simulation-based training and is non-inferior to individual practice in terms of skills transfer.
Pathology,,,Coronary artery anomalies in Turner Syndrome. Congenital heart disease  primarily involving the left-sided structures  is often seen in patients with Turner Syndrome. Moreover  a few case reports have indicated that coronary anomalies may be more prevalent in Turner Syndrome than in the normal population. We therefore set out to systematically investigate coronary arterial anatomy by computed tomographic coronary angiography (coronary CTA) in Turner Syndrome patients. Fifty consecutive women with Turner Syndrome (mean age 47 years [17-71]) underwent coronary CTA. Patients were compared with 25 gender-matched controls. Coronary anomaly was more frequent in patients with Turner Syndrome than in healthy controls [20% vs. 4% (p = 0.043)]. Nine out of ten abnormal cases had an anomalous left coronary artery anatomy (absent left main trunk  n = 7; circumflex artery originating from the right aortic sinus  n = 2). One case had a tubular origin of the right coronary artery above the aortic sinus. There was no correlation between the presence of coronary arterial anomalies and karyotype  bicuspid aortic valve  or other congenital heart defects. Coronary anomalies are highly prevalent in Turner Syndrome. The left coronary artery is predominantly affected  with an absent left main coronary artery being the most common anomaly. No hemodynamically relevant coronary anomalies were found.
Rheumatology,,,Competencies in rheumatology: a European framework. The aims  structure  methods and educational experiences employed in the training of rheumatologists vary from one national programme to another  according to traditions  rules and resources. Mutual recognition of titles  the free movement of labour and the striving towards for high-quality standards in medical care in Europe demand that efforts and progress are made to ensure that similar competencies are achieved by different programmes. The European Rheumatology Curriculum Framework  developed by the European Board of Rheumatology  is meant to be a step towards the harmonization of rheumatology specialist training within the European Union  by providing a reference framework to the development and benchmarking of national curricula for the specialist training of rheumatologists. The European Rheumatology Curriculum Framework has now been endorsed by scientific and educational bodies in 17 member countries. It has been provided with a contextualized review of good practice in curriculum planning and development - the European Board of Rheumatology Educational Guide.
Family Practice,,,[Compliance of hypertension patients estimated by means of website tool]. The "Medicinprofilen" on the website www.sundhed.dk was introduced in 2004. This paper describes the application of this tool for the evaluation of compliance of patients in pharmacological treatment of hypertension in a general practice (single). Data about all patients with ICPC treatment code "K86 Ukompliceret hypertension"  who were undergoing pharmacological treatment was used for the study. (n=296). All patients should have been treated for at least 1 year up to the data collection period which took place in the second half of the year 2005. We found that the "Medicinprofilen" was a suitable tool to estimate compliance. Among the patients examined we found that compliance was 95% (92.4-97.4). The "Medicinprofilen" is a suitable tool to estimate compliance of patients undergoing pharmacological treatment in general practice. A few methodical problems exist. The study showed a high rate of compliance for the group of patients undergoing treatment of hypertension.
Family Practice,,,[Effects of new treatment criteria and goals in patients with high blood pressure in general practice]. This study examined the changes in detection and treatment of hypertension in a rural general practice after the introduction of new guidelines for treatment of hypertension published in 1999 by the Danish Hypertension Society. Data from all patients in practice diagnosed with hypertension on 1 October 1998 were registered (n = 200). By 1 October 2003  28 patients had left the cohort due to death (n = 26) or moving to other parts of the country (n = 2). For the remaining 172 patients  the blood pressure in 1998 and 2003 was found in the case record. The results of physical examinations  risk factors  morbidity rates and treatment were registered. In 1998  the average blood pressure in the study cohort was 157/89 mmHg. By 2003  it had fallen to 141/84 mmHg. The difference in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure was statistically significant (p < 0.001). In 1998  27 percent of the hypertensive patients in the cohort had reached the target value (< or = 140/90 mmHg). This percentage rose to 55 percent in 2003. The pattern of examinations concerning tracking down risk factors was markedly altered in the period. Pharmacological treatment had substantially increased during the period  with many more patients being treated with more than one drug. This study indicates that the introduction of new guidelines has caused considerable changes in the detection  risk evaluation and treatment of hypertension.
Epidemiology,Toxicology,,Post-mortem toxicology in young sudden cardiac death victims: A nationwide cohort study. Several drugs increase the risk of ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death (SCD). We aimed to investigate in detail the toxicological findings of all young SCD throughout Denmark. Deaths in persons aged 1-49 years were included over a 10-year period. Death certificates and autopsy reports were retrieved and read to identify cases of sudden death and establish cause of death. All medico-legal autopsied SCD were included and toxicological reports collected. Positive toxicology was defined as the presence of any substance (licit and/or illicit). All toxicological findings had previously been evaluated not to have caused the death (i.e. lethal concentrations were excluded). We identified 620 medico-legal autopsied cases of SCD  of which 77% (n = 477) were toxicologically investigated post-mortem  and 57% (n = 270) had a positive toxicology profile. Sudden cardiac death with positive toxicology had higher rates of sudden arrhythmic death syndrome (SADS)  compared with SCD with negative toxicology (56% vs. 42%  P < 0.01). In total  752 agents were detected  and polypharmacy (defined as the presence of more than one drug) was present in 61% (n = 164)  all substances combined. Psychotropic drugs were the most frequent (62%  n = 467)  and 82% (n = 385) were in pharmacological or subpharmacological levels. We found that more than half of all toxicologically investigated SCD victims have positive post-mortem toxicological findings  and polypharmacy is displayed in a considerable proportion. SCD with positive toxicology had higher rate of SADS  suggesting that the compounds may play a proarrhythmic role in these cases.
Forensic Pathology,,,Forensic postmortem computed tomography: volumetric measurement of the heart and liver. The purpose of this study was to investigate the utility of postmortem computed tomography (PMCT) images in estimating organ sizes and to examine the use of the cardiothoracic ratio (CTR). We included 45 individuals (19 females)  who underwent a medico-legal autopsy. Using the computer software program Mimics(®)  we determined in situ heart and liver volumes derived from linear measurements (width  height and depth) on a whole body PMCT-scan  and compared the volumes with ex vivo volumes derived by CT-scan of the eviscerated heart and liver. The ex vivo volumes were also compared with the organ weights. Further  we compared the CTR with the ex vivo heart volume and a heart weight-ratio (HWR). Intra- and inter-observer analyses were performed. We found no correlation between the in situ and ex vivo volumes of the heart and liver. However  a highly significant correlation was found between the ex vivo volumes and weights of the heart and liver. No correlations between CTR and the ex vivo heart volume nor with HWR was found. Concerning cardiomegaly  we found no agreement between the CTR and HWR. The intra- and inter-observer analyses showed no significant differences. Noninvasive in situ PMCT methods for organ measuring  as performed in this study  are not useful tools in forensic pathology. The best method to estimate organ volume is a CT-scan of the eviscerated organ. PMCT-determined CTR seems to be useless for ascertaining cardiomegaly  as it neither correlated with the ex vivo heart volume nor with the HWR.
Pathology  Molecular,,,Saffold virus infection associated with human myocarditis. Saffold virus was described in 2007 as one of the first human viruses within the genus cardioviruses. Cardioviruses may cause severe infections of the myocardium in animals  and several studies have associated saffold virus with human disease. As a result  saffold virus has been isolated from different anatomical compartments  including the myocardium  but  until now  it has not been possible to demonstrate the accompanying histopathological signs of inflammation. The aim of the study was to examine if saffold virus is capable of causing invasive infection in the human myocardium. Using real-time PCR  we retrospectively examined formalin-fixed paraffin embedded cardiac tissue specimens from 150 deceased individuals diagnosed with myocarditis at autopsy. The results were compared with histological findings. Saffold virus was detected in the myocardium  lung tissue and blood of one child and was accompanied by histopathological inflammation in the heart and lungs  which was supportive of a viral infection. These findings suggest that cardioviruses may be associated with myocarditis in humans.
Forensic Medicine,,,Fatal poisoning among patients with drug addiction. Fatal poisonings among drug addicts in Denmark in 2012 were examined. Cause of death  abuse pattern and geographic differences are discussed and data are compared with previous studies. All fatal poisonings examined at the three institutes of forensic medicine in Denmark in 2012 were included in the study. A total of 188 fatal intoxications were recorded. The median age increased from 37.5 in 2007 to 41.5 in 2012. The majority were men (77%). Methadone (59%) was the main intoxicant. The decrease in the frequency of heroin/morphine deaths since 1997 (71%) continued  declining to 44% in 2002  33% in 2007 and finally to 27% in 2012. Few deaths from central stimulants (amphetamine and cocaine) occurred. Multiple drug use was common and consisted mainly of opioids  cocaine  amphetamine  cannabis  benzodiazepines and alcohol. Heroin/morphine use was most frequent on Funen and in South Jutland. Cocaine was most frequently detected in East Denmark  while amphetamine was more frequent in West Denmark. The number of fatal poisonings among drug addicts has stabilised around 200. The increase in methadone deaths continued and  as in 2007  methadone was the main intoxicant. The increase in methadone deaths seems to be associated with use of methadone in substitution treatment. Nevertheless  methadone treatment also seems to save lives  as indicated by the increasing median age. Use of antidepressants and antipsychotics increased to a high level compared with 2007  indicating that a considerable number of drug addicts also have psychiatric illness. none. not relevant.
Forensic Pathology,,,Does β-APP staining of the brain in infant bed-sharing deaths differentiate these cases from sudden infant death syndrome? Archival cerebral tissue from infants whose deaths were attributed to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) from South Australia and Western Denmark were stained for β-amyloid precursor protein (β-APP) and graded according to a simple scoring chart. The resulting APP scores were correlated with sleeping situation (shared vs. alone) showing a significantly higher amount of β-APP staining in the non-bed-sharing  than in the bed-sharing infants (Mann-Whitney  Australia: p = 0.0128  Denmark: p = 0.0014  Combined: p = 0.0031). There was also a marked but non-significant difference in sex distribution between bed-sharers and non-bed-sharers with a male to female ratio of 1:1 in the first group and 2:1 in the latter. Of 48 Australian and 76 Danish SIDS infants  β-APP staining was present in 116 (94%) cases. The eight negative cases were all from the Danish cohort. This study has shown that the amount of β-APP staining was significantly higher in infants who were sleeping alone compared to those who were bed-sharing with one or more adults  in both an Australian and Danish cohort of SIDS infants. Whether this results from differences in the speed with which these infants die  differences in lethal mechanisms involving possible accidental asphyxiation in shared sleepers  or differences in the number of previous hypoxic-ischemic events  remains to be clarified.
Forensic Genetics,,,DNA and RNA analysis of blood and muscle from bodies with variable postmortem intervals. The breakdown of DNA and RNA in decomposing human tissue represents a major obstacle for postmortem forensic molecular analysis. This study investigated the feasibility of performing PCR-based molecular analysis of blood and muscle tissue from 45 autopsy cases with defined postmortem intervals ranging from one to more than 14 days. It was not possible to collect blood from 38 % of the autopsy cases due to severe coagulation and hemolysis  whereas muscle tissue was available for all cases. PCR-amplifiable DNA could be extracted from 96 % of the frozen muscle specimens and from 93 % of the formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) muscle specimens. A quality assessment of muscle-derived DNA showed increased fragmentation with advancing body decomposition and generally more fragmentation in DNA from FFPE tissue than in DNA from frozen tissue. It was possible to amplify 1 000 basepair (bp) DNA fragments from all samples with postmortem intervals below 3 days whereas 400-600 bp long fragments typically could be amplified from the most decomposed muscle specimens. RNA was less stable than DNA in postmortem muscle tissue  yet selected mRNA molecules could be detected by reverse-transcriptase PCR in all samples up to 3 days after death. We conclude that analysis of DNA from bodies with a wide postmortem interval range is usually possible whereas the consistency of RNA analyses decreases considerably 3 days postmortem. We showed that muscle tissue is a highly usable source of DNA and RNA for postmortem forensic molecular analysis as well as for retrospective research projects based on archived FFPE specimens.
Forensic Genetics,,,The presence of enterovirus  adenovirus  and parvovirus B19 in myocardial tissue samples from autopsies: an evaluation of their frequencies in deceased individuals with myocarditis and in non-inflamed control hearts. Multiple viruses have been detected in cardiac tissue  but their role in causing myocarditis remains controversial. Viral diagnostics are increasingly used in forensic medicine  but the interpretation of the results can sometimes be challenging. In this study  we examined the prevalence of adenovirus  enterovirus  and parvovirus B19 (PVB) in myocardial autopsy samples from myocarditis related deaths and in non-inflamed control hearts in an effort to clarify their significance as the causes of myocarditis in a forensic material. We collected all autopsy cases diagnosed with myocarditis from 1992 to 2010. Eighty-four suicidal deaths with morphologically normal hearts served as controls. Polymerase chain reaction was used for the detection of the viral genomes (adenovirus  enterovirus  and PVB) in myocardial tissue specimens. The distinction between acute and persistent PVB infection was made by the serological determination of PVB-specific immunoglobulins M and G. PVB was detected in 33 of 112 (29 %) myocarditis cases and 37 of 84 (44 %) control cases. All of the samples were negative for the presence of adenovirus and enterovirus. Serological evidence of an acute PVB infection  determined by the presence of immunoglobulin M  was only present in one case. In the remaining cases  PVB was considered to be a bystander with no or limited association to myocardial inflammation. In this study  adenovirus  enterovirus  and PVB were found to be rare causes of myocarditis. The detection of PVB in myocardial autopsy samples most likely represents a persistent infection with no or limited association with myocardial inflammation. The forensic investigation of myocardial inflammation demands a thorough examination  including special attention to non-viral causes and requires a multidisciplinary approach.
Forensic Pathology,,,Fatal lawn mower related projectile injury. Fatal lawn mower related injuries are a relatively rare occurrence. In a forensic setting  the primary aim is to reconstruct the injury mechanism and establish the cause of death. A relatively rare  but characteristic type of injury is a so-called projectile or missile injury. This occurs when the operator or a bystander is impacted by an object mobilized from the grass by the rotating mower blades. This type of injury often leaves only modest external trauma  which increases the risk of overlooking an entry wound. In this paper we present a case of a fatal lawn mower related projectile injury which was initially overlooked  later interpreted as a possible gunshot homicide  and finally identified as a lawn mower related projectile injury when autopsy revealed a piece of metal thread in the main bronchus to the right middle lobe  hemopericardium  and right-sided hemothorax. To our knowledge  this injury mechanism has not previously been reported as a cause of death. This case illustrates the importance of postmortem radiological imaging and interdisciplinary cooperation when establishing manner and cause of death in unusual cases.
Forensic Pathology,,,Quantitative diagnosis of lymphocytic myocarditis in forensic medicine. The aim of this study was to establish quantitative diagnostic criteria for lymphocytic myocarditis on autopsy samples by using a stereological cell profile counting method. We quantified and compared the presence of lymphocytes and macrophages in myocardial autopsy specimens from 112 deceased individuals who had been diagnosed with myocarditis according to the Dallas criteria and 86 control subjects with morphologically normal hearts. We found the mean number to be 52.7 lymphocyte profiles/mm(2) (range 3.7-946; standard deviation 131) in the myocarditis group and 9.7 (range 2.1-25.9; standard deviation 4.6) in the control group. The cut-off value for the diagnosis of myocarditis was determined by calculating sensitivity plus specificity  which reached the highest combination at 13 lymphocyte profiles/mm(2) (sensitivity 68%; specificity 83%). A considerable proportion of subjects in both the myocarditis and control groups had lymphocyte profile counts below 30/mm(2)  representing a diagnostic challenge due to the increased risk of creating false negative or false positive results. We found it practically impossible to obtain a reliable macrophage count. The present data add new important information on lymphocyte counts in inflamed and non-inflamed myocardium. We suggest a cut-off value in the range of 11-16 lymphocyte profiles/mm(2) for a reliable diagnosis of lymphocytic myocarditis from autopsy samples. To evaluate small inflammatory changes at low lymphocyte counts  a multidisciplinary approach should be implemented  in which diagnostic tools are used ancillary to histological examination. We advise against semi-quantification of macrophages based on cell profile counting.
Forensic Pathology,,,Autopsy practice in forensic pathology - evidence-based or experience-based? a review of autopsies performed on victims of traumatic asphyxia in a mass disaster. Current autopsy practice in forensic pathology is to a large extent based on experience and individual customary practices as opposed to evidence and consensus based practices. As a result there is the potential for substantial variation in how knowledge is applied in each case. In the present case series  we describe the variation observed in autopsy reports by five different pathologists of eight victims who died simultaneously from traumatic asphyxia due to compression during a human stampede. We observed that there was no mention of the availability of medical charts in five of the reports  of potentially confounding resuscitation efforts in three reports  of cardinal signs in seven reports and of associated injuries to a various degree in all reports. Further  there was mention of supplemental histological examination in two reports and of pre-autopsy radiograph in six reports. We inferred that reliance on experience and individual customary practices led to disparities between the autopsy reports as well as omissions of important information such as cardinal signs  and conclude that such reliance increases the potential for error in autopsy practice. We suggest that pre-autopsy data-gathering and the use of check lists specific to certain injury causes are likely to result in less deviation from evidence-based practices in forensic pathology. Pre-autopsy data-gathering and check lists will help ensure a higher degree of standardization in autopsy reports thus enhancing the quality and accuracy of the report as a legal document as well as rendering it more useful for data-gathering efforts.
Forensic Pathology,,,Characteristics of human infant primary fibroblast cultures from Achilles tendons removed post-mortem. Primary cell cultures were investigated as a tool for molecular diagnostics in a forensic setting. Fibroblast cultures had been established from human Achilles tendon resected at autopsies  from cases of sudden infant death syndrome and control infants who died in traumatic events (n=41). After isolation of primary cultures cells were stored at -135°C  and re-established up to 15 years later for experimental intervention. Growth characteristics in cultures were evaluated in relation to the age of the donor  the post mortem interval before sampling  and the storage interval of cells before entry into the study. High interpersonal variation in growth rates and cell doubling time was seen  but no statistically significant differences were found with increasing age of the donor (mean 19 weeks)  length of post-mortem interval prior to sampling (6-100 h)  or increase in years of storage. Fibroblast cultures established from post-mortem tissue are renewable sources of biological material; they can be the foundation for genetic  metabolic and other functional studies and thus constitute a valuable tool for molecular and pathophysiological investigations in biomedical and forensic sciences.
Forensic Genetics,Forensic Pathology,,Heat stress and sudden infant death syndrome--stress gene expression after exposure to moderate heat stress. The aim of the present study was to investigate stress gene expression in cultured primary fibroblasts established from Achilles tendons collected during autopsies from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) cases  and age-matched controls (infants dying in a traumatic event). Expression of 4 stress responsive genes  HSPA1B  HSPD1  HMOX1  and SOD2  was studied by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR analysis of RNA purified from cells cultured under standard or various thermal stress conditions. The expression of all 4 genes was highly influenced by thermal stress in both SIDS and control cells. High interpersonal variance found in the SIDS group indicated that they represented a more heterogeneous group than controls. The SIDS group responded to thermal stress with a higher expression of the HSPA1B and HSPD1 genes compared to the control group  whereas no significant difference was observed in the expression of SOD2 and HMOX1 between the two groups. The differences were related to the heat shock treatment as none of the genes were expressed significantly different in SIDS at base levels at 37 °C. SOD2 and HMOX1 were up regulated in both groups  for SOD2 though the expression was lower in SIDS at all time points measured  and may be less related to heat stress. Being found dead in the prone position (a known risk factor for SIDS) was related to a lower HSPA1B up-regulation in SIDS compared to SIDS found on their side or back. The study demonstrates the potential usefulness of gene expression studies using cultured fibroblasts established from deceased individuals as a tool for molecular and pathological investigations in forensic and biomedical sciences.
General Practice,,,Alarm symptoms of soft-tissue and bone sarcoma in patients referred to a specialist center. The Danish Cancer Patient Pathway for sarcoma defines a set of alarm symptoms as criteria for referral to a sarcoma center. This may exclude cancer patients without alarm symptoms  so we investigated the presence of alarm symptoms (defined as being indicative of a sarcoma) in patients who had been referred to the Aarhus Sarcoma Center. We reviewed the medical records of all 1 126 patients who had been referred  with suspected sarcoma  from other hospitals in the period 2007-2010 for information on symptoms  clinical findings  and diagnosis. Alarm symptoms were analyzed for predictive values in diagnosing sarcoma. 179 (69%) of 258 sarcoma patients were referred with alarm symptoms (soft-tissue tumor>5 cm or deep-seated  fast-growing soft-tissue tumor  palpable bone tumor  or deep persisting bone pain). The remaining 79 sarcomas were found accidentally. "Size over 5 cm" for soft-tissue tumors  and "deep persisting bone pain" for bone tumors had the highest sensitivity and positive predictive value. Of the 79 sarcoma patients who were referred without alarm symptoms  7 were found accidentally on imaging  5 were referred with suspected recurrence of a sarcoma  64 were referred with a confirmed histological diagnosis  and 3 were referred for other reasons. Defined alarm symptoms are predictive of sarcoma  but one-third of the patients were found accidentally. Further studies on presenting symptoms in primary care are needed to assess the true value of alarm symptoms.
Pharmacogenetics,,,The Gly16 Allele of the Gly16Arg Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism in the β₂-Adrenergic Receptor Gene Augments Perioperative Use of Vasopressors: A Retrospective Cohort Study. Arterial hypotension is frequent in patients undergoing anesthesia and may aggravate the outcome. Common genetic variations may influence the cardiovascular response to anesthesia. In this retrospective cohort study  we tested whether variation in the gene encoding the β2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) influences perioperative arterial blood pressure and consequently the use of vasopressors. Five hundred seventy-one Danish Caucasians undergoing neurosurgery were genotyped for 5 marker single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within ADRB2 (Gly16Arg  Gln27Glu  Thr164Ile  Arg175Arg  and Gly351Gly). A pairwise tagging principle was used to identify ADRB2 haplotypes. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was recorded in the supine awake state and  together with administration of vasopressors (ephedrine and/or phenylephrine)  for 30 minutes after induction of general anesthesia (sevoflurane/remifentanil or propofol/remifentanil). Four hundred thirteen (72%) patients received ephedrine and/or phenylephrine. Only baseline MAP (P < 0.001) and the Arg175Arg SNP (P = 0.01) were associated with nadir perioperative MAP. The Gly16Arg SNP but no other SNPs showed a trend toward an association with the amount of vasopressors used during anesthesia with Arg16 homozygotes receiving less ephedrine equivalents. The Arg16-Gln27-Thr164-Arg175-Gly351 haplotype was associated with approximately 13% lower vasopressor requirements than the most common Gly16-Glu27-Thr164-Arg175-Gly351 haplotype (P = 0.01). Gly16 carriers received larger amounts of vasopressor compared with Arg16 homozygotes. This corresponds to previous studies demonstrating that the Gly16 allele in ADRB2 is associated with vasodilation and high cardiac output.
Cardiology,Epidemiology,,Increased discordance between HeartScore and coronary artery calcification score after introduction of the new ESC prevention guidelines. The European HeartScore has traditionally differentiated between low and high-risk countries. Until 2012 Germany and Denmark were considered to be high-risk countries but have now been defined as low-risk countries. In this survey we aim to address the consequences of this downgrading. A screening of 3932 randomly selected (mean age 56 years  46% male) individuals from Germany and Denmark free of cardiovascular disease was performed. Traditional risk factors were determined  and the HeartScore was measured using both the low-risk and the high-risk country models. A non-contrast Cardiac-CT scan was performed to detect coronary artery calcification (CAC). Agreement of HeartScore risk groups with CAC groups was poor  but higher when applying the algorithm for the low-risk compared to the high-risk country model (agreement rate: 77% versus 63%  and weighted Kappa: 0.22 versus 0.15). However  the number of subjects with severe coronary calcification (CAC score ≥400) increased in the low and intermediate HeartScore risk group from 78 to 147 participants (from 2.7 % to 4.2 %  p = 0.001)  when estimating the risk based on the algorithm for low-risk countries. As a consequence of the reclassification of Germany and Denmark as low-risk countries more people with severe atherosclerosis will be classified as having a low or intermediate risk of fatal cardiovascular disease.
Pediatrics,,,Use of patient video cases in medical education. Patient video cases (PVCs) are brief video recordings of patients during spontaneous or instructed activity. PVCs are true to life and can be replayed  enabling the establishment of highly interactive  contextual and safe learning environments  with a minimum of facilitation. This article describes the use of workshops in which PVCs are used to assist with the development of observational skills and clinical reasoning in medical students and postgraduates. We describe why PVCs are a valuable addition to an educator's portfolio of resources  what evidence there is for their effectiveness  how to use videos for teaching  and some practical advice and tips on their collection and storage.
Neurology,Pediatrics,,Visual expertise in paediatric neurology. Visual expertise relies on perceptive as well as cognitive processes. At present  knowledge of these processes when diagnosing clinical cases mainly stems from studies with still pictures. In contrast  patient video cases constitute a dynamic diagnostic challenge that may simulate seeing and diagnosing a patient in person. This study investigates visual attention and the concomitant cognitive processes of clinicians diagnosing authentic paediatric video cases. A total of 43 clinicians with varying levels of expertise took part in this cross-sectional study. They diagnosed four brief video recordings of children: two with seizures and two with disorders imitating seizures. We used eye tracking to investigate time looking at relevant areas in the video cases and a concurrent think-aloud procedure to explore the associated clinical reasoning processes. More experienced clinicians were more accurate in visual diagnosis and spent more of their time looking at relevant areas. At the same time  they explored data less  yet they built and evaluated more diagnostic hypotheses. Clinicians of varying expertise analyse patient video cases differently. Clinical teachers should take these differences into account when optimising educational formats with patient video cases.
Neurology,Pediatrics,,Enhancing diagnostic accuracy among nonexperts through use of video cases. The goal was to determine whether the diagnostic accuracy of nonexperts in selected learning environments would improve with the use of patient video cases (PVCs). We designed a stepwise  team-based  learning approach with a (1) text-based patient presentation  (2) first review of a PVC  (3) small-group discussion  (4) second review of a PVC  and (5) large-group discussion and listening to think-aloud modeling by a content expert. Four pediatric neurology PVCs were analyzed by 44 physicians. After each step  the diagnostic accuracy was assessed with a questionnaire with open-ended questions measuring the frequency of relevant diagnoses and clinical diagnostic reasoning processes. The first review of the PVC was followed by a large number of relevant clinical diagnostic reasoning processes. Small-group discussions and listening to a think-aloud procedure with an expert were particularly effective in increasing the diagnostic accuracy of the nonexperts. The diagnostic accuracy of nonexperts was clearly enhanced by interaction in small-group discussions and subsequent listening to a think-aloud procedure with a content expert. Learning through PVCs in clinical settings thus is improved through the interactive participation of junior and senior clinicians. Such an environment (a "virtual examination room") may be introduced at grand rounds  case conferences  or morning rounds  to stimulate the development of diagnostic accuracy in nonexperts.
General Practice,,,Predictors of weight loss in young adults who are over-weight or obese and have psychosocial problems: a post hoc analysis. The aim of this study is in a general practice trial setting to identify predictive factors for weight loss after 1 year among young adults who are over-weight or obese and who have several psychosocial problems. Twenty-eight general practitioners recruited 495 patients aged 20-45 years with psychosocial problems for a randomized general preventive study to increase self-efficacy to achieve a self-prioritised goal for a better life by discussions of resources and barriers for reaching the goal. The present study is a post hoc analysis of possible predictors of weight loss among all 218 patients who have over-weight or obesity. A 23-pages questionnaire was completed before and 1 year after randomization. 111 patients had a one-hour preventive health consultation with their general practitioners focused on life coaching and a follow-up consultation within 3 months  and 107 patients had no preventive consultation. Twenty-two patients stated during the preventive consultation that weight loss was a prioritised goal. They had a mean weight loss of 4.7 kgs compared with 1.6 kgs in the group without this goal and 1.6 kgs in the group without preventive consultation. In a logistic regression model  predictors of weight loss or no weight loss were a) pre-interventional consideration of weight loss within 30 days  b) having weight loss as a prioritised goal for improved quality of life  c) being female  d) being in the oldest half of participants  and e) having many psychosocial problems. In a linear regression model  the predictors together explained about 11% of the weight loss. Important predictors were: obesity (explained 4%)  pre-interventional consideration of weight loss within 30 days (3%)  and having a preventive health consultation with weight loss as a prioritised goal (2%). Pre-interventional consideration of weight loss within 30 days and having weight loss as a prioritised goal during the health consultation were two important predictors for weight loss. By structured interventions focussing on the patients' priorities  self-chosen goals  their resources and barriers for reaching the goals  changes may be obtained; especially in participants with many problems who often do not accept participation in procedures on risks. NCT 01231256   Aug. 22. 2010.
Family Practice,,,The importance of gender of patients and general practitioners in relation to treatment practices for overweight. Several studies suggest that men and women are treated differently for similar disease including diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Differences in attitudes and treatment practices towards men and women with obesity are not well recognized. To investigate the attitudes and treatment practices among Danish general practitioners (GPs)  in relation to treatment of overweight  while taking gender of both the patients and practitioners into account. Questionnaire inventory covertly examining attitudes and practices among Danish general practitioners towards treatment of overweight. All 3.637 general practitioners from the Danish Medical Association register were invited to participate in the survey. In total 1.136 participated. The GPs found weight loss to be more important for overweight male than overweight female patients. They also treated complications to overweight more rigorously among male than female patients  and recommended lipid lowering medicine more often to male than female overweight patients. In addition  the younger female GPs and older male GPs more often said that they would treat an overweight patient with lipid lowering medicine. Among general practitioners in Denmark  treatment for weight loss is more often practiced for overweight male than overweight female patients presenting with same symptoms. In addition  hyperlipidemia among overweight males is also more often treated with lipid lowering medicine than hyperlipidemia among overweight females.
General Practice,,,Use of tympanometry in general practice in Denmark. Otitis media has been a serious disease and can be that even today. The diagnosis of otitis media is often difficult. Pneumatic otoscopy  otomicroscopy  and tympanometry can improve the diagnostic quality by indication of fluid in the middle ear and thereby improve the quality of treatment. The aim of this ongoing study is to analyze the use of tympanometry in Denmark after reimbursement for doing tympanometry (November 2006) when clinically indicated. Our research questions were: How many clinics were using tympanometry? How frequent was it used? Is the use increasing? Has the number of GPs in the clinic any relation to the use of tympanometry? We used information in The Danish National Health Service in three Regions to analyze the use of tympanometry in general practice during the years 2007-2009. The coverage of the GPs is 100% in the regions. The three regions counted about half of Danish population. In 2009 the material was 902 different clinics with more than 1700 GPs. In 2007 55% of the clinics did tympanometry  in 2009 the figure was 60%. In the clinics doing tympanometry the median value was 28 tympanometries per year (inter-quartile range 13-53) per GP. The variation in the use of tympanometry was surprisingly high  from none or a few per GP per year to a maximum of more than 500 tympanometric examinations per GP a year. This huge variation has to be discussed. Many answers can be given. Some of the explanation was problems in doing correct tympanometry  and problems understand the clinical implications of curves and the figures.
General Practice,,,Tympanometry in general practice: use  problems and solutions. The diagnosis in children with middle ear symptoms is often difficult. Tympanometry is recommended as a supplementary diagnostic tool with a high predictive value for fluid or no fluid in the middle ear. The aim of this study was to examine how tympanometry was used in Danish general practice in 2009  to report common problems general practitioners (GPs) and GP nurses encounter in tympanometry and to evaluate the effect of a practical and theoretical course. A 1-year registration of the use of tympanometry in the Danish National Health Service Register in two regions with 40% of all Danish GPs and a survey among 197 participants in a course on diagnosis of otitis media and tympanometry in children were used. The Danish National Health Insurance covers 100% of GPs because they administer reimbursement for their activities  including tympanometry. During the year 2009  1433 GPs in 702 clinics were on the list. A total of 417 clinics performed 35 529 tympanometries. Some 285 clinics (40.6%) did not perform tympanometry in 2009. The active clinics performed 42 tympanometries per GP. A 1-day course improved the knowledge and practical skills of the participating GPs and nurses. A majority (70%) stated in a self-reported questionnaire that tympanometry often provided important information  especially about middle ear fluid  and 48% reported that tympanometry several times during the past 2 weeks had changed their management of a middle ear problem. Few had not used their tympanometer during the 2 weeks preceding the survey. The response rate was 72%. The use of tympanometry is very skewed. A 6-hour course could improve GPs' care of patients with middle ear problems by using tympanometry.
General Practice,,,The effect of preventive consultations on young adults with psychosocial problems: a randomized trial. Patients with many problems often face difficulties in modifying their behavior as desired. Uncovered basic needs may be an important barrier. This research tests the effect of patient-centered consultations for 20- to 44-year-old patients with multiple psychosocial and lifestyle problems. We focus on resources and barriers for obtaining self-chosen goals within life circumstances and lifestyle. At 28 general practitioners  2056 patients aged 20-44 years were screened with a 33-item problem-score on resources  network  lifestyle and social conditions. The 30% who had most problems were invited to complete a more comprehensive questionnaire at home. Intervention was preventive consultation with a 3-month follow-up. A total of 495 patients were randomized. One-year questionnaire follow-up showed significant improvement in Short Form Health-related Quality of Life Mental (MCS-SF12) in the intervention group (7.3) compared with the control group (3.0); the difference was 4.3 (95% confidence interval 1.6-7.0  P = 0.002). The number of problems was reduced significantly more in the intervention than in the control group (1.8 versus 0.8  P = 0.03). Preventive consultation focusing on resources and barriers to self-chosen goals may improve MCS-SF12 and decrease the number of problems in patients with many psychosocial and lifestyle problems. This may be an indicator of improved specific self-efficacy and a key to lifestyle changes.
Otolaryngology,,,Social marginalization reduces use of ENT physicians in primary care. The aim of this study was to explore the association between social marginalization of the mothers and their children's use of the healthcare system and ear-nose-throat (ENT) physicians in the year 2009 in a region of Denmark. A regional register-based cross-sectional study of use of healthcare services among children (n=10 232) of marginalized mothers and children (n=101 582) of non-marginalized mothers in the North Denmark Region. Social marginalization was defined as having received public social benefits for more than 80% of the year. Children with a marginalized mother had more chronic medical diagnoses (OR=1.22  95% confidence interval 1.17-1.28)  they had more frequently been in contact with their general practitioner during the year  and they used the healthcare system more often than children of non-marginalized mothers  except in the case of ENT specialists (OR=0.90  0.85-0.95)  and they had more seldom tympanostomy tubes inserted (OR=0.75  0.66-0.87). The distance between ENT-clinic and place of residence of the patients had only a small effect on the use of ENT-physician  and only significant in the non-marginalized. Children of marginalized mothers used the healthcare system more than other children  except in case of ENT-physicians. They had fewer ENT-consultations and had less frequently inserted tympanostomy tubes when they attended the surgery.
Pharmacogenetics,Precision Medicine,,Pharmacogenetics and the print media: what is the public told? Pharmacogenetics is a rapidly growing field that aims to identify the genes that influence drug response. This science can be used as a powerful tool to tailor drug treatment to the genetic makeup of individuals. The present study explores the coverage of the topic of pharmacogenetics and its potential benefit in personalised medicine by the UK newsprint media. The LexisNexis database was used to identify and retrieve full text articles from the 10 highest circulation national daily newspapers and their Sunday equivalents in the UK. Content analysis of newspaper articles which referenced pharmacogenetic testing was carried out. A second researcher coded a random sample (21%) of newspaper articles to establish the inter-rater reliability of coding. Of the 256 articles captured by the search terms  96 articles (with pharmacogenetics as a major component) met the study inclusion criteria. The majority of articles over-stated the benefits of pharmacogenetic testing while paying less attention to the associated risks. Overall beneficial effects were mentioned 5.3 times more frequently than risks (p < 0.001). The most common illnesses for which pharmacogenetically based personalised medicine was discussed were cancer  cardiovascular disease and CNS diseases. Only 13% of newspaper articles that cited a specific scientific study mentioned this link in the article. There was a positive correlation between the size of the article and both the number of benefits and risks stated (P < 0.01). More comprehensive coverage of the area of personalised medicine within the print media is needed to inform public debate on the inclusion of pharmacogentic testing in routine practice.
Family Practice,,,Prospective evaluation of the quality of oral anticoagulation management in an outpatient clinic and in general practices. To compare the quality of oral anticoagulant therapy (QOAT)  before and after referral of patients on oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT) from a hospital outpatient clinic (HOC) to general practitioners (GPs). Prospective observational study. Patients were identified by using the Laboratory Information System (LIS)  containing all prescribed International Normalised Ratio of Prothrombin Time (INR) tests  from the HOC and GPs in the hospital submission area. The HOC in a rural hospital  Aarhus County  Denmark (55 000 inhabitants)  and GPs in the submission area. 124 OAT patients (59.7% males. Median age 70.0: 25-75 percentile: 62.0-76.0). The QOAT in terms of time spent within therapeutic INR interval (TI). The QOAT was compared 8 months before with 8 months after altering the monitoring organization. For patients monitored less than 8 months before the alteration  the QOAT was compared to a corresponding time period after the alteration. We identified 124 OAT patients  and found a significant increase in the QOAT from 65.0% before to 69.1% after referral of the patients to the GPs (P<.0001). In 75 patients with full follow-up  the QOAT increased from 67.5% before to 69.7% after the alteration (P<.0001). The results indicate that the QOAT in this geographical area is adequate  and that the quality performed by the GPs was at least as good as in the HOC. In order to document and increase the QOAT  continuous quality surveillance using the LIS has been initiated.
Pharmacogenetics,,,A molecular pathway analysis of the glutamatergic-monoaminergic interplay serves to investigate the number of depressive records during citalopram treatment. The efficacy of current antidepressant (AD) drugs for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) lays behind expectations. The correct genetic differentiation between severe and less severe cases before treatment may pave the way to the most correct clinical choices in clinical practice. Genetics may pave the way such identification  which in turns may provide perspectives for the synthesis of new ADs by correcting the molecular unbalances that differentiate severe and less severe depressive patients. We investigated 1 903 MDD patients from the STAR*D study. Outcome was the number of severe depressive records  defined as a Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS)-Clinician rated (C) total score >15  corrected for the number of observations for each patient during the first 14 weeks of citalopram treatment. Predictors were the genetic variations harbored by genes involved in the glutamatergic-monoaminergic interplay as defined in a previous work published by our group. Clinical and socio-demographic stratification factor analyses were taken in cases and controls. Covariated linear regression was the statistical model for the analysis. SNPs were analyzed in groups (molecular pathway analysis) testing the hypothesis that the distribution of significant (p < 0.05) associations between SNPs and the outcome segregates within each pathway/gene subset. The best associated results are relative to two signle SNPs  (rs7744492 in AKAP12 p = 0.0004 and rs17046113 in CAMK2D p = 0.0006) and a molecular pathway (cAMP biosynthetic process p = 0.005). After correction for multitesting  none of them resulted to be significantly associated. These results are consistent with previous findings in literature and further stress that the molecular mechanisms targeted by current ADs may not be the key biological variables that differentiate severe from mild depression.
Pharmacogenetics,,,AKAP13  CACNA1  GRIK4 and GRIA1 genetic variations may be associated with haloperidol efficacy during acute treatment. We previously investigated a sample of psychotic patients acutely ill and acutely treated with haloperidol in the search for genetic predictors of response at PANSS scores during the first month of treatment. In the present work we extend the analysis to a wider panel of genetic variations including SNPs harbored by genes whose products are involved in molecular pathways consistent with the latest results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of antipsychotic efficacy. 96 Patients were investigated. The results were replicated in an independent sample of bipolar manic patients treated with antipsychotics (n tot=470  the sample was retrieved from the STEP-BD). Outcomes were the PANSS variation through time in the first sample  and changes of mania symptomatology at any two consecutive observations in the public available STEP-BD replication sample. A list of variations harbored by AKAP13  CACNA1  GRIK4 and GRIA1 were found to be significantly associated with outcome in both samples (different set of variations for each sample). Results did not survived multiple testing in the original sample but were replicated in both samples. This finding stresses the relevance of the glutamatergic system and regulatory molecular cascades in antipsychotic response. Nonetheless  the level of significance and the indirect and incomplete replication mandate cautiousness and further replication.
Evidence-Based Medicine,General Practice,,[Clinical guidelines for antithrombotic therapy of patients with atrial fibrillation can be implemented in general practice by means of data capture]. Suboptimal treatment with oral anticoagulation therapy of atrial fibrillation is well-documented. The use of clinical guidelines and databases in general practice can improve adherence to the guidelines stipulated by the Danish Society of Cardiology. However  guidelines should be updated continuously  and in approximately 20% of our patients the application of oral anticoagulation therapy turned out to be problematic  even though they had a high thromboembolic risk score.
Pharmacology  Clinical,,,The effect of systematic medication review in elderly patients admitted to an acute ward of internal medicine. Elderly patients are vulnerable to medication errors and adverse drug events due to increased morbidity  polypharmacy and inappropriate interactions. The objective of this study was to investigate whether systematic medication review and counselling performed by a clinical pharmacist and clinical pharmacologist would reduce length of in-hospital stay in elderly patients admitted to an acute ward of internal medicine. A randomized  controlled study of 100 patients aged 70 years or older was conducted in an acute ward of internal medicine in Denmark. Intervention arm: a clinical pharmacist conducted systematic medication reviews after an experienced medical physician had prescribed the patients' medication. Information was collected from medical charts  interview with the patients and database registrations of drug purchase. Subsequently  medication histories were conferred with a clinical pharmacologist and advisory notes recommending medication changes were completed. Physicians were not obliged to comply with the recommendations. Control arm: medication was reviewed by usual routine in the ward. Primary end-point was length of in-hospital stay. In addition  readmissions  mortality  contact to primary healthcare and quality of life were measured at 3-month follow-up. In the intervention arm  the mean length of in-hospital stay was 239.9 hr (95% CI: 190.2-289.6) and in the control arm: 238.6 hr (95% CI: 137.6-339.6)  which was neither a statistical significant nor a clinically relevant difference. Moreover  no differences were observed for any of the secondary end-points. Systematic medication review and medication counselling did not show any effect on in-hospital length of stay in elderly patients when admitted to an acute ward of internal medicine.
Rheumatology,,,EULAR task force recommendations on annual cardiovascular risk assessment for patients with rheumatoid arthritis: an audit of the success of implementation in a rheumatology outpatient clinic. EULAR recommendations for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk management include annual CVD risk assessments for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We evaluated the recording of CVD risk factors (CVD-RF) in a rheumatology outpatient clinic  where EULAR recommendations had been implemented. Further  we compared CVD-RF recordings between a regular rheumatology outpatient clinic (RegROC) and a structured arthritis clinic (AC). In 2012  1142 RA patients visited the rheumatology outpatient clinic: 612 attended RegROC and 530 attended AC. We conducted a search in the patient journals to ascertain the rate of CVD-RF recording. The overall CVD-RF recording rate was 40.1% in the rheumatology outpatient clinic  reflecting a recording rate of 59.1% in the AC and 23.6% in the RegROC. The odds ratios for having CVD-RFs recorded for patients attending AC compared to RegROC were as follows: blood pressure: 12.4  lipids: 5.0-6.0  glucose: 9.1  HbA1c: 6.1  smoking: 1.4  and for having all the CVD-RFs needed to calculate the CVD risk by the systematic coronary risk evaluation (SCORE): 21.0. The CVD-RF recording rate was low in a rheumatology outpatient clinic. However  a systematic team-based model was superior compared to a RegROC. Further measures are warranted to improve CVD-RF recording in RA patients.
Psychiatry,,,Diagnoses and dropout among patients of danish psychiatrists in private practice. This study examined diagnoses of patients treated by psychiatrists in private practice in Denmark and identified predictors of dropout. Between 1996 and 2006  a total of 37 psychiatrists contributed data about treatment episodes to a quality assurance database. The diagnostic distribution was determined  and univariate and backward stepwise regression analysis was used to identify dropout predictors. Among 41 462 episodes (35 205 patients)  39%-41% were for an ICD-10 diagnosis of affective disorders  30%-35% for nervous and stress-related disorders  and 10% for personality disorders. For episodes involving these diagnoses  26 443 were terminated; 26.2% ended in dropout  which was predicted by the patient's being male  younger age (< or =44 years)  presence of personality disorder  shorter treatment duration (< or =111 days)  use of psychotropic medication  and a larger population per psychiatrist in the catchment area. Attention should be given to younger male patients treated for personality disorders  because they are at higher risk of treatment dropout.
General Practice,,,Group supervision in general practice as part of continuing professional development. The aim of the present study was to explore the current use of supervision groups and the value of such groups for today's Danish general practitioners (GPs). A questionnaire was sent to a representative sample comprising 10% of GPs registered with the Organisation of General Practitioners in Denmark. More than 60% of Danish GPs have participated in a supervision group  more females than males (p < 0.001)  at some time in their career. About a third is currently participating. The supervision activity is perceived as being formative and restorative. The main benefit from supervision was the training of communicative skills which allowed the GPs to better understand difficult patients while achieving an increase in their job satisfaction. A majority of Danish GPs have participated in a supervision group at some time. The activity is perceived as being formative and restorative. Participation is significantly more prevalent among female GPs than among male GPs. Future research is required to show how participation influences professional development; how participating in supervision groups contributes to prevention of burnout; and how the needs of males and females differ. This project was supported by the Committee of Multipractice Studies in General Practice and Foundation for Education and Development in General Practice (PLU). Not relevant.
Family Practice,,,[Diagnostic classification in Denmark with emphasis on general practice]. Diagnostic classification may be used as a structure for the naming of health problems and to create an overview in electronic patient records. Classification also facilitates access to health information and decision support  quality improvement and research. The International Classification Primary Care is now included in the WHO's Family of International Classifications and was introduced into Danish general practice in 1998. This system will be updated to ICPC-2-DK in 2009. In secondary health care  the ICD-10 is currently in use but a new system (SNOMED-CT) is underway.
General Practice,,,[General practitioners' storytelling is useful in quality development of general practice]. A consultant function to advice general practitioners (GPs) with regard to interactions with ethnic minority patients was developed in the Copenhagen municipality in 2002-2003 as a quality developing project. One part of the project focused on the challenges experienced by the GPs. Neither guidance nor teaching was required; instead the GPs were inclined to tell stories about their patients. This article describes and discusses how a narrative approach can be used in the circle of quality development. It is argued that a narrative analysis illuminates positions and structures and gives useful insight to act. In this project it illuminated structural challenges  which had to be solved at a level different from the individual level  which was the focus of the consultant project.
Family Practice,,,"Couldn't you have done just as well without the screening?". A qualitative study of benefits from screening as perceived by people without a high cardiovascular risk score. To explore how individuals whose health screening does not reveal a high cardiovascular risk score (CRS) interpret and respond to this result. Qualitative semi-structured interviews. Purposeful sampling reflected variations in age  gender  and self-rated health within the sample. Analysis and interpretation were informed by the Health Belief Model concerning individuals' cues to act when told there is a health threat  and by Hollnagel and Malterud's theories about personal self-assessed health resources. Participants were recruited among participants without a high cardiovascular risk score in a Danish health-screening project. Seven men and 15 women aged 36-50 years with a low or moderate cardiovascular risk score. The screening confirmed the participants' feeling of being in good health and they put emphasis on this acquired peace of mind. Participants used the results to eliminate worries and confirm their lifestyle up to now but were aware that the results gave no guarantee that there was nothing the matter elsewhere. Some paid a price for the reassurance since they had to undergo further examinations  had unfulfilled expectations  or were irritated at not being left in peace with their reassurance. Screened individuals who were shown not to have a high risk score appear to be reassured and confirmed in their own feeling of being healthy  and to be aware of the limitations of the screening. Consideration should be given to the possible risk of creating either insecurity or over-complacency through population screening.
Family Practice,,,[Patterns of contact with general practice in the daytime by guest workers with immigrant and refugee background in Copenhagen municipality  1998]. Little is known about immigrants' contact with the Danish health system. The aim of this study was to compare the pattern of contact with general practitioners of guest workers  refugees and non-immigrants in Copenhagen. 2.04 daytime contacts (home visits  clinic consultations and telephone consultations) by 423 202 inhabitants during the year 1998 as recorded in the National Patient Registry were merged with information about citizenship and place of birth in the Danish Central Office of Civil Registration. The contacts were described by the average number of contacts per person at risk per year. The differences between non-immigrants and immigrants were analyzed using Poisson regression. Immigrants and non-immigrants showed nearly the same sex- and age-dependent contact pattern. Immigrant children (1-18 years) and older people (60+ years) had a lower contact rate than non-immigrants in the same age groups. The 19- to 59-year-old guest worker women and men had 3% and 5% higher contact rates and the refugee women and men 2% and 17% higher contact rates  respectively  than non-immigrants in the same age group. The percentage of telephone consultations was lower for immigrants and the clinic consultation rate higher than for non-immigrants. There are sex- and age-specific differences between immigrants and non-immigrants. If equity is a goal in public health care  we should know more about its actual use. More complex research designs are needed  as well as theoretical studies  to shed light on these issues.
Family Practice,,,Long-term impact of elevated cardiovascular risk detected by screening. A qualitative interview study. To explore how persons with an elevated cardiovascular risk score (CRS) balanced health-related advice against the life they wanted to live or were able to live. 2000 Danes aged 30-50 were invited to participate in a health-screening project in general practice. Screenings were conducted at baseline and after one and five years  and included among other screening procedures a calculation of CRS (see Figure 1). Participants with an elevated CRS were asked to participate in a qualitative semi-structured interview. They were selected by stratified purposeful sampling reflecting variations in age  sex. and perceived health. Nine men and five women aged 33-50 years. THEORETICAL FRAMES OF REFERENCE: Bandura's theory of self-efficacy and the Health Belief Model's consideration of individuals' cues to act against a health threat supported analysis. Being informed about an elevated CRS had a considerable impact on the informants. They initiated significant lifestyle changes  though only to a limited degree when such changes would affect their quality of life adversely. In cases where other results of the multiphasic screening were normal  interpreted as such  or if there were stressful circumstances in the informant's life  the elevated CRS receded into the background. Doctors  who inform individuals about the impact of risk factors  need to know that the consequences and health advice are not always interpreted by laypeople as supposed by the medical culture.
Family Practice,,,You can't prevent everything anyway: a qualitative study of beliefs and attitudes about refusing health screening in general practice. The aim of this study was to explore beliefs and attitudes about refusing health screening in general practice. In 1991  in Ebeltoft  Denmark people aged between 30 and 50 years were invited to participate in a 5-year randomized  controlled  population-based project testing the value of health screenings and health discussions in general practice. In 1994  non-participants who declined the offered health screening but expressed willingness to be contacted in the future were asked to participate in a qualitative interview. They were drawn by stratified purposeful sampling which reflected variation in perceived health  body mass index  age and sex. The sample comprised six men and 12 women Some had not participated because they were busy  felt healthy or had recently been examined. The non-participants emphasized the limitations of health screening and did not want possible risk factors to be revealed  or their feeling of good health to be disturbed. They stressed the individual's own responsibility for maintaining good health and believed that a positive attitude promoted health. They would contact their GP if they had symptoms. Non-participants have rational views on risk factor testing and on their own responsibility for maintaining health. Non-attendance was due to a conscious choice which included consulting their own GP.
Family Practice,,,Transcultural general practice in Scandinavia. During the past 20 years  many immigrants from all over the world have settled in Scandinavia. Primary care physicians today are therefore meeting patients from a variety of socio-cultural  religious  and ethnic backgrounds. In addition to endemic diseases  the new immigrants are exposed to Western illness and disease patterns and psychic reactions to life events  and the on-going adaptive process may add to the dilemmas of segregation in housing and work. During consultations  doctors and patients frame this ill health by culturally determined ideas of health  illness  and treatment. This paper deals with Scandinavian studies concerning transcultural issues in primary care by exploring the Scandinavian literature. Relatively few studies were found in the databases. Many of them were small  making it difficult to generalise the findings. Descriptive explorative studies suggest problems in communication  behaviour  mental ill health  physiotherapy  and organisation of care. No studies were found concerning issues such as genital mutilation  environmental diseases  family conflicts  or chronic disorders other than pain. From action research studies or randomised-controlled trials  it can be cautiously concluded that psychiatric care may be little accepted in many immigrant groups and that immigrants with non-specific pain are best handled in primary care where dialogue about pain is to be preferred to traditional treatment. Brief advice regarding communication and organisation of care is also given. In our opinion  studies using action research methods are to be preferred  since clinical transcultural care deals with complex illness patterns  including many emotional dilemmas.
Family Practice,,,[Disagreement between physicians' medication records and information given by patients]. A survey was conducted to evaluate the level of disagreement between the drug records of family doctors and information provided by patients at the time of hospitalisation. One hundred patients acutely admitted to a hospital department of medicine were consecutively included if the patient ingested more than two non-OTC drugs. A second drug interview was performed shortly after admission  and the patient's current medication was recorded. If no written medical record from the referring family doctor was available at the time of admission  the doctor was contacted by phone for supplementary information. Discrepancies between the information given by the patient and the medical records of family doctors were recorded. The results were analysed blindly by two of the authors (one senior and one junior doctor) to determine if the discrepancies were clinically relevant for the patient. We found at least one clinically relevant and potentially dangerous discrepancy in the medical records of 40% (95% CI 30%-50%) of the patients. In all  discrepancies were found in the drug lists of 63% of the patients. The patients with discrepancies were similar in age  sex  way of hospitalization and number of drugs ingested  compared to those without discrepancies. Afterwards the family doctors were invited to a meeting in which these problems were evaluated. We conclude that there is an urgent need for improvement in the communication between the primary and secondary health care sectors concerning medication being prescribed for patients with chronic diseases. The large number of discrepancies in the drug records of patients in this study is discouraging.
Global Health,,,[Potentially beneficial effects of climate changes]. Climate changes have many unbeneficial effects on human health  but may also have beneficial effects. An increased mean temperature reduces the incidence of death due to hypothermia and cardiovascular disease and may increase exercise frequency. As the ozone layer decreases  the synthesis of vitamin D in the organism will also increase. An increased level of plasma vitamin D has beneficial effects on bone- and muscle health  seems to reduce cancer incidence and mortality and reduces the prevalence of autoimmune- and cardiovascular disease.
General Surgery,,,No Correlation Between Work-Hours and Operative Volumes--A Comparison Between United States and Danish Operative Volumes Achieved During Surgical Residency. Since 2003  United States residents have been limited to an 80-hour workweek. This has prompted concerns of reduced educational quality  especially inadequate operating exposure. In contrast  the Danish surgical specialty-training program mandates a cap on working hours of 37 per week. We hypothesize that there is no direct correlation between work-hours and operative volume achieved during surgical residency. To test the hypothesis  we compare Danish and US operative volumes achieved during surgical residency training. Retrospective comparative study. The data from the US population was extracted from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education database for General Surgery residents from 2012 to 2013. For Danish residents  a questionnaire with case categories matching the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education categories were sent to all Danish surgeons graduating the national surgical residency program in 2012 or 2013  54 in total. In all  30 graduated residents (55%) responded to the Danish survey. We found no significant differences in mean total major procedures (1002.4 vs 976.9  p = 0.28) performed during residency training  but comparing average major procedures per year  the US residents achieve significantly more (132.3 vs 195.4  p <0.01). When factoring in differences in time spent in training  this amounts to a weekly average difference of 1.2 cases throughout training. In this study  we find no difference in overall surgical volumes between Danes and US residents during their surgical training. When time in training was accounted for  differences between weekly surgical volumes achieved were minor  indicating a lack of direct correlation between weekly work-hours and operative volumes achievable. Factors other than work-hours seem to effect on operative volumes achieved during training.
General Surgery,,,Comprehensive feedback on trainee surgeons' non-technical skills. This study aimed to explore the content of conversations  feedback style  and perceived usefulness of feedback to trainee surgeons when conversations were stimulated by a tool for assessing surgeons' non-technical skills. Trainee surgeons and their supervisors used the Non-Technical Skills for Surgeons in Denmark tool to stimulate feedback conversations. Audio recordings of post-operation feedback conversations were collected. Trainees and supervisors provided questionnaire responses on the usefulness and comprehensiveness of the feedback. The feedback conversations were qualitatively analyzed for content and feedback style. Usefulness was investigated using a scale from 1 to 5 and written comments were qualitatively analyzed. Six trainees and six supervisors participated in eight feedback conversations. Eighty questionnaires (response rate 83 percent) were collected from 13 trainees and 12 supervisors. Conversations lasted median eight (2-15) minutes. Supervisors used the elements and categories in the tool to structure the content of the conversations. Supervisors tended to talk about the trainees' actions and their own frames rather than attempting to understand the trainees' perceptions. Supervisors and trainees welcomed the feedback opportunity and agreed that the conversations were useful and comprehensive. The content of the feedback conversations reflected the contents of the tool and the feedback was considered useful and comprehensive. However  supervisors talked primarily about their own frames  so in order for the feedback to reach its full potential  supervisors may benefit from training techniques to stimulate a deeper reflection among trainees.
General Surgery,,,Assessing trainee surgeons' nontechnical skills: five cases are sufficient for reliable assessments. Trainee surgeons would benefit from regular  formative assessments to ensure they learn the nontechnical aspects of surgical performance. Non-Technical Skills for Surgeons in Denmark (NOTSSdk) is a tool to assess surgeons' nontechnical skills (NTS) during an operation. The aims of this study were to explore which parts of NOTSSdk supervisors use to assess trainee surgeons' NTS  to determine the internal consistency reliability of NOTSSdk  and to estimate how many operations were needed to obtain reliable ratings of a trainee surgeon's NTS. A total of 12 supervisors from 2 hospitals assessed 13 trainees in 48 procedures including laparoscopic cholecystectomies  inguinal hernia repairs  and laparoscopic appendectomies. NOTSSdk showed good internal consistency reliability (R(2) = 0.95). Supervisors used both categories and elements of the tool to provide assessments  although 2 elements of leadership ("supporting others" and "coping with pressure") were considered irrelevant in 27% to 31% of the cases. Assessments of 5 procedures were sufficient to gain reliable ratings (Generalizability coefficient > 0.80) of a trainee surgeon's NTS. As supervisors used the full tool  the internal consistency reliability was high and assessment of 5 procedures could be achieved in clinical practice  we suggest that NOTSSdk could be implemented as a formative assessment tool to facilitate the training of surgeons' NTS.
General Surgery,,,Reliable assessment of general surgeons' non-technical skills based on video-recordings of patient simulated scenarios. Nontechnical skills are essential for safe and efficient surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of an assessment tool for surgeons' nontechnical skills  Non-Technical Skills for Surgeons dk (NOTSSdk)  and the effect of rater training. A 1-day course was conducted for 15 general surgeons in which they rated surgeons' nontechnical skills in 9 video recordings of scenarios simulating real intraoperative situations. Data were gathered from 2 sessions separated by a 4-hour training session. Interrater reliability was high for both pretraining ratings (Cronbach's α = .97) and posttraining ratings (Cronbach's α = .98). There was no statistically significant development in assessment skills. The D study showed that 2 untrained raters or 1 trained rater was needed to obtain generalizability coefficients >.80. The high pretraining interrater reliability indicates that videos were easy to rate and Non-Technical Skills for Surgeons dk easy to use. This implies that Non-Technical Skills for Surgeons dk (NOTSSdk) could be an important tool in surgical training  potentially improving safety and quality for surgical patients.
Chiropractic,,,Motion palpation of the lumbar spine--a problem with the test or the tester? The purpose of this study is to investigate if it is possible to recognize whether a specific lumbar motion segment was manipulated or not by using motion palpation (MP) as a diagnostic tool in ordinary clinic patients and by using teams of practitioners with various levels of experience. Two teams were created: team A had an experienced doctor of chiropractic who palpated the patients and an inexperienced doctor who performed the treatment  whereas team B had the opposite composition. One chiropractor in each of the 2 teams identified a fixation with the help of MP and specified the treatment of his or her choice for this fixation. A few minutes later  the second chiropractor then randomly either manipulated or did not manipulate the indicated segment  according to the first chiropractor's instruction. Blinded  the first chiropractor repalpated the segment and determined whether or not treatment was provided. Results were compared with (1) chance findings  (2) the clinicians' own pre hoc and specific expectations in relation to the treated cases  and (3) our expectation in relation to the untreated cases. Team A failed to reach their own standards in relation to treated segments  not even being better than chance  and was also unable to detect the untreated cases. The palpating chiropractor in team B was able to identify the manipulated segments in 87% of 15 cases (P < .05) and in 80% of 11 nonmanipulated cases (not significant). The successful palpator  therefore  reached the team's general standard of 85% success rate but not the specific standard of a 100% success rate. None reached our standard of identifying 100% of all untreated segments. It is possible for some practitioners to identify treated segments using MP. Gold standard palpators should therefore be used to calibrate other persons' ability to perform MP  both in the clinical setting and in future research studies.
Nursing,,,Developing and evaluating rare disease educational materials co-created by expert clinicians and patients: the paradigm of congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Patients with rare diseases face health disparities and are often challenged to find accurate information about their condition. We aimed to use the best available evidence and community partnerships to produce patient education materials for congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH) and the olfacto-genital (Kallmann) syndrome (i.e.  CHH and defective sense of smell)  and to evaluate end-user acceptability. Expert clinicians  researchers and patients co-created the materials in a multi-step process. Six validated algorithms were used to assess reading level of the final product. Comprehensibility and actionability were measured using the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool via web-based data collection. Descriptive statistics were employed to summarize data and thematic analysis for analyzing open-ended responses. Subsequently  translation and cultural adaption were conducted by clinicians and patients who are native speakers. Co-created patient education materials reached the target 6(th) grade reading level according to 2/6 (33%) algorithms (range: grade 5.9-9.7). The online survey received 164 hits in 2 months and 63/159 (40%) of eligible patients completed the evaluation. Patients ranged in age from 18 to 66 years (median 36  mean 39 ± 11) and 52/63 (83%)  had adequate health literacy. Patients scored understandability at 94.2% and actionability at 90.5%. The patient education materials were culturally adapted and translated into 20 languages (available in Additional file 1). Partnering with patients enabled us to create patient education materials that met patient- identified needs as evidenced by high end-user acceptability  understandability and actionability. The web-based evaluation was effective for reaching dispersed rare disease patients. Combining dissemination via traditional healthcare professional platforms as well as patient-centric sites can facilitate broad uptake of culturally adapted translations. This process may serve as a roadmap for creating patient education materials for other rare diseases.
Pharmacoepidemiology,,,Phenobarbital compared to benzodiazepines in alcohol withdrawal treatment: A register-based cohort study of subsequent benzodiazepine use  alcohol recidivism and mortality. Long-acting benzodiazepines such as chlordiazepoxide are recommended as first-line treatment for alcohol withdrawal. These drugs are known for their abuse liability and might increase alcohol consumption among problem drinkers. Phenobarbital could be an alternative treatment option  possibly with the drawback of a more pronounced acute toxicity. We evaluated if phenobarbital compared to chlordiazepoxide decreased the risk of subsequent use of benzodiazepines  alcohol recidivism and mortality. The study was a register-based cohort study of patients admitted for alcohol withdrawal 1998-2013 and treated with either phenobarbital or chlordiazepoxide. Patients were followed for one year. We calculated hazard ratios (HR) for benzodiazepine use  alcohol recidivism and mortality associated with alcohol withdrawal treatment  while adjusting for confounders. A total of 1063 patients treated with chlordiazepoxide and 1365 patients treated with phenobarbital were included. After one year  the outcome rates per 100 person-years in the phenobarbital versus the chlordiazepoxide cohort were 9.20 vs. 5.13 for use of benzodiazepine  37.9 vs. 37.9 for alcohol recidivism and 29 vs. 59 for mortality. Comparing phenobarbital to chlordiazepoxide treated  the HR of subsequent use of benzodiazepines was 1.56 (95%CI 1.05-2.30). Similarly  the HR for alcohol recidivism was 0.99 (95%CI 0.84-1.16). Lastly  the HR for 30-days and 1 year mortality was 0.25 (95%CI 0.08-0.78) and 0.51 (95%CI 0.31-0.86). There was no decreased risk of subsequent benzodiazepine use or alcohol recidivism in patients treated with phenobarbital compared to chlordiazepoxide. Phenobarbital treatment was associated with decreased mortality  which might be confounded by somatic comorbidity among patients receiving chlordiazepoxide.
Global Health,,,Psychiatric disease as a risk factor in fast-track hip and knee replacement. Recent studies suggest that patients with psychiatric disorders tend to do worse than patients without a psychiatric diagnosis when undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Whether this is due to their psychiatric condition  pharmacological treatment  a combination of the two  or something else has not been thoroughly analyzed-and there are no internationally accepted guidelines for perioperative management of psychiatric patients. This overview summarizes our current knowledge on perioperative risks in patients with preoperative psychiatric disorders and the possible role of psychotropic drugs in the perioperative course. This will be useful when planning future strategies for improvement of surgical outcome following hip and knee arthroplasty.
Stroke Rehabilitation,,,Intensive treadmill training in the acute phase after ischemic stroke. The aim of the study was to (a) assess the feasibility of intensive treadmill training in patients with acute ischemic stroke  (b) test whether physical activity of the legs during training increases with time  and (c) evaluate to what extent training sessions contribute toward the overall physical activity of these patients. Twenty hospitalized patients with acute ischemic stroke trained on a treadmill twice daily for 30 min for 5 days and on day 30. Physical activity was measured as activity counts (AC) from accelerometers. A total of 196 of 224 initiated training sessions were completed. Training started 41.5±14 h after symptom onset. Only nonserious adverse events occurred in 14.7% of the sessions. An intensity of at least 50% of the individual heart rate reserve was obtained in 31% of training sessions. There was a significant increase in AC/min in the legs during training sessions with increasing number of days  with the median AC being 133% higher on day 5 than on day 1. AC in the paretic leg during 60 min of training constituted median 53% of the daytime AC. Early intensive treadmill training in acute ischemic stroke patients is thus feasible and contributes considerably toward the patients' overall physical activity.
Stroke Rehabilitation,,,Quantitative measurement of physical activity in acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack. The purpose of this study was to quantitatively measure and describe the amount and pattern of physical activity in patients within the first week after acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack using accelerometers. A total of 100 patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack admitted to our acute stroke unit wore Actical accelerometers attached to both wrists and ankles and the hip for ≤7 days. Patients were included within 72 hours of symptom onset. Accelerometer output was measured in activity counts (AC). Patients were tested daily with Scandinavian Stroke Scale. Physical activity peaked in the morning and declined during the rest of the day. In patients with stroke  total AC were 71% lower than in patients with transient ischemic attack. AC were 80% lower in the paretic compared with those in the nonparetic arm in patients with ischemic stroke. For the legs AC were 44% lower on the paretic side and an overall increase in AC with time was found. There was a significant increase in AC with increasing Scandinavian Stroke Scale and a decrease in AC with increasing age. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using accelerometers to quantitatively and continuously measure physical activity simultaneously from all 4 extremities and the hip in patients with acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack. Our study provides quantitative evidence of physical inactivity in patients with acute ischemic stroke. The method offers a low cost and noninvasive tool for future clinical interventional physiotherapeutic and early mobilization studies. http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT01560520.
General Practice,,,Use of primary health care prior to a postpartum psychiatric episode. Childbirth is a strong trigger of psychiatric episodes. Nevertheless  use of primary care before these episodes is not quantified. The aim was to study the use of general practice in Denmark from two years before to one year after childbirth in women who developed postpartum psychiatric disorders. A matched cohort study was conducted including women who gave birth in the period 1996-2010. Women were divided into four groups: (i) all mothers with postpartum psychiatric episodes 0-3 months after birth  n = 939; 2: All mothers with a postpartum psychiatric episode 3-12 months after birth  n = 1 436; and (iii) two comparison groups of mothers  total n = 6 630 among 320 620 eligible women. Denmark. Women born in Denmark after 1 January 1960  restricting the cohort to women who gave birth to their first singleton child between 1 January 1996 and 20 October 2010. The main outcome measures were consultation rates  consultation rate ratios  and rate differences. Women who developed a psychiatric episode after childbirth had higher GP consultation rates before  during  and after the pregnancy. Women with a psychiatric episode 0-3 months postpartum had 6.89 (95% CI 6.60; 7.18) mean number of consultations during pregnancy  corresponding to 1.52 (95% CI 1.22; 1.82) more visits than the comparison group. Women with a postpartum psychiatric episode had higher use of GP-based primary health care services years before the childbirth  and in this specific group of patients childbirth itself triggered a marked increase in the number of GP contacts postpartum.

Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Preoperative assessment of surgical patients with hypertension arterialis]. Almost one out of four patients referred for non cardiac surgery presents preoperatively with hypertensio arterialis (HA). The risk of perioperative cardiovascular complication increases with the grade of HA and the coexistence of end organ damage. This paper is a review of the current knowledge of HA and anaesthesia. It is recommended that patients with grade I and II HA proceed for surgery. But the evidence for patients with grade III HA is less clear. Patients without end organ damage can proceed for surgery  while patients with end organ damage should be stabilized before surgery.
Anesthesiology,,,[Targeted training in peripheral nerve blockade]. Peripheral nerve blockade (PNB) is an important part of the anaesthesiologist's armamentarium. It constitutes an alternative to general anaesthesia  thus it is important that all anaesthesiologists have adequate skills in this area. Lack of sufficient experience during training makes many graduates uncomfortable about performing PNB. An answer to this problem is to provide adequate education in PNB in the early stage of postgraduate training. This article presents how we  at our institution  have set up a PNB program that provides value.
Medical Oncology,,,Does adding an appended oncology module to the Global Trigger Tool increase its value? To determine any additional value in the evaluation of safety levels by adding an appended oncology module to the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's Global Trigger Tool (GTT). Comparison of two independent retrospective chart reviews: one review team using the general GTT method and one using the general GTT method plus the appended oncology module on the same inpatient charts. The Department of Clinical Oncology at a Danish University Hospital (1000 beds). All inpatients admitted to the hospital in 2010  n = 3692  biweekly sample of 10 admission charts resulting in a double review of 240 charts. Total number of identified adverse events (AEs)  distribution of identified AEs in the harm categories of the National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention (NCC MERP)  AEs per 100 admissions and AEs per 1000 admission days. No significant (95% confidence interval) difference was found between review teams using the general GTT versus the general GTT plus the appended oncology module on the total number of identified AEs  AEs per 100 admissions  AEs per 1000 admission days or in the overall distribution of identified AEs in the five NCC MERP harm categories. The study showed that adding the appended oncology module to the GTT did not increase its value regarding the evaluation of safety levels. This finding could be due to the measurement error of the GTT. Further studies evaluating the measurement properties and the specific additional modules to the general GTT are needed.
Hospital Administration,,,[Patient-centered care in Danish hospitals will heighten the quality]. Patient-centered care is a multidimensional quality goal  which aims at establishing a partnership between doctors and patients and to ensure that clinical practices are based on the individual patient's needs and preferences. In this article the concept of patient-centered care and how to apply this in a hospital setting is sought clarified. The principles of patient-centered care and the organizational preconditions needed for the implementation of this are described based on the literature  followed by a discussion of the status and challenges in Danish health care. We conclude that a stronger focus on patient-centered care is needed.
Global Health,,,Resting heart rate and risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in asymptomatic aortic stenosis: the SEAS study. An elevated resting heart rate (RHR) may be an early sign of cardiac failure  but its prognostic value during watchful waiting in asymptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) is largely unknown. RHR was determined by annual ECGs in the Simvastatin and Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis (SEAS) study of asymptomatic mild-to-moderate AS patients. Primary endpoint in this substudy was major cardiovascular events (MCEs) and secondary outcomes its individual components. Multivariable Cox-models using serially-measured RHR were used to examine the prognostic impact of RHR per se. 1563 patients were followed for a mean of 4.3years (6751 patient-years of follow-up)  553 (35%) MCEs occurred  10% (n=151) died  including 75 cardiovascular deaths. In multivariable analysis  baseline RHR was independently associated with MCEs (HR 1.1 per 10min(-1) faster  95% CI: 1.0-1.3) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 1.3 per 10min(-1) faster  95% CI: 1.0-1.7  both p≤0.03). Updating RHR with annual in-study reexaminations  time-varying RHR was highly associated with excess MCEs (HR 1.1 per 10min(-1) faster  95% CI: 1.1-1.3) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 1.4 per 10min(-1) faster  95% CI: 1.2-1.7  both p≤0.006). The association of RHR with MCEs and cardiovascular mortality was not dependent on atrial fibrillation status (both p≥0.06 for interaction). RHR is independently associated with MCEs and cardiovascular death in asymptomatic AS (Clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier NCT00092677).
Obstetrics,,,Vacuum extraction: development and test of a procedure-specific rating scale. To develop and validate an Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) scale for vacuum extraction. Two-part study design: Primarily  development of a procedure-specific checklist for vacuum extraction. Hereafter  validation of the developed OSATS scale for vacuum extraction in a prospective observational study. Rigshospitalet  University Hospital of Copenhagen. For development  an obstetric expert from each labor ward in Denmark (28 departments) was invited to participate. For validation  nine first-year residents and 10 chief physicians with daily work in the obstetric field were tested. The Delphi method was used for development of the scale. In a simulated vacuum extraction scenario  first-year residents and obstetric chief physicians were rated using the developed OSATS scale for vacuum extraction to test construct validity of the scale. Consensus for the content of the scale. To test the scale of Cronbach's alpha  interclass correlation and differential item function was calculated in the prospective study. 89% completed the first and 61% completed the second Delphi round. Hereafter  consensus was obtained. There was a significant difference between residents' and experts' performance for total score and for the score of the separate parts of the scale. Cronbach's alpha for total score and for the separate parts of the scale was 0.91-0.95 and interclass correlation 0.84-0.9. The OSATS scale for vacuum extraction is a reliable test for differentiating between competence levels in a simulated setting.
Internal Medicine,,,[Group supervision of junior doctors]. The purpose of this pilot study was to examine how group supervision may help junior doctors recognize the learning potential in difficult on-the-job situations. Eight junior doctors from an internal medicine department participated in a group supervision project during three months in the spring of 2007. Two supervisors from the hospital's Human Resource Department facilitated the process. The main themes and cases were related to the profession and not to private problems or aspects of biomedical knowledge. At the end of the project  all participants filled out an evaluation questionnaire consisting of qualitative as well as quantitative questions. After the group supervision sessions  the doctors felt better equipped to meet the challenges of everyday work and had discovered the value of using each other as colleagues. Furthermore  they stated that the method had helped them improve their professional and managerial competencies as well as their ability to cooperate. Seven of the eight participants would participate in group-supervision again if possible. Participants' absence was mostly due to overtime work  being on call or being out of town. The results indicate that group supervision can be beneficial for junior doctors as it illustrates to them the learning potential of the difficult professional situations that inevitably occur on the job. When working with personal reflection in a supervision group  junior doctors realise how many doubts and thoughts they have in common  and how they can benefit from each other in addressing these issues. Success is dependent on high motivation and good planning.
Hematology,,,Extracorporeal photopheresis in refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease: the influence on peripheral blood T cell subpopulations. A study by the Hellenic Association of Hematology. Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) has been established as an effective treatment modality for patients with chronic extensive graft-versus host disease (GVHD). In the present study  we evaluated the influence of ECP on the numbers of CD4+  CD8+  CD20+  CD56+ cells  and on T-regulatory (Tregs)  as well as on the numbers of naïve  central memory (CM)  and effector memory (EM) T-cells in patients treated for refractory chronic GVHD. Flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes was performed for the calculation of the different T-cell subsets. Patients with GVHD had a higher percentage of EM-CD4+ cells in comparison with healthy donors (p=0.046). The percentages of naïve-CD8+  naïve-CD4+  CM-CD8+  CM-CD4+  EM-CD8+  and Tregs were not different between patients with GVHD and healthy donors. Similarly there was no statistical difference in the percentages of naïve  CM  and EM CD4+ and CD8+ cells before and after 3 months of treatment with ECP. However  in the subset of Tregs a statistically significant increase was observed after 3 months of treatment with ECP (p=0.015). Responders to ECP had statistically significantly higher absolute numbers of CD4+  and CD8+ cells  in comparison with non-responders. These data further support the concept that ECP does not cause immune-suppression  but should be better considered as an immune-modulating treatment.
Hematology,,,Extracorporeal photopheresis in the treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease. The Hellenic experience: a study by the Hellenic association of hematology. The Hellenic experience regarding the efficacy of extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) in the treatment of 58 patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is presented in this article. All 58  except one patient  had failed at least one line of immunosuppressive treatment including steroids. Thirty-three out of 58 patients showed an objective overall response to ECP in a median time of 10 weeks after the onset of treatment. The cumulative incidence of overall response was 65.1%. In multivariate analysis  the presence of severe chronic GVHD was the only parameter associated with a significantly lower probability of response to treatment (RR=0.4  CI 95% 0.2-0.9  p=0.03). Responders to treatment with ECP were more likely to discontinue immunosuppression  had a lower probability of non-relapse mortality (RR=0.2  CI 95% 0.1-0.5  p=0.002)  and a higher probability of overall survival (RR=7.8  CI 95% 3-20  p<0.001) in comparison with non-responders. Eight out of 58 patients experienced relapse of the original disease. The cumulative incidence of relapse in the group of responders to ECP was 6%  while it was 25% in the group of non-responders to ECP. In multivariate analysis  response to treatment with ECP was the only parameter statistically associated with a significantly decreased hazard of relapse (RR=0.1  CI 95% 0.1-0.7  p=0.02). ECP should be tested as first-line treatment in patients with cGVHD with the aim to minimize the duration of immunosuppression and the rate of relapse of the malignant disease.
Gynecology,Obstetrics,,Development of obstetrical and gynecological journals  2007 to 2013: a trend analysis. To analyze the trends and developments among journals in the specialty of obstetrics and gynecology. Using the Journal Citation Reports from 2007 to 2013  we analyzed the impact factor (IF)  Eigenfactor® Score (ES)  and Article Influence® Score (AIS) of 43 journals in the field of obstetrics and gynecology published in this time period. From 78 journals of the Journal Citation Report 2013  43 were selected for this study. The mean IF grew from 1.68 ± 0.97 in 2007 to 2.12 ± 1.05 in 2013  the ES from 0.0113 ± 0.0169 to 0.0114 ± 0.0140  and the AIS from 0.513 ± 0.302 to 0.663 ± 0.359. Differences in the IF  ES  and AIS between journals from the United States versus Europe could be observed. In most cases  the IF  ES  and AIS increased between 2007 and 2013. Strong correlations could be found between IF  AIS  and ES. The overall mean IF for obstetrical and gynecological journals increased over the analyzed time period. The IF remains the standard measure to compare scientific journals. It correlates well with two major alternative measures of scientific impact  the ES and especially the AIS. Other measures are evolving and might show superior usage in the future.
Telemedicine,,,Health care in the circumpolar world: Greenland. Greenland is part of the Kingdom of Denmark and it is the world's largest island. An ice cap covers 85% of its territory. The population is about 57 000 inhabitants  with 14 000 living in the capital Nuuk  and 10 000 in villages and other small settlements. There are pronounced regional variations in lifestyle and living conditions. The Greenland Home Rule Government assumed responsibility  for health care on 1 January 1992. Greenland's territory is divided into 16 health care districts. Queen Ingrid's Hospital in Nuuk is the national hospital and has 156 beds and numerous specialist physicians associated with it. Each health district has a health care centre with one or more physicians  nurses and other health care personnel appropriate for the number of people living in the district. Each district health centre is responsible for primary health care in towns  villages and other small settlements  and the health centres treat all common illnesses. The health centres handle uncomplicated births  minor surgery  common treatment in internal medicine and community mental health services. The centres have a number of inpatient beds proportional to the number of people in the health district. People with more complicated illnesses are referred to Queen Ingrid's Hospital in Nuuk or to specialised treatment in Denmark.
Specialization,,,Are some of the challenging aspects of the CanMEDS roles valid outside Canada? Many countries have adopted the CanMEDS roles. However  there is limited information on how these apply in an international context and in different specialties. To survey trainee and specialist ratings of the importance of the CanMEDS roles and perceived ability to perform tasks within the roles. We surveyed 8749 doctors within a defined region (eastern Denmark) via a single-issue  mailed questionnaire. Each of the 7 roles was represented by 3 questionnaire items to be rated for perceived importance and confidence in ability to perform the role. Responses were received from 3476 doctors (42.8%)  including 190 interns  201 doctors in the introductory year of specialist training  529 residents and 2152 specialists. The overall mean rating of importance (on a scale of 1-5) of the aspects of competence described in the CanMEDS roles was 4.2 (standard deviation 0.6) and did not differ between trainee groups and specialists. Mean ratings of confidence were lower than ratings of importance and increased across the groups from interns to specialists. Differences between specialty groups were evident in both importance and confidence for many of the roles. For laboratory  technical and  to a lesser extent  cognitive specialties  the role of Health Advocate scored the lowest in importance. For general medicine specialties  the roles of Medical Expert  Collaborator  Manager and Scholar all scored lower for importance and confidence. This study provides a sketch of the content and construct validity of the CanMEDS roles in a non-Canadian setting. More research is needed in how these aspects of competence can be best taught and applied across specialties in different jurisdictions.
Epidemiology,,,Validity of the International Classification of Diseases  10th revision discharge diagnosis codes for hyponatraemia in the Danish National Registry of Patients. To examine the validity of the International Classification of Diseases  10th revision (ICD-10) codes for hyponatraemia in the nationwide population-based Danish National Registry of Patients (DNRP) among inpatients of all ages. Population-based validation study. All somatic hospitals in the North and Central Denmark Regions from 2006 through 2011. Patients of all ages admitted to hospital (n=819 701 individual patients) during the study period. The patient could be included in the study more than once  and our study did not restrict to patients with serum sodium measurements (total of n=2 186 642 hospitalisations). We validated ICD-10 discharge diagnoses of hyponatraemia recorded in the DNRP  using serum sodium measurements obtained from the laboratory information systems (LABKA) research database as the gold standard. One sodium value <135 mmol/L measured at any time during hospitalisation confirmed the diagnosis. We estimated sensitivity  specificity  positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for ICD-10 codes for hyponatraemia overall and for cut-off points for increasing hyponatraemia severity. An ICD-10 code for hyponatraemia was recorded in the DNRP in 5850 of the 2 186 642 hospitalisations identified. According to laboratory measurements  however  hyponatraemia was present in 306 418 (14%) hospitalisations. Sensitivity of hyponatraemia diagnoses was 1.8% (95% CI 1.7% to 1.8%). For sodium values <115 mmol/L  sensitivity was 34.3% (95% CI 32.6% to 35.9%). The overall PPV was 92.5% (95% CI 91.8% to 93.1%) and decreased with increasing hyponatraemia severity. Specificity and NPV were high for all cut-off points (≥99.8% and ≥86.2%  respectively). Patients with hyponatraemia without a corresponding ICD-10 discharge diagnosis were younger and had higher Charlson Comorbidity Index scores than patients with hyponatraemia with a hyponatraemia code in the DNRP. ICD-10 codes for hyponatraemia in the DNRP have high specificity but very low sensitivity. Laboratory test results  not discharge diagnoses  should be used to ascertain hyponatraemia.
General Practice,,,Prevalence of overweight and obesity in Danish preschool children over a 10-year period: a study of two birth cohorts in general practice. To determine change in the prevalence of overweight and obesity in preschool children  over a 10-year period and to identify possible predictors of overweight in 5-year-old children. Anthropometric data from birth and routine child health examinations at 3 and 5 years of age performed in general practice were collected in 5580 children from two Funen birth cohorts (1992 and 2001  respectively) representing 48% of the total population at similar age. The prevalence of overweight and obesity was classified using the International Obesity Task Force definitions. In a Danish representative survey of preschool children  the average body mass index (BMI) and prevalence of overweight and obesity did not vary significantly during the 10-year period. No significant changes in mean birth weight were registered and mean BMI in the group of obese children did not increase. Overweight or obesity at 5 years was strongly associated with overweight and obesity at 3 years and with birth weight and gender. The prevalence of overweight and obesity was observed to be stable over a decade in Danish preschool children without changes in mean BMI in the group of obese children. A strong association between overweight and obesity at 3 and at 5 years of age was detected.
Rehabilitation,,,Old women with a recent fall history show improved muscle strength and function sustained for six months after finishing training. Restricted physical activity as a consequence of chronic disease or injury is a predictor of functional decline. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that a 6- month multidimensional training program would have sustained beneficial effects upon the physiological  functional and psychological condition of old women with a recent history of falls. Participants were 65 home-dwelling women (70-90 years) identified from hospital records as having had an accidental fall. After assessment of muscle strength  balance performance  walking speed  balance confidence  and physical activity level  the participants were randomly assigned to a control group (n=33) or a training group (n=32)  who performed a multidimensional training program including moderate resistance exercise and balance exercise twice weekly for 6 months. Measurements were repeated after 6 and 12 months. Six months of multidimensional training resulted in significant improvements and between-group differences in isometric knee extension strength (p<0.05)  trunk extension/ flexion strength (p<0.001)  habitual/maximal walking speed (p<0.001) and balance performance (p<0.001). At follow-up  6 months after intervention  these improvements were preserved in the training group and there was also a significant between- group difference with regard to balance confidence. No between-group differences were found concerning number of falls or physical activity level during the one-year study period. A multi-dimensional training program produced significant improvements in physiological and functional risk factors for falls and disability in women aged 70-90 years with a recent history of falls.
Medical Oncology,Occupational Therapy,,Dysphagia training after head and neck cancer fails to follow legislation and national recommendations. Dysphagia is a known sequela after head and neck cancer (HNC) and causes malnutrition  aspiration pneumonia and a reduced quality of life. Due to improved survival rates  the number of patients with sequelae is increasing. Evidence on the ideal HNC-specific rehabilitation of dysphagia is lacking  but several studies indicate that early initiation is crucial. The aim of this study was to map the existing dysphagia rehabilitation programmes for HNC patients in Denmark. Occupational therapists (OTs)  oncologists and surgeons from five hospitals participated in a nationwide questionnaire-based survey  along with OTs from 39 municipal health centres. HNC patients rarely receive preventive occupational therapy before treatment  and hospital-based OTs mainly attend to HNC patients undergoing surgery. Far from all oncology and surgical departments complete the required rehabilitation plans upon discharge which leaves many patients untreated. There are vast differences between the municipalities' rehabilitation programmes and between the expertise employed in municipalities and hospitals. Existing HNC rehabilitation does not meet official Danish guidelines. Only a fraction of HNC patients are offered rehabilitation and often long after completing treatment. Municipal rehabilitation services vary considerably in terms of type  duration  intensity and expertise. Dysphagia-related rehabilitation requires an improved monitoration  possibly with an increase in the uptake of centralised dysphagia rehabilitation. not relevant. not relevant.
Family Practice,Medical Oncology,,In a unique position or squeezed out? The professional roles of general practitioners in cancer care in general and of young adult cancer patients in particular. Exploring experiences of general practitioners (GPs)  regarding roles in cancer care of young adults (YAs). Ten qualitative interviews with GPs were theoretically analyzed against professional characteristics. The GPs tended to make general statements  using everyday language  they experience that their patients disappear  they are seldom involved  and they lack knowledge. GPs have few experiences with YA cancer patients  but they have a potentially unique role in general primary cancer care if they develop their vocational vocabulary  relate more to relevant theory  and get a clearer vision of the content of the professional aspects of their work.
Pharmacology,,,Efficient generation  storage  and manipulation of fully flexible pharmacophore multiplets and their use in 3-D similarity searching. Pharmacophore triplets and quartets have been used by many groups in recent years  primarily as a tool for molecular diversity analysis. In most cases  slow processing speeds and the very large size of the bitsets generated have forced researchers to compromise in terms of how such multiplets were stored  manipulated  and compared  e.g.  by using simple unions to represent multiplets for sets of molecules. Here we report using bitmaps in place of bitsets to reduce storage demands and to improve processing speed. Here  a bitset is taken to mean a fully enumerated string of zeros and ones  from which a compressed bitmap is obtained by replacing uniform blocks ("runs") of digits in the bitset with a pair of values identifying the content and length of the block (run-length encoding compression). High-resolution multiplets involving four features are enabled by using 64 bit executables to create and manipulate bitmaps  which "connect" to the 32 bit executables used for database access and feature identification via an extensible mark-up language (XML) data stream. The encoding system used supports simple pairs  triplets  and quartets; multiplets in which a privileged substructure is used as an anchor point; and augmented multiplets in which an additional vertex is added to represent a contingent feature such as a hydrogen bond extension point linked to a complementary feature (e.g.  a donor or an acceptor atom) in a base pair or triplet. It can readily be extended to larger  more complex multiplets as well. Database searching is one particular potential application for this technology. Consensus bitmaps built up from active ligands identified in preliminary screening can be used to generate hypothesis bitmaps  a process which includes allowance for differential weighting to allow greater emphasis to be placed on bits arising from multiplets expected to be particularly discriminating. Such hypothesis bitmaps are shown to be useful queries for database searching  successfully retrieving active compounds across a range of structural classes from a corporate database. The current implementation allows multiconformer bitmaps to be obtained from pregenerated conformations or by random perturbation on-the-fly. The latter application involves random sampling of the full range of conformations not precluded by steric clashes  which limits the usefulness of classical fingerprint similarity measures. A new measure of similarity  The Stochastic Cosine  is introduced here to address this need. This new similarity measure uses the average number of bits common to independently drawn conformer sets to normalize the cosine coefficient. Its use frees the user from having to ensure strict comparability of starting conformations and having to use fixed torsional increments  thereby allowing fully flexible characterization of pharmacophoric patterns.
Evidence-Based Nursing,Geriatric Nursing,Nursing Methodology Research,The process of practice redesign in delirium care for hospitalised older people: a participatory action research study. In 2007 three researchers completed a 6-month study in one 32-bed acute care medical ward in a large hospital in New South Wales  Australia. The problem drawn to the attention of researchers was that approximately 60% of older people were delirious on arrival or develop incident delirium during their hospital stay. Lack of recognition  underreporting and inadequate care responses to delirium in hospitalised older people signalled a major practice problem. To collaboratively explore ways in which clinical practice could be improved. We selected Participatory Action Research (PAR) as the methodology to involve health practitioners in practice redesign. PAR is a process in which 'we'  researchers and participants  systematically work together in cycles of 'looking  thinking and acting'. Delirium and the high percentage of older people who succumb to this condition was the main practice problem requiring a response. Eight volunteer clinicians and three researchers met weekly as a group for 13 sessions over 6 months. Clinicians set the agenda for redesign of practice. Raising awareness about delirium and its prevention were the selected action strategies. A delirium alert protocol was developed for implementation by the clinicians and later evaluation as a separate study. There was evidence that practice had changed. Physical and chemical restraints had not been used for 3 months subsequent to the study's completion. The nurse manager reported that early detection strategies had prevented episodes of acute hyperactive delirium. Whilst there continued to be older people admitted with a diagnosis of delirium  there were fewer incidences of delirium developing on the ward and there was less disruption to other patients  especially at night. The strategy of raising the awareness of delirium in older people was successful. We are confident that working collaboratively with practitioners is the way to bring evidence to practice in delirium care for older people in acute care settings.
Community Health Nursing,,,Managing the self: living with an indwelling urinary catheter. This paper reports the findings of a study that aimed to understand the perspectives of community dwelling adults' who lived with a permanently indwelling urinary catheter. The objectives of the research were to: reveal the participants' perspective of living in the community with a permanent indwelling urinary catheter  raise awareness of the experiences of catheterized men and women and to inform community nursing practice. Catheter care is a common nursing intervention. Clinical Nurse Consultants (CNCs) with a focus on continence drove this inquiry because it was believed that Community Nurses may underestimate the impact that a permanently indwelling catheter may have on peoples' lives. Structured interviews were undertaken with twelve men and nine women (n = 21)  aged between 24 and 82 years and who had a permanently indwelling catheter (either urethral or supra pubic) for longer than six months. Analysis of the interview transcripts was a collaboration between the researchers and clinicians. The most significant finding was that participants wanted to learn urinary catheter self-care as this allowed them to take control and gave relevance to their daily life. Data revealed a learning pattern consisting of seven interrelated themes as people have learned to self-manage: (i) resisting the intrusion of a catheter  (ii) reckoning with the need for a catheter  (iii) being vigilant for signs of problems  (iv) reconciling between the needs of self and others  (v) reclaiming life  (vi) managing self-care  and (vii) taking control. We do not suggest that people undergo a straightforward path toward catheter self-care  rather  that the seven interactive themes we have identified may be useful for observation in nursing practice whilst sensitizing nurses to clients' experiences of living with a catheter. Promoting self-care of a catheter is not simply about educating clients about their condition or giving them relevant information. It is intrinsically a learning process  observing responses to every day events  such as the identification of the different sounds and sensations that may alert the individual to a full catheter bag  urine that has stopped flowing or signs of impending infection.
Nursing Methodology Research,,,The experience of fatigue for adults living with HIV. The aim of this study was to go beyond objective clinical assessment and explore the experience of fatigue and self-care strategies with adults who live with HIV. This study responded to a perceived lack of available evidence to inform the practice of service providers about ways fatigue impacts on the lives of people with HIV. Prior understandings of fatigue are derived from survey or instrument-based tools or studies that do not consider the complexities of the personal experience that in-depth interviews can elicit. The focus remains generally on description  measurement or management from a biomedical perspective. A qualitative study using participatory action research methods was conducted during 2003 with 15 adults diagnosed with HIV who perceived fatigue was a problem in their lives. Data were collected by individual interviews  researcher's notes and two participatory action research groups. Thematic analysis of data demonstrated that fatigue remains silent and invisible to participant's families  friends and employers. Fatigue experienced by people living with HIV generally also met with a lack of acknowledgement and understanding from health professionals. People developed self-care strategies over many years of trial and error. People living with a HIV seek to be acknowledged that fatigue is a legitimate concern  not only by health care professionals  but also people with whom they live. It is imperative that nurses who work with people living with HIV-related fatigue consider the wider social aspects of the person's life as well as physical symptoms. Most importantly  there then needs to be a process of engagement and active listening to the individual's account of their experience of fatigue. Advocating that fatigue is a legitimate complaint to the person living with HIV as well as the wider public and professional community is imperative.
Clinical Nursing Research,Community Health Nursing,,Core elements of programmatic research in nursing: a case study. In this invited paper Tina Koch and Debbie Kralik present the establishment of a research program outside the precincts of a university and we ask Gary Rolfe to provide a commentary from the perspective of an academic. We argue that a dedicated research unit  with a clearly articulated philosophy and in response to research questions from clients  community and practitioners  provides the focus to drive the program. Although we have infrastructure from the RDNS Foundation  obtaining external funding to support our program is a central activity. Discernable outcomes of our collaborative inquiries are described as participants with whom we research narrate aspects of their experience  leading to enhancement of self agency and quality of life. We illustrate the reform potential as groups of research participants develop sustainable people networks. Most importantly  theoretical development is ongoing describing transition (ways in which people are able to take a chronic illness into their lives and move on) and better understanding on ways in which health care professionals can facilitate transition. Evidence based news letters are written in collaboration with practitioners  however we ponder about ways to further our research findings in practice. Gary Rolfe speculates about intermural or extramural research programs. He frames his response using Brand's criteria to research program decisions. In order of importance he asks: (1) will it be fun? (2) will we learn anything from it? (3) will it make the world a better place? (4) will it earn enough money to pay for the first three? Gary argues that one of the luxuries of working within the university sector as an academic is that he can occasionally ignore question four.
Nursing Methodology Research,Nursing Research,,Issues in data generation using email group conversations for nursing research. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the issues we have confronted when generating and analysing dialogue data by using electronic mail. The decision to use email for our research arose from our developing understanding of some of the consequences of illness that people living with chronic illness confront in their lives. As researchers  we recognized the potential of the Internet for computer-mediated communication using email for communication between researchers and research participants. We consider the functional aspects of generating data by email  such as the software needed  and then explore the issues encountered during the research process including ethical considerations  fluctuating participation  participants' familiarity with using email  facilitating lurkers towards participation  establishing group norms  and the role of the facilitator. As a collaborative inquiry  email conversation allowed us to spend time with participants over 2 years to explore chronic illness experience. However the scope and viability of computer-mediated communication as a qualitative method of research remains relatively unexplored  hence this paper.
Nursing Research,,,The ethics of research using electronic mail discussion groups. The aim of this paper is to identify and discuss the ethical considerations that have confronted and challenged the research team when researchers facilitate conversations using private electronic mail discussion lists. The use of electronic mail group conversations  as a collaborative data generation method  remains underdeveloped in nursing. Ethical challenges associated with this approach to data generation have only begun to be considered. As receipt of ethics approval for a study titled; 'Describing transition with people who live with chronic illness' we have been challenged by many ethical dilemmas  hence we believe it is timely to share the issues that have confronted the research team. These discussions are essential so we can understand the possibilities for research interaction  communication  and collaboration made possible by advanced information technologies. Our experiences in this study have increased our awareness for ongoing ethical discussions about privacy  confidentiality  consent  accountability and openness underpinning research with human participants when generating data using an electronic mail discussion group. We describe how we work at upholding these ethical principles focusing on informed consent  participant confidentiality and privacy  the participants as threats to themselves and one another  public-private confusion  employees with access  hackers and threats from the researchers. A variety of complex issues arise during cyberspace research that can make the application of traditional ethical standards troublesome. Communication in cyberspace alters the temporal  spatial and sensory components of human interaction  thereby challenging traditional ethical definitions and calling to question some basic assumptions about identity and ones right to keep aspects of it confidential. Nurse researchers are bound by human research ethics protocols; however  the nature of research by electronic mail generates moral issues as well as ethical concerns. Vigilance by researchers is required to ensure that data are viewed within the scope of the enabling ethics approval.
Evidence-Based Medicine,Nursing Research,,A Delphi study of district nursing research priorities in Australia. This study  using a Delphi approach  sought the opinion of a self-selected panel of 320 district nurses regarding research priorities for district nursing in Australia. Over three rounds of questionnaires  the 419 research clinical problem areas requiring research as suggested by the panel were each rated in importance by the panel and then ranked through analysis from high to low average rating scores  thereby  whittling down the list to the top 15% (68) research questions and to a final list of the top 10 research priorities overall. Research questions focusing on discharge planning are dominant in these top 10 priorities  with documentation issues the second most common focus. Other foci in the top 10 priorities are staffing  aged care  palliative care  and assessment. The organization-specific top 10 research priorities focus on wound care  funding  education  and communication issues. Additionally  the top 68 priorities  which are either finitely practice-based or contextual-issues research questions  were categorized into 20 themes. The results will hopefully lead to scarce human and financial resources being directed to practice-relevant research programs that will facilitate improved health for district nursing (primarily home-nursing) clients in Australia and elsewhere.
Sanitation,,,Household-based prevalence of helminths and parasitic protozoa in rural KwaZulu-Natal  South Africa  assessed from faecal vault sampling. This study was undertaken to examine the family-based prevalence of environmentally persistent parasites in two rural communities of KwaZulu-Natal  South Africa. Samples were collected from 120 urine-diversion family toilets and screened for selected protozoa and helminths with immunomagnetic separation and the ammonium bicarbonate (AMBIC) protocol respectively. The parasites found were Ascaris lumbricoides (59%)  Giardia intestinalis (54%)  Trichuris trichiura (48%)  Cryptosporidium spp. (21%) and Taenia spp. (18%). Only 14% of the household toilets were negative for these pathogens. The occurrence of A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura was lower (P<0.001) in the area with better hygiene behaviour  whereas G. intestinalis was more common (P<0.05) in families with at least one child aged five years or less and in families with more than four persons. Quantification of the parasites per gram was done for each sample and this provided realistic risk assessment data for the reuse of material from urine-diversion toilets. The high occurrence of parasites found in the two communities  in spite of sanitation and hygiene interventions in the areas  suggests an endemicity that will not be reduced without de-worming campaigns. Finally  the study showed that sampling directly from the deposited faecal material may be useful for parasitic prevalence estimations.
Otolaryngology,,,Do patients with chronic rhinosinusitis benefit from consultation with an ENT-doctor? By consulting an ENT-doctor  patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS)  in the general population  receive disease information and adjustment of treatment which can improve disease-specific Quality-of-Life and may improve objective measurements. This study aims to follow persons with clinical diagnosed CRS from the general population  to evaluate their benefit from consultation with an ENT-doctor in terms of severity of symptoms and Quality-of-Life. As part of a trans-European study  selected respondents to a survey questionnaire were invited for a clinical visit. Based on the European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps  persons were diagnosed with CRS and followed for 2 years. Quality-of-Life was measured using the Sino Nasal Outcome Test 22 and European Quality-of-Life - 5 Dimensions. Clinical examination included rhinoscopy  acoustic rhinometry  peak nasal inspiratory flow  smell test  and skin prick test. Out of 91 persons with CRS  only 42% had previously consulted an ENT-doctor  and 51% were in current treatment for CRS. Most patients were advised medical treatment and 20% underwent surgery. Disease-specific Quality-of-Life  peak nasal inspiratory flow  olfactory function  and the nasal volume significantly increased over the 2-year period.
Radiology,,,Interventional treatment of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVM) are congenital vascular communications in the lungs. They act as right to left shunts so that the blood running through these malformations is not oxygenated or filtered. These patients are typically hypoxaemic with exercise intolerance and are at high risk of paradoxical emboli to the brain and other organs. These malformations are most commonly seen in hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) (Mb. Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome). Nowadays  the generally accepted treatment strategy of first choice is embolization of the afferent arteries to the arteriovenous malformations. It is a minimally invasive procedure and at the same time a lung preserving treatment with a very high technical success  high effectiveness and low morbidity and mortality. Embolization prevents cerebral stroke and abscess as well as pulmonary haemorrhage and further raises the functional level. Embolization is a well-established method of treating PAVM  with a significant effect on oxygenation of the blood. Screening for PAVM in patients at risk is recommended  especially in patients with HHT.
Postanesthesia Nursing,,,Should patients walk from the postanesthesia care unit to the general ward after a lumbar discectomy? A randomized study. The aim of this pilot study was to investigate whether it was feasible and safe to mobilize patients shortly after lumbar disc surgery with the objective of reducing postoperative complications and allowing shorter hospitalization. Randomized controlled study. The patients were randomized into two groups  intervention and control groups. Those in the intervention group used a walking frame to walk  with a porter and a nurse  from the postanesthesia care unit to the general ward. Patients in the control group were transported in their beds. The Bournemouth Questionnaire was used to define the various aspects of well-being of the patients. A total of 22 patients were included  11 in each group. Owing to the limited number of patients  statistical comparisons were not performed. However  patients in the walking group were mobilized earlier than the controls  and needed fewer painkillers and less oxygen supplement during the first postoperative day. The length of stay and the number of postoperative complications were similar in the two groups as tested during the three weeks after surgery. This pilot study suggests that it might be feasible and safe to mobilize patients shortly after lumbar disc surgery. There were no indications of an increased number of postoperative complications.
Stroke Rehabilitation,,,Rationale and design of a multicentre  double-blind  prospective  randomized  European and Canadian study: evaluating patient outcomes and costs of managing adults with post-stroke focal spasticity. This report describes the design of a study aiming to provide evidence for the extended use of botulinum toxin A in focal post-stroke upper and lower limb spasticity and to evaluate the impact of incorporating botulinum toxin treatment into the rehabilitation of patients with spasticity. International  prospective  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study with an open-label extension. Approximately 300 adults with a stroke occurring ≥ 3 months before screening  presenting with symptoms and signs of an upper motor neuron syndrome and focal spasticity-related functional impairment  were randomized to botulinum toxin (BOTOX®  Allergan Inc.) + standard care or placebo + standard care. Study medication was administered at baseline and again at Week 12 if required  with follow-up to 52 weeks. The primary endpoint was the number of patients who achieved their investigator-rated principal active functional goal (as measured by Goal Attainment Scaling)  at 10 weeks after the second injection (Weeks 22-34) or at the 24-week visit if no second injection was administered. Secondary endpoints included changes from baseline in level of goal achievement  health-related quality of life and resource utilization. Botulinum toxin A Economic Spasticity Trial (BEST) will provide information regarding clinical and cost-effectiveness of botulinum toxin + standard care vs standard care alone in patients with upper and/or lower limb post-stroke spasticity typically seen in clinical practice. ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT-00549783.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Treatment of the hepatorenal syndrome and hyponatremia in cirrhosis - part II. National guidelines for treatment of ascites  spontaneous bacterial peritonitis  hepatorenal syndrome  and hyponatremia have been approved by the Danish Society of Gastroenterology and Hepatology. Ascites develops in approximately 60% of patients with cirrhosis during a 10 year period and is frequently associated with complications that determine the course of the disease and the prognosis. These evidence-based guidelines are divided in two parts and consider definitions  pathophysiology  diagnostic aspects  treatment  and prophylaxis.

Thoracic Surgery,,,Atrial Na K-ATPase increase and potassium dysregulation accentuate the risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation. Postoperative atrial fibrillation is a common complication to cardiac surgery. Na K-ATPase is of major importance for the resting membrane potential and action potential. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the importance of Na K-ATPase concentrations in human atrial biopsies and plasma potassium concentrations for the development of atrial fibrillation. Atrial myocardial biopsies were obtained from 67 patients undergoing open chest cardiac surgery. Na K-ATPase was quantified using vanadate-facilitated 3H-ouabain binding. Plasma potassium concentration was measured with ion-selective electrode. In patients with preoperative sinus rhythm  3H-ouabain-binding site concentration was 16% higher in patients developing postoperative atrial fibrillation compared to patients maintaining sinus rhythm [302 +/- 15 pmol/g wet weight (n = 20) vs. 261 +/- 11 mmol/g wet weight (n = 33)  p = 0.03]. Also with multivariable analysis  3H-ouabain-binding site concentration was significantly associated with the development of atrial fibrillation. High increase in plasma potassium concentration during the perioperative period and surgery was associated with postoperative atrial fibrillation. The present study supports the increasing evidence of dysregulation of the potassium homeostasis as an important factor in the development of cardiac arrhythmias. High atrial Na K-ATPase and sudden plasma potassium concentration increase may contribute to precipitate atrial fibrillation.
Neurology,,,Boosting enrollment in neurology trials with Local Identification and Outreach Networks (LIONs). Our purpose was to develop a geographically localized  multi-institution strategy for improving enrolment in a trial of secondary stroke prevention. We invited 11 Connecticut hospitals to participate in a project named the Local Identification and Outreach Network (LION). Each hospital provided the names of patients with stroke or TIA  identified from electronic admission or discharge logs  to researchers at a central coordinating center. After obtaining permission from personal physicians  researchers contacted each patient to describe the study  screen for eligibility  and set up a home visit for consent. Researchers traveled throughout the state to enroll and follow participants. Outside the LION  investigators identified trial participants using conventional recruitment strategies. We compared recruitment success for the LION and other sites using data from January 1  2005  through June 30  2007. The average monthly randomization rate from the LION was 4.0 participants  compared with 0.46 at 104 other Insulin Resistance Intervention after Stroke (IRIS) sites. The LION randomized on average 1.52/1 000 beds/month  compared with 0.76/1 000 beds/month at other IRIS sites (p = 0.03). The average cost to randomize and follow one participant was $8 697 for the LION  compared with $7 198 for other sites. A geographically based network of institutions  served by a central coordinating center  randomized substantially more patients per month compared with sites outside of the network. The high enrollment rate was a result of surveillance at multiple institutions and greater productivity at each institution. Although the cost per patient was higher for the network  compared with nonnetwork sites  cost savings could result from more rapid completion of research.
Telemedicine,,,[Telemedicine in the transmission of prehospitalisation ECGs of patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction]. Time to reperfusion is critical to the outcome of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI). Other studies have indicated that wireless transmission of prehospital ECGs can reduce the time to reperfusion. This study evaluated the effect on time to treatment using prehospitalisation ECG transmission to a cardiologist's handheld device in patients with acute chest pain  as well as the potential effect of direct transfer of patients to the closest appropriate cardiological facility. During a one-year study period  prehospitalisation ECGs were transmitted for all patients with symptoms indicative of acute coronary syndrome. The ECGs were received on a handheld device by an attending cardiologist  and the patient was referred to PCI treatment if ST-elevation was found. 152 transmissions were registered; 27 of these patients underwent primary PCI treatment. 135 (89%) of the attempted transmissions were successful. Compared to historic controls  there was an increased on-scene time usage of 7 minutes  including transfer. The median time spent from arrival at the hospital to the start of invasive treatment was low  22 minutes. Compared to historic controls  we found a total reduction in time spent of 72 minutes (p< 0.01). The results indicate that it is possible to minimize the time delay to primary PCI treatment by direct transfer through consultation and use of wireless transmission of prehospitalisation-acquired ECGs to a handheld device carried by an attending cardiologist.
Obstetrics,,,Danish obstetricians' personal preference and general attitude to elective cesarean section on maternal request: a nation-wide postal survey. To assess Danish obstetricians' and gynecologists' personal preference and general attitude towards elective cesarean section on maternal request in uncomplicated single cephalic pregnancies at term. Nation-wide anonymous postal questionnaire. Four hundred and fifty-five obstetricians and gynecologists identified in the records of the Danish Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology from January 2000. Personal preference on the mode of delivery and general attitude towards elective cesarean section on maternal request in an uncomplicated single cephalic pregnancies at term. Of Danish specialists in obstetrics and gynecology  1.1% would prefer an elective cesarean section in an uncomplicated pregnancy at 37 weeks of gestation with fetal weight estimation of 3.0 kg. This rose to 22.5% when the fetal weight estimation was 4.5 kg at 37 weeks. The main reasons given for preferring abdominal deliveries was the risk to the fetus  risks of perineal injury  and urinary and anal incontinence. Of Danish specialists in obstetrics and gynecology  37.6% agreed with a woman's right to have an elective cesarean section on maternal request without any medical indication. Obstetricians and gynecologists who had experienced a noninstrumental vaginal delivery themselves or practiced as a private gynecologist only  were less likely to agree with the woman's right to elective cesarean section on maternal request. The vast majority of Danish obstetricians and gynecologists would personally prefer vaginal delivery in uncomplicated pregnancies  but nearly 40% agree with the woman's right to request a cesarean section.
General Practice,,,Resources allocation and health care needs in diabetes care in Danish GP clinics. In several countries  morbidity burdens have prompted authorities to change the system for allocating resources among patients from a demographic-based to a morbidity-based casemix system. In Danish general practice clinics  there is no morbidity-based casemix adjustment system. The aim of this paper was to assess what proportions of the variation in fee-for-service (FFS) expenditures are explained by type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients' co-morbidity burden and illness characteristics. We use patient morbidity characteristics such as diagnostic markers and co-morbidity casemix adjustments based on resource utilisation bands and FFS expenditures for a sample of 6706 T2DM patients in 59 general practices for the year 2010. We applied a fixed-effect approach. Average annual FFS expenditures were approximately 398 euro per T2DM patient. Expenditures increased progressively with the patients' degree of co-morbidity and were higher for patients who suffered from diagnostic markers. A total of 17-25% of the expenditure variation was explained by age  gender and patients' morbidity patterns. T2DM patient morbidity characteristics are significant patient related FFS expenditure drivers in diabetes care. To address the specific health care needs of T2DM patients in GP clinics  our study indicates that it may be advisable to introduce a morbidity based casemix adjustment system.
Evidence-Based Emergency Medicine,,,[Have the 2005 guidelines for resuscitation been implemented?]. In 2005  new international evidence-based guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) were published by the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR). The aim of these new guidelines is to improve the quality of care and  thereby  the outcome from cardiac arrest. This necessitates that the guidelines are known and implemented in clinical practice. The purpose of this investigation is to elucidate the extent of implementation of Guidelines 2005 (G2005) among doctors on Cardiac Arrest Teams (CAT) one year after the publication. In addition  the date of implementation is examined among medical emergency services and major providers of basic life support (BLS) courses. A telephone enquiry about CPR among CAT doctors on-duty. Ambulance services and BLS-course providers are contacted by e-mail. Approximately 70% of the doctors were able to answer simple and essential topics on CPR  e.g. compression/ventilation ratio and the number of shocks in a sequence in accordance with G2005. The ambulance service  Falck A/S  implemented G2005 during 2007  while the other ambulance services implemented G2005 within six months after publication. The majority of BLS-course providers implemented the guidelines one year after their publication. One year after the publication of G2005  there is limited knowledge of the guidelines among doctors on duty. The study does not give any explanation for the lack of implementation. The barriers to implementation should be clarified  and future guidelines should be accompanied by an active strategy for implementation.
Specialties  Surgical,,,[Recruiting medical students for the surgical education]. For a longer period the interest for surgical education in Denmark has been low measured in the number of junior doctors choosing a surgical career. The Danish Surgical Society has reviewed the published data describing the factors involved when selecting a surgical career.
Stroke Rehabilitation,,,[Rehabilitation of stroke patients]. The introduction of stroke units is the only well-documented cause of reduced stroke mortality during the latest decades. Factors affecting rehabilitation outcome in terms of activities of daily living includes hemiplegia  urinary and fecal incontinence  cognitive deficits and anosognosia. Physiotherapy  speech therapy and cognitive rehabilitation are indicated whenever the relevant symptoms are present  although there is insufficient knowledge of the relative efficiency of competing methods.
General Practice,,,Use of primary care during the year before childhood cancer diagnosis: a nationwide population-based matched comparative study. Childhood cancer is rare and symptoms tend to be unspecific and vague. Using the utilization of health care services as a proxy for symptoms  the present study seeks to determine when early symptoms of childhood cancer are seen in general practice. A population-based matched comparative study was conducted using nationwide registry data. As cases  all children in Denmark below 16 years of age (N = 1 278) diagnosed with cancer (Jan 2002-Dec 2008) were included. As controls  10 children per case matched on gender and date of birth (N = 12 780) were randomly selected. The utilization of primary health care services (daytime contacts  out-of-hours contacts and diagnostic procedures) during the year preceding diagnosis/index date was measured for cases and controls. During the six months before diagnosis  children with cancer used primary care more than the control cohort. This excess use grew consistently and steadily towards the time of diagnosis with an IRR = 3.19 (95%CI: 2.99-3.39) (p<0.0001) during the last three months before diagnosis. Children with Central Nervous System (CNS) tumours had more contacts than other children during the entire study period. The use of practice-based diagnostic tests and the number of out-of-hours contacts began to increase four to five months before cancer diagnosis. The study shows that excess health care use  a proxy for symptoms of childhood cancer  occurs months before the diagnosis is established. Children with lymphoma  bone tumour or other solid tumours had higher consultation rates than the controls in the last five months before diagnosis  whereas children with CNS tumour had higher consultation rates in all twelve months before diagnosis. More knowledge about early symptoms and the diagnostic pathway for childhood cancer would be clinically relevant.
General Practice,,,Presenting symptoms of children with cancer: a primary-care population-based study. Knowledge of how children with cancer present in general practice is sparse. Timely referral from general practice is important to ensure early diagnosis. To investigate the presenting symptoms and GPs' interpretations of symptoms of children with cancer. A Danish nationwide population-based study including children (<15 years) with an incident cancer diagnosis (January 2007 to December 2010). A questionnaire on symptoms and their interpretation was mailed to GPs (n=363). Symptoms were classified according to the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC)-2 classification. GPs' response rate was 87% (315/363) and GPs were involved in the diagnostic process of 253 (80.3%) children. Symptoms were few (2.4 per child) and most fell into the category 'general and unspecified' (71.9%)  apart from patients with tumours of the central nervous system (CNS)  whose symptoms fell mostly in the category 'neurological' (for example  headache). Symptoms like pain  swelling/lump  or fatigue were reported in 25% of the patients and they were the most commonly reported symptoms. GPs interpreted children's symptoms as alarm symptoms in 20.2%  as serious (that is  not alarm) symptoms in 52.9%  and as vague symptoms in 26.9%. GPs' interpretation varied significantly by diagnosis (P<0.001). Children with cancer presented with few symptoms in general practice  of which most were 'general and unspecified' symptoms. Only 20% presented alarm symptoms  while 27% presented vague and non-specific symptoms. This low level of alarm symptoms may influence the time from symptom presentation in general practice to final diagnosis.
Epidemiology,,,Mortality in ankylosing spondylitis: results from a nationwide population-based study. Information on mortality in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is scarce. Our study therefore aimed to assess: (1) mortality in AS versus the general population  and (2) predictors of death in the AS population. Nationwide cohorts of patients with AS diagnosed at rheumatology or internal medicine outpatient clinics (n=8600) and age-matched  sex-matched and county-matched general population comparators (n=40 460) were identified from the National Patient Register and the census register  respectively. The follow-up period began on 1 January 2006 or at the first date of registered diagnosis thereafter and extended until death  emigration or 31 December 2012  whichever occurred first. Socioeconomic variables  AS-related clinical manifestations  joint surgery  comorbidities and medication were identified from other national registers. Cox regression models were used to determine mortality and predictors for death in the AS cohort. There were 496 deaths in the AS cohort and 1533 deaths in the control cohort resulting in an age-adjusted and sex-adjusted HR of 1.60 (95% CI 1.44 to 1.77)  with increased mortality for men (age-adjusted HR=1.53  95% CI 1.36 to 1.72) and women (age-adjusted HR=1.83  95% CI 1.50 to 2.22). Within the AS cohort  statistically significant predictors for death were a lower level of education  general comorbidities (diabetes  infections  cardiovascular  pulmonary and malignant diseases) and previous hip replacement surgery. Mortality was increased for male and female patients with AS. Predictors of death within the AS cohort included socioeconomic status  general comorbidities and hip replacement surgery.
Pathology,,,In vivo detection of microstructural correlates of brain pathology in preclinical and early Alzheimer Disease with magnetic resonance imaging. Alzheimer disease (AD) affects at least 5 million individuals in the USA alone stimulating an intense search for disease prevention and treatment therapies as well as for diagnostic techniques allowing early identification of AD during a long pre-symptomatic period that can be used for the initiation of prevention trials of disease-modifying therapies in asymptomatic individuals. Our approach to developing such techniques is based on the Gradient Echo Plural Contrast Imaging (GEPCI) technique that provides quantitative in vivo measurements of several brain-tissue-specific characteristics of the gradient echo MRI signal (GEPCI metrics) that depend on the integrity of brain tissue cellular structure. Preliminary data were obtained from 34 participants selected from the studies of aging and dementia at the Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at Washington University in St. Louis. Cognitive status was operationalized with the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale. The participants  assessed as cognitively normal (CDR=0; n=23) or with mild AD dementia (CDR=0.5 or 1; n=11) underwent GEPCI MRI  a collection of cognitive performance tests and CSF amyloid (Aβ) biomarker Aβ42. A subset of 19 participants also underwent PET PiB studies to assess their brain Aβ burden. According to the Aβ status  cognitively normal participants were divided into normal (Aβ negative; n=13) and preclinical (Aβ positive; n=10) groups. GEPCI quantitative measurements demonstrated significant differences between all the groups: normal and preclinical  normal and mild AD  and preclinical and mild AD. GEPCI quantitative metrics characterizing tissue cellular integrity in the hippocampus demonstrated much stronger correlations with psychometric tests than the hippocampal atrophy. Importantly  GEPCI-determined changes in the hippocampal tissue cellular integrity were detected even in the hippocampal areas not affected by the atrophy. Our studies also uncovered strong correlations between GEPCI brain tissue metrics and beta-amyloid (Aβ) burden defined by positron emission tomography (PET) - the current in vivo gold standard for detection of cortical Aβ  thus supporting GEPCI as a potential surrogate marker for Aβ imaging - a known biomarker of early AD. Remarkably  the data show significant correlations not only in the areas of high Aβ accumulation (e.g. precuneus) but also in some areas of medial temporal lobe (e.g. parahippocampal cortex)  where Aβ accumulation is relatively low. We have demonstrated that GEPCI provides a new approach for the in vivo evaluation of AD-related tissue pathology in the preclinical and early symptomatic stages of AD. Since MRI is a widely available technology  the GEPCI surrogate markers of AD pathology have a potential for improving the quality of AD diagnostic  and the evaluation of new disease-modifying therapies.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[No evidence for renal protective effect of loop diuretics for patients having oliguria]. In many intensive care units  loop diuretics are used more or less routinely to achieve a urinary output above 1 ml/kg/h in critically ill patients. We do not in the literature find any basis of this strategy. In contrast  this practice may cause a risk of circulatory instability in the critically ill patient due to large diuresis and volume depletion. There is no evidence so far that the use of loop diuretics has a renal protective effect or any other beneficial impact on the renal function. The use of loop diuretics in oliguric critically ill patients may be harmful. Consequently an individual assessment is required.
Pediatrics,,,[Considerations in ventilation of infants and children]. The oxygen reserves of infants are low because of high oxygen demand in combination with low transport capacity. Respiratory adverse events are one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality during paediatric anaesthesia. During the last years our knowledge has grown substantially about the influence of artificial airways on the airway of paediatric patients. Modern anaesthetic concepts in infants and children include the use of cuffed tubes as well as a spontaneous breathing child.
Evidence-Based Practice,,,[Infection control to prevent tuberculosis in relation to resistance to antibiotics]. Infection control differs among nations. Notably in USA strict measures are enforced to prevent air-borne tuberculosis (TB) transmission. In several European countries focus is on droplet transmission  close to patients. In the absence of strict evidence to resolve this divergence  an empiric  Danish guideline for infection control in hospitals is presented. If multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB is documented or suspected  according to risk-factors  patients should remain under air-borne precautions. The vast majority of Danish TB-patients (non-MDR) require less demanding  hygienic precautions.
Forensic Psychiatry,,,[Ethical consequences of the diagnosis of psychosis]. Psychosis is defined by the loss of reality testing. Apart from that  it is rather broadly and vaguely defined. Ethics is the art of defining what is right and what is wrong. Medical ethics apply a diversity of ethical principles to a complex clinical reality after discussion and consideration. In forensic psychiatry the diagnosis of psychosis has vast ethical implications. In the Danish law on psychiatry conditions for coercion and involuntary treatment are stated  and in the law on penalty the principle of treatment instead of penalty is stated. Thus  implications for diagnoses and treatment go far beyond other medical diagnoses.
Psychiatry,,,Current issues in Scandinavian acute psychiatric wards. The aim of the paper is to provide an overview of some of the most important issues faced by acute inpatient facilities in three Scandinavian countries  including reflections and critical remarks for discussion in this field. Information was drawn from scientific articles and official reports published in recent years  as well as the authors' own knowledge of acute facilities in their home countries. Acute inpatient facilities  including General Hospital Psychiatric Units (GHPUs)  in all Scandinavian countries have several issues and problems in common  which include the organisation and capacity of acute services  the assessment of dangerousness and suicidality  the use of coercion and efforts to reduce coercion  the need to define and improve the quality of acute services  and the necessity to improve collaboration and continuity between acute services and other services. Although the emphasis some of these issues receive can vary across the three countries  Scandinavian mental health professionals (and policy makers) have begun to systematically share their experiences in developing a growing spirit of collaboration. Despite the role of welfare state and the deployment of substantial resources in Scandinavian countries  mental health practitioners are struggling to implement best practices in acute wards  to develop differentiated forms of acute services  and to reach the right balance and coordination between acute services and other services.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Work at night and breast cancer--report on evidence-based options for preventive actions. In 2007  the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified shift work involving circadian disruption as probably carcinogenic to humans (group 2A)  primarily based on experimental and epidemiologic evidence for breast cancer. In order to examine options for evidence-based preventive actions  16 researchers in basic  epidemiological and applied sciences convened at a workshop in Copenhagen 26-27 October 2011. This paper summarizes the evidence from epidemiological and experimental studies and presents possible recommendations for prevention of the effects of night work on breast cancer. Among those studies that quantified duration of shift work  there were statistically significant elevations in risk only after about 20 years working night shift. It is unclear from these studies whether or not there is a modest but real elevated risk for shorter durations. Hence  restriction of the total number of years working night shift could be one future preventive recommendation for shift workers. The diurnal secretion of melatonin by the pineal gland with peak in secretory activity during the night is a good biochemical marker of the circadian rhythm. Disruption of the diurnal melatonin secretion pattern can be diminished by restricting the number of consecutive night shifts. Reddish light and reduced light intensity during work at night could potentially help diminish the inhibitory activity of light with strong intensity on the melatonin secretion  but further mechanistic insight is needed before definite recommendations can be made. Earlier or more intensive mammography screening among female night shift worker is not recommended because the harm-benefit ratio in this age group may not be beneficial. Preventive effects of melatonin supplementation on breast cancer risk have not been clearly documented  but may be a promising avenue if a lack of side effects can be shown even after long-term ingestion. Women with previous or current breast cancer should be advised not to work night shifts because of strong experimental evidence demonstrating accelerated tumor growth by suppression of melatonin secretion. Work during the night is widespread worldwide. To provide additional evidence-based recommendations on prevention of diseases related to night shift work  large studies on the impact of various shift schedules and type of light on circadian rhythms need to be conducted in real work environments.
Occupational Medicine,,,Salivary cortisol and sleep problems among civil servants. The present study used information from a field study conducted among 4489 civil servants (70% women) in Denmark in 2007. The purpose was to examine the association between sleep problems and salivary cortisol by using a cross-sectional design with repeated measures in a subsample three-month later. Sleep problems during the past night and the past 4 weeks were assessed by a self-administered questionnaire on overall sleep quality  disturbed sleep  sleep length and awakening problems. Saliva samples were collected in a single day  using cotton tubes  30 min after awakening and again at 2000 h. A subsample of 387 participants collected saliva samples three-month later at awakening  +20 min and +40 min after awakening and at 2000 h. We adjusted for confounders related to sampling time  life style and personal characteristics  socioeconomic status and work aspects. Sleep problems during the past four weeks were associated with low morning and evening saliva cortisol concentrations: [-3.1% per score of disturbed sleep (p=.009); and -4.7% per score of awakening problems (p<.001)]. Whereas sleep problems were not related with slope (the morning to evening change in cortisol levels). Awakening problems predicted lower cortisol (-7.51% per score; p=.003) three-month later. Cortisol awakening response (CAR) and slope three-month later were significantly associated with disturbed sleep (-7.84% and -8.24%) and awakening problems (-6.93). Area under the curve (AUC(morning)) increased with disturbed sleep (3.77%). Surprisingly  low morning cortisol was associated with increased sleep problems during a four-week period prior to sampling among 4066 Danish civil servants. At follow-up three-month later  those with sleep problems had a flattened cortisol profile. Those with awakening problems also had low salivary cortisol in general.
Clinical Nursing Research,,,A comparison between infrared tympanic thermometry  oral and axilla with rectal thermometry in neutropenic adults. This study assessed the agreement between infrared tympanic membrane (TM)  axillary  corrected axillary (+0.5 degrees C)  oral  and corrected oral (+0.3 degrees C) to rectal thermometry as reference standard in neutropenic adults. The sensitivity and specificity of the mentioned thermometries in detecting rectal fever (> or =38 degrees C) were also analysed. This is a comparative diagnostic test study. A total of 400 sets of blinded simultaneous temperature readings were measured from 21 haemato-oncology in-patients with neutropenia following chemotherapy. Three-hundred sets were then randomly sampled. Agreements were analysed using random two-way intraclass correlation (ICC). Sensitivity and specificity were analysed using contingency 2x2 table. Both right and left TM thermometry have good correlation with rectal thermometry; 0.810 (95% CI  0.748-0.855) and 0.770 (95% CI  0.713-0.815) respectively. Axilla thermometry has weak agreement (ICC 0.486 (95% CI  0.118-0.689)) with rectal thermometry. The sensitivity (sn) and specificity (sp) in detecting rectal fever (> or =38 degrees C) were: right TM (sn) 0.712 (95% CI  0.586-0.814)  (sp) 0.957 (95% CI  0.920-0.978); oral (sn) 0.561 (95% CI  0.433-0.681)  (sp) 0.983 (95% CI  0.954-0.995); and axilla (sn) 0.348 (95% CI  0.238-0.477)  (sp) 0.996 (95% CI  0.973-0.999). Single tympanic membrane thermometry is in good agreement with rectal thermometry. It is more sensitive than oral or axillary thermometry in detecting rectal fever.
Neonatology,,,Gynecologic cancers in pregnancy: guidelines of a second international consensus meeting. This study aimed to provide timely and effective guidance for pregnant women and health care providers to optimize maternal treatment and fetal protection and to promote effective management of the mother  fetus  and neonate when administering potentially teratogenic medications. New insights and more experience were gained since the first consensus meeting 5 years ago. Members of the European Society of Gynecological Oncology task force "Cancer in Pregnancy" in concert with other international experts reviewed the existing literature on their respective areas of expertise. The summaries were subsequently merged into a complete article that served as a basis for discussion during the consensus meeting. All participants approved the final article. In the experts' view  cancer can be successfully treated during pregnancy in collaboration with a multidisciplinary team  optimizing maternal treatment while considering fetal safety. To maximize the maternal outcome  cancer treatment should follow a standard treatment protocol as for nonpregnant patients. Iatrogenic prematurity should be avoided. Individualization of treatment and effective psychologic support is imperative to provide throughout the pregnancy period. Diagnostic procedures  including staging examinations and imaging  such as magnetic resonance imaging and sonography  are preferable. Pelvic surgery  either open or laparoscopic  as part of a treatment protocol  may reveal beneficial outcomes and is preferably performed by experts. Most standard regimens of chemotherapy can be administered from 14 weeks gestational age onward. Apart from cervical and vulvar cancer  as well as important vulvar scarring  the mode of delivery is determined by the obstetrician. Term delivery is aimed for. Breast-feeding should be considered based on individual drug safety and neonatologist-breast-feeding expert's consult. Despite limited evidence-based information  cancer treatment during pregnancy can succeed. State-of-the-art treatment should be provided for this vulnerable population to preserve maternal and fetal prognosis. Supplementary data on teratogenic effects  ionizing examinations  sentinel lymph node biopsy  tumor markers during pregnancy  as well as additional references and tables are available at the extended online version of this consensus article  go to http://links.lww.com/IGC/A197.
Molecular Epidemiology,,,Giardia duodenalis genotypes among schoolchildren and their families and pets in urban and rural areas of Sinaloa  Mexico. Giardiasis is a human health concern worldwide  especially among schoolchildren. Giardia duodenalis genotypes A and B are infective to humans  but their zoonotic potential remains controversial. In Mexico  the most prevalent genotype is A  but B was also detected in southeastern Mexico. In Sinaloa state  northwestern Mexico  giardiasis is highly prevalent  but Giardia genotypes have been poorly studied. This study aimed to investigate the distribution and clinical-epidemiological correlation of G. duodenalis genotypes in schoolchildren and their families and pets in urban and rural areas of Sinaloa state  Mexico. Among 395 schoolchildren (274 urban  121 rural)  76 (49 urban  27 rural) were infected with G. duodenalis. In total  22 families (15 urban  7 rural) of infected schoolchildren  consisting of 60 family members (41 urban  19 rural) and 21 pet dogs (15 urban  6 rural) were examined; 10 family members (5 urban  5 rural) and 5 pet dogs (3 urban  2 rural) of 10 families (6 urban  4 rural) were infected. After PCR-RFLP analyses of vsp417 and gdh genes  genotype prevalence among infected urban schoolchildren was 79.5% AI  12.8% AII  and 7.7% mixed AI+B. However  only AI genotype was found in family members and pets. In the rural area  only the AI genotype was detected. Genotypes were not correlated with clinical manifestations. This paper shows the presence of B genotype in northwestern Mexico for the first time. Detection of AI genotype in dogs suggested the possible role of dogs as the reservoir for human giardiasis in Sinaloa  Mexico.
Acupuncture,Herbal Medicine,,Acupuncture and Traditional Herbal Medicine Therapy Prevent Deliriumin Patients with Cardiovascular Disease in Intensive Care Units. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of combination therapy consisting of acupuncture and traditional herbal medicine (Kampo medicine) for reducing the incidence rate of delirium in patients with cardiovascular (CV) disease in ICUs. Twenty-nine patients who had been urgently admitted to the ICU in the control period were treated with conventional intensive care. Thirty patients in the treatment period received conventional therapy plus a combination therapy consisting of acupuncture and herbal medicine. Acupuncture treatment was performed once a day  and the herbal formula was administered orally three times a day during the first week of the ICU stay. The standard acupuncture points were GV20  Ex-HN3  HT7  LI4  Liv3  and KI3  and the main herbal preparation was Kamikihito. The incident rates of delirium  assessed using the confusion assessment method for ICU  in the treatment and control period were compared. The incidence rate of delirium was significantly lower in the treatment group than in the control group (6.6% vs. 37.9%  [Formula: see text]). Moreover  sedative drugs and non-pharmacological approaches against aggressive behavior of patients who were delirious were used less in the treatment group than in the control group. No serious adverse events were observed in the treatment group. Combination therapy consisting of acupuncture and herbal medicine was found to be effective in lowering the incidence of delirium in patients with CV disease in ICUs. Further studies with a large sample size and parallel randomized controlled design would be required to establish the effects of this therapy.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Traditions and myths in hip and knee arthroplasty. Traditions are passed on from experienced surgeons to younger fellows and become "the right way to do it". Traditions associated with arthroplasty surgery may  however  not be evidence-based and may be potentially deleterious to both patients and society  increasing morbidity and mortality  slowing early functional recovery  and increasing cost. We identified selected traditions and performed a literature search using relevant search criteria (June 2014). We present a narrative review grading the studies according to evidence  and we suggest some lines of future research. We present traditions and evaluate them against the published evidence. Preoperative removal of hair  urine testing for bacteria  use of plastic adhesive drapes intraoperatively  and prewarming of the operation room should be abandoned-as should use of a tourniquet  a space suit  a urinary catheter  and closure of the knee in extension. The safety and efficacy of tranexamic acid is supported by meta-analyses. Postoperatively  there is no evidence to support postponement of showering or postponement of changing of dressings to after 48 h. There is no evidence to recommend routine dental antibiotic prophylaxis  continuous passive motion (CPM)  the use of compression stockings  cooling for pain control or reduction of swelling  flexion of at least 90 degrees as a discharge criterion following TKA  or having restrictions after THA. We present evidence supporting the use of NSAIDs  early mobilization  allowing early travel  and a low hemoglobin trigger for transfusion. Revision of traditions and myths surrounding hip and knee arthroplasty towards more contemporary evidence-based principles can be expected to improve early functional recovery  thus reducing morbidity  mortality  and costs.
Family Practice,,,[Diagnosis and treatment of depression in general practice. A questionnaire study]. The purpose of this questionnaire study was to assess the knowledge and attitude of general practitioners (GPs) towards the use of diagnostic criteria in clinical practice  and the extent to which diagnostic tools are used as a prerequisite for the treatment of depressive patients in general practice. A total of 758 out of 1 700 randomly selected GPs responded to the questionnaire. The GPs' demographic data (age  sex  number of years in practice  supplementary education)  diagnostic practice (knowledge of depressive core symptoms and diagnostic tools and scales)  and clinical practice (assessment of the effectiveness of treatment  duration of treatment  aim of treatment  and use of psychotherapy) were registered. The study showed that GPs  who had taken part in supplementary training in psychiatric issues within the preceding year  to a higher extent than the rest of the GPs used diagnostic tools for all or most patients. This group of GPs also had a significantly greater knowledge of the depressive core symptoms as described in the ICD-10. When compared with the other group of GPs  they also felt themselves more confident of the diagnosis of depression before prescribing antidepressive medication. The vast majority of both groups felt that many depressive patients remained undiagnosed  because they simply do not consult their GPs. They also found that it was often questionable whether the symptoms were caused by life crisis or depression--and whether or not the depressive symptoms of these patients required drug treatment. The questionnaire study shows that the GPs' level of knowledge of diagnostics of depression is insufficient. There is an obvious need for supplementary training in general practice  thereby increasing the knowledge and the use of diagnostic criteria in order to make diagnoses of depression more correct and to improve treatment.
Global Health,,,[New European model for cross-sectorial health initiatives]. Over the last years EU have been working on the development of a common classification system for health indicators. In connection with prevention and health promotion  a classification system has now been developed: the European Health Promotion Indicator Development  EUHPID. The purpose has been to establish a system of indicators to advance the focus on health promotion. Furthermore  the EUHPID can be used as a planning tool to generate higher consistency between different health promotion initiatives and other policy initiatives. This article discusses the model and its relevance in a Danish context.
Public Health,,,Nickel and cobalt allergy before and after nickel regulation--evaluation of a public health intervention. Over the 20th century  the frequent use of nickel in consumer products resulted in an increasing prevalence of nickel allergy. Risk items included suspenders in the 1950s-1960s; buttons  zippers and rivets in the 1970s; and ear-piercing jewellery in the 1980s. When subjects allergic to nickel were exposed to nickel in high concentrations  it often resulted in allergic nickel contact dermatitis and hand eczema. In 1990  the Danish government began to regulate consumer nickel exposure as a response to the increasing nickel allergy problem. In 1994  the EU Nickel Directive was passed  a regulation that was based on the Danish and Swedish nickel regulations. These major public health interventions were expected to change the epidemiology of nickel allergy and dermatitis in Europe. Furthermore  it was debated whether nickel would be replaced by cobalt in inexpensive jewellery and result in higher prevalence of cobalt allergy. An evaluation of the possible effects of the European nickel regulations is of importance to ensure protection of consumers and dermatitis patients. This doctoral thesis aimed to evaluate the effects of regulatory interventions on nickel exposure by investigating the development of nickel allergy and dermatitis before and after nickel regulation. Furthermore  a change in the association between nickel allergy and hand eczema was evaluated. The nickel spot test was validated to determine its value when used for screening purposes. Possible explanations for the persistence of nickel allergy were explored including genetic predisposition and consumer nickel exposure from jewellery and accessories. A cobalt spot test was developed and validated. Finally  it was evaluated whether a cobalt allergy epidemic had replaced the nickel allergy epidemic after nickel regulation in terms of increasing cobalt sensitization and cobalt exposure. The thesis showed that the prevalence of nickel allergy decreased significantly after nickel regulation in young Danish women from the general population (18-35 years) and in young Danish female dermatitis patients from a university patch test clinic (0-30 years). Stratification by ear-piercing status revealed that women ear pierced before 1990 had a significantly higher prevalence of nickel allergy and dermatitis than women ear pierced after 1990. Furthermore  the association between hand eczema and nickel allergy decreased in young women aged 18-35 years when a comparison was made between women who were patch tested and questioned in  respectively  1990 and 2006. Despite the decreasing prevalence of nickel allergy  this condition remains prevalent in young Danish women  as about 10% are nickel allergic. Genetic predisposition to nickel allergy was evaluated by investigating the possible association between filaggrin null mutation status and nickel allergy. A positive association was found but it was also concluded that environmental nickel exposure is of much greater importance. Thus  of 354 consumer items purchased from 36 different stores in Copenhagen  22% released nickel in concentrations that may result in nickel dermatitis in sensitized subjects. Therefore excessive consumer nickel exposure remains common in Denmark and may be an important explanation for the persistence of nickel allergy. Excessive nickel release was also frequent when samples of earrings purchased in Warsaw and London were examined with the nickel spot test  in particular earrings purchased from street markets and shops with independent ownership. Only very weak indications of an emerging cobalt allergy epidemic were found  as the prevalence of cobalt allergy has not yet increased in young people and only four of 354 consumer items purchased in Copenhagen released cobalt in concentrations that may result in cobalt dermatitis in sensitized individuals. The specificity of the nickel spot test was 98% and the sensitivity 59%. Also  a cobalt spot test was developed and validated and seemed to be a useful diagnostic tool. In conclusion  the Danish nickel regulation and the EU Nickel Directive have changed the epidemiology of nickel allergy in Denmark. However  the Nickel Directive and its reference methods need to be revised to better protect consumers and dermatitis patients.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Scandinavian guidelines for prehospital management of severe traumatic brain injury]. Head trauma is the cause the death for many young persons. The number of fatalities can be reduced through systematic management. Prevention of secondary brain injury combined with the fastest possible transport to a neurosurgical unit  have been shown to effectively reduce mortality and morbidity. Evidence-based guidelines already exist that focus on all steps in the process. In the present article members of the Scandinavian Neurotrauma Committee present recommendations on prehospital management of traumatic brain injury adapted to the infrastructure of the Nordic region.

General Practice,,,Hospital-based versus community-based shared care cardiac rehabilitation after acute coronary syndrome: protocol for a randomized clinical trial. Participation in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is poor although CR reduces morbidity and mortality. One way in which attendance may potentially be improved is by involving municipal health-care centres (MHCC) and the patient's general practitioner (GP) to a larger degree in a model of shared care cardiac rehabilitation (SC-CR). Our study tests the feasibility of SC-CR and compares the attendance and effects of SC-CR with the individually tailored hospital-based CR (H-CR) programme. After admission for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients are randomized to phase II CR which is conducted either as SC-CR or H-CR. During SC-CR the patient is seen once in-hospital after which the GP takes over. MHCC supports the GP by offering educational intervention regarding smoking cessation  exercise  nutrition and mental health. A total of 208 persons hospitalised due to acute coronary syndrome are to be randomized before hospital discharge. The study aims to examine whether the organisation of SC-CR is feasible and provides the expected benefits. The trial is funded by Region Central Denmark. Clinical Trials ID: NTC 01522001.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Incidence of bleeding in 'real-life' acute coronary syndrome patients treated with antithrombotic therapy. Randomized clinical trials have reported low risks of bleeding in non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) patients receiving triple antithrombotic treatment (aspirin  clopidogrel and heparin). As trial patients often differ substantially from unselected patients treated in routine clinical settings  we compared the incidence of bleeding in 'real-life patients' with the incidence in the CURE (Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent Recurrent Events) trial. We conducted a historical follow-up study based on 195 nonselected patients diagnosed with NSTE-ACS admitted to a Danish hospital. Data were obtained through systematic review of medical records. Bleeding complications were registered for 6 months after the event. One hundred and nineteen (61.0%) patients fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the CURE trial and were treated with triple antithrombotic therapy. Eleven (9.2%) of the 119 patients suffered a life-threatening bleeding. Their relative risk of life-threatening bleeding was 4.3 (95% CI 2.4-7.7) compared with the CURE study population. There was no difference in minor bleeding. Among patients not eligible according to the CURE criteria  but receiving intensive antithrombotic treatment  the relative risk of life-threatening bleeding was 6.4 (95% CI 3.1-12.9). When triple antithrombotic therapy is used in clinical practice in NSTE-ACS patients  the risk of bleeding may exceed that reported in trials. Assessment of the bleeding risk in the individual patient is warranted.
Rehabilitation,,,Electrical somatosensory stimulation followed by motor training of the paretic upper limb in acute stroke: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial. Upper limb paresis is one of the most frequent and persistent impairments following stroke. Only 12-34% of stroke patients achieve full recovery of upper limb functioning  which seems to be required to habitually use the affected arm in daily tasks. Although the recovery of upper limb functioning is most pronounced during the first 4 weeks post stroke  there are few studies investigating the effect of rehabilitation during this critical time window. The purpose of this trial is to determine the effect of electrical somatosensory stimulation (ESS) initiated in the acute stroke phase on the recovery of upper limb functioning in a nonselected sample of stroke patients. A sample of 102 patients with upper limb paresis of varying degrees of severity is assigned to either the intervention or the control group using stratified random sampling. The intervention group receives ESS plus usual rehabilitation and the control group receives sham ESS plus usual rehabilitation. The intervention is applied as 1 h of ESS/sham ESS daily  followed by motor training of the affected upper limb. The ESS/sham ESS treatment is initiated within 7 days from stroke onset and it is delivered during hospitalization  but no longer than 4 weeks post stroke. The primary outcome is hand dexterity assessed by the Box and Block Test; secondary outcomes are the Fugl-Meyer Assessment  hand grip strength  pinch strength  perceptual threshold of touch  degree of pain  and modified Rankin Scale score. Outcome measurements are conducted at baseline  post intervention and at 6-month follow-up. Because of the wide inclusion criteria  we believe that the results can be generalized to the larger population of patients with a first-ever stroke who present with an upper limb paresis of varying severity. On the other hand  the sample size (n = 102) may preclude subgroup analyses in such a heterogeneous sample. The sham ESS treatment totals a mere 2% of the active ESS treatment delivered to the intervention group per ESS session  and we consider that this dose is too small to induce a treatment effect.

Epidemiology,,,Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in children and adolescents: incidences  outcomes  and household socioeconomic status. There is insufficient knowledge of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in the very young. This nationwide study sought to examine age-stratified OHCA characteristics and the role of parental socioeconomic differences and its contribution to mortality in the young population. All OHCA patients in Denmark  ≤21 years of age  were identified from 2001 to 2010. The population was divided into infants (<1 year); pre-school children (1-5 years); school children (6-15 years); and high school adolescents/young adults (16-21 years). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to investigate associations between pre-hospital factors and study endpoints: return of spontaneous circulation and survival. A total of 459 individuals were included. Overall incidence of OHCA was 3.3 per 100 000 inhabitants per year. The incidence rates for infants  pre-school children  school children and high school adolescents were 11.5  3.5  1.3 and 5.3 per 100 000 inhabitants. Overall bystander CPR rate was 48.8%  and for age groups: 55.4%  41.2%  44.9% and 63.0%  respectively. Overall 30-day survival rate was 8.1%  and for age groups: 1.4%  4.5%  16.1% and 9.3%  respectively. High parental education was associated with improved survival after OHCA (OR 3.48  CI 1.27-9.41). Significant crude difference in survival (OR 3.18  CI 1.22-8.34) between high household incomes vs. low household incomes was found. OHCA incidences and survival rates varied significantly between age groups. High parental education was found to be associated with improved survival after OHCA.
Genetics  Medical,,,Sex differences in heritability of BMI: a comparative study of results from twin studies in eight countries. Body mass index (BMI)  a simple anthropometric measure  is the most frequently used measure of adiposity and has been instrumental in documenting the worldwide increase in the prevalence of obesity witnessed during the last decades. Although this increase in overweight and obesity is thought to be mainly due to environmental changes  i.e.  sedentary lifestyles and high caloric diets  consistent evidence from twin studies demonstrates high heritability and the importance of genetic differences for normal variation in BMI. We analysed self-reported data on BMI from approximately 37 000 complete twin pairs (including opposite sex pairs) aged 20-29 and 30-39 from eight different twin registries participating in the GenomEUtwin project. Quantitative genetic analyses were conducted and sex differences were explored. Variation in BMI was greater for women than for men  and in both sexes was primarily explained by additive genetic variance in all countries. Sex differences in the variance components were consistently significant. Results from analyses of opposite sex pairs also showed evidence of sex-specific genetic effects suggesting there may be some differences between men and women in the genetic factors that influence variation in BMI. These results encourage the continued search for genes of importance to the body composition and the development of obesity. Furthermore  they suggest that strategies to identify predisposing genes may benefit from taking into account potential sex specific effects.
Public Health,,,The Danish National Cohort Study (DANCOS). The Danish National Cohort Study (DANCOS) is a nationally representative public health survey based on linkage of information in the repeated Danish Health Interview surveys  1986-2005  to the national Danish registers on health and welfare. It facilitates studies of self-reported health behaviour and utilisation of healthcare services by subgroups and analysis of non-response bias. DANCOS data are utilised in a variety of analyses presented here by a few examples that emphasise the impact of modifiable risk factors on public health  description of non-response bias  and the epidemiology of chronic pain and of osteoarthritis. Examples of DANCOS-based results are shown for each of the four topics. Smoking results in 24% of all deaths and  compared to other risk factors for public health  smoking accounts for the highest number of years of life lost. For non-response the mortality is higher among non-respondents than among respondents  but no significant bias on healthcare estimates can be seen. On average individuals with chronic pain had 12.8 contacts per year to the primary healthcare sector compared with 7.3 for individuals without. For osteoarthritis it is estimated that in 2020 there will be 22 600 incident cases. DANCOS is a public health survey linked with registers with many research possibilities. With this article we hope to stimulate further interest in the survey.
Reproductive Medicine,,,Socioeconomic differences in perinatal health and disease. The Danish Medical Birth Register has been used extensively in conjunction with other national registers to examine different aspects of socioeconomic differences in perinatal health outcomes. Here  we review some recent findings. Socioeconomic differences were observed in stillbirth  preterm birth  birthweight  congenital anomalies  and infant death. The patterns varied according to the health outcome and measure of socioeconomic position  but also according to the time period and the country under study. Our review also shows how many different strategies have been used to examine the influence of socioeconomic factors on perinatal health. Danish register data is an invaluable source of information on socioeconomic differences in perinatal health. Danish registers continue to provide excellent opportunities for research and surveillance in this area.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Insulin treatment in children]. Improving the diabetes metabolic regulation decreases the risk of microvascular diabetic complications. Insulin treatment in children therefore tends to be intensified to multiple-dose insulin (MDI) or continuous subcutaneous insulin injection (CSII). Further  insulin analogues are increasingly used. The pharmacokinetics of human and analogue insulin are summarised. It is concluded that pharmacokinetic studies on analogue insulin in children are required. Yet  no clear evidence of improved glycaemic control of the intensified treatment regimes has been shown in children. Long-term randomised studies are needed.
Cardiology,,,Association between endovascular performance in a simulated setting and in the catheterization laboratory. Simulation-based assessment studies have related simulator performance to clinical experience instead of actual clinical performance. This study validates a novel rating scale for coronary angiography (CA) performance and at the same time explores the association between CA performance in a simulated setting and in the catheterization laboratory. Ten cardiologists and cardiology residents with varying degrees of CA experience performed 2 CAs in the catheterization laboratory and 2 CAs in a simulated setting. The residents had prior simulator experience opposite cardiologists. Two raters assessed the operators' video-recorded performances using the novel CA rating scale (CARS). The correlation between CARS scores in the catheterization laboratory and the simulated setting was R = 0.20 (P = 0.195). Residents' scores were higher in the simulated setting than in the catheterization laboratory. The correlation between operators' previous clinical experience in CA and CARS scores was R = 0.65 (P = 0.005) in the catheterization laboratory and R = 0.11 (P = 0.353) in the simulated setting. The association between CA performance in a simulated setting and actual performance in the catheterization laboratory is not linear. The novel rating scale for CA (CARS) seems to be a valid proficiency assessment instrument in the catheterization laboratory. Familiarity with the simulator may overestimate proficiency  which means that simulator performance as a predictor of clinical performance should be interpreted with caution.
Radiology  Interventional,,,Simulation: moving from technology challenge to human factors success. Recognition of the many limitations of traditional apprenticeship training is driving new approaches to learning medical procedural skills. Among simulation technologies and methods available today  computer-based systems are topical and bring the benefits of automated  repeatable  and reliable performance assessments. Human factors research is central to simulator model development that is relevant to real-world imaging-guided interventional tasks and to the credentialing programs in which it would be used.
Radiology  Interventional,,,Use of performance curves in estimating number of procedures required to achieve proficiency in coronary angiography. Current guidelines in cardiology training programs recommend 100-300 coronary angiography procedures for certification. We aimed to assess the number of procedures needed to reach sufficient proficiency. Procedure time  fluoroscopy time  dose area product (DAP)  and contrast media volume were used as indicators of quality of performance. We analyzed data from 4 200 coronary angiographies. Performance curves of seven trainees were compared with recommended reference levels and to those of seven interventional cardiologists. On average  the number of procedures needed for trainees to reach recommended reference levels was estimated as 226 and 353  for DAP and use of contrast media  respectively. After 300 procedures  trainees' procedure time  fluoroscopy time  DAP  and contrast media volume were significantly higher compared with experts' performance  P < 0.001 for all parameters. To approach the experts' level of DAP and contrast media use  trainees need 394 and 588 procedures  respectively. Performance curves showed large individual differences in the development of competence. On average  trainees needed 300 procedures to reach sufficient level of proficiency  and this is in accordance with current guidelines. However  because of large individual differences  performance curves might be useful in monitoring individual trainees' progress and ensure documentation of sufficient competence when dealing with patients at risk.
Forensic Pathology,,,A fast preparation of skeletal materials using enzyme maceration. The current study investigates the removal of soft tissues from mice and rats by the use of three different proteases and one lipase from Novozymes A/S. The results demonstrate the enzyme maceration to be remarkably fast (1-3 h) compared to the traditional warm-water procedure  which requires up to several days. In addition  the enzyme maceration eliminates the odor problem associated with the traditional procedure. It is shown that stirring of the enzyme maceration bath is the main factor which determines the speed of the maceration. For mice  the time required for enzyme maceration can vary from 1 to 8 h depending on the stirring speed. The method investigated here allows preparation of skeletal material in an essentially odorless way within a matter of hours  making the method useful in particular for forensic science  private conservation workshops  and educational purposes.
Telemedicine,,,[Varying effect of telemedicine in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease--a systematic review]. A systematic review of existing evidence on the efficiency of telemedicine solutions for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was performed. A systematic literature search was conducted in five relevant databases followed by evaluation of methodology and results in selected studies. Nine RCT trials of varying quality were identified. The selected studies were mostly multimodal with telemedicine as part of a more complex intervention. Benefits of using telemedicine solutions for patients with COPD are not yet clear  but in some multimodal studies with telemedicine as part of the solution a positive effect on hospital admissions  emergency room visits and contacts to primary care may be seen. Larger studies are needed.
Evidence-Based Practice,,,Use of evidence based practices to improve survival without severe morbidity for very preterm infants: results from the EPICE population based cohort.  To evaluate the implementation of four high evidence practices for the care of very preterm infants to assess their use and impact in routine clinical practice and whether they constitute a driver for reducing mortality and neonatal morbidity.  Prospective multinational population based observational study.  19 regions from 11 European countries covering 850 000 annual births participating in the EPICE (Effective Perinatal Intensive Care in Europe for very preterm births) project.  7336 infants born between 24+0 and 31+6 weeks' gestation in 2011/12 without serious congenital anomalies and surviving to neonatal admission.  Combined use of four evidence based practices for infants born before 28 weeks' gestation using an "all or none" approach: delivery in a maternity unit with appropriate level of neonatal care; administration of antenatal corticosteroids; prevention of hypothermia (temperature on admission to neonatal unit ≥36°C); surfactant used within two hours of birth or early nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Infant outcomes were in-hospital mortality  severe neonatal morbidity at discharge  and a composite measure of death or severe morbidity  or both. We modelled associations using risk ratios  with propensity score weighting to account for potential confounding bias. Analyses were adjusted for clustering within delivery hospital.  Only 58.3% (n=4275) of infants received all evidence based practices for which they were eligible. Infants with low gestational age  growth restriction  low Apgar scores  and who were born on the day of maternal admission to hospital were less likely to receive evidence based care. After adjustment  evidence based care was associated with lower in-hospital mortality (risk ratio 0.72  95% confidence interval 0.60 to 0.87) and in-hospital mortality or severe morbidity  or both (0.82  0.73 to 0.92)  corresponding to an estimated 18% decrease in all deaths without an increase in severe morbidity if these interventions had been provided to all infants.  More comprehensive use of evidence based practices in perinatal medicine could result in considerable gains for very preterm infants  in terms of increased survival without severe morbidity.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Early vs delayed clamping of the umbilical cord in full term  preterm and very preterm infants]. Randomized studies from 2006 and two meta-analyses published in 2007 agree that clamping of the umbilical cord can be delayed. For the preterm and very preterm infant benefits include less need for blood transfusion and less morbidity  especially for the very preterm male infant. For the term infant benefits include improved hematologic status measured as hematocrit and iron status and less risk of anaemia during the first months of life. No harmful effects were seen  even though significant polycythaemia could be demonstrated.
Epidemiology,,,Atrial ectopy and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide as predictors of atrial fibrillation: a population-based cohort study. The risk of incident atrial fibrillation (AF) can be estimated by clinical parameters in the Framingham AF risk model. Elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and increased rate of premature atrial contractions (PACs) have been shown to be associated with AF  but the additive value of both of these biomarkers in the Framingham AF risk model has not been fully examined. A total of 646 subjects from the Copenhagen Holter Study (mean age 64.4 ± 6.8 years  41.6% women) with no history of prior AF  stroke or cardiovascular disease were followed for the diagnosis of incident AF or death (median follow-up time 14.4 years). Median NT-proBNP was 6.7 pmol/L (IQR: 3.6-13.5)  median PAC count was 1.4 beats/h (IQR: 0.6-4.5)  71 (11.0%) subjects developed AF  and 244 (37.8%) died. Multiple Cox regression including Framingham AF risk score  log-transformed NT-proBNP  and log-transformed PAC showed a significant increase in AF hazard risk [hazard ratio (HR) 1.45  95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14-1.85  P = 0.002; HR 1.23  95% CI 1.09-1.39  P = 0.001]. The addition of PAC to the Framingham AF risk model significantly improved the time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC 65.6 vs. 72.6; P = 0.008)  while the addition of NT-proBNP did not. Atrial fibrillation risk discrimination was significantly improved by the addition of PAC to the Framingham AF risk model  but not by the addition of NT-proBNP.
Epidemiology,,,Residential exposure to traffic noise and risk of incident atrial fibrillation: A cohort study. Studies have found long-term exposure to traffic noise to be associated with higher risk for hypertension  ischemic heart disease and stroke. We aimed to investigate the novel hypothesis that traffic noise increases the risk of atrial fibrillation (A-fib). In a population-based cohort of 57 053 people aged 50-64years at enrolment in 1993-1997  we identified 2692 cases of first-ever hospital admission of A-fib from enrolment to end of follow-up in 2011 using a nationwide registry. The mean follow-up time was 14.7years. Present and historical residential addresses were identified for all cohort members from 1987 to 2011. For all addresses  exposure to road traffic and railway noise was estimated using the Nordic prediction method and exposure to air pollution was estimated using a validated dispersion model. We used Cox proportional hazard model for the analyses with adjustment for lifestyle  socioeconomic position and air pollution. A 10dB higher 5-year time-weighted mean exposure to road traffic noise was associated with a 6% higher risk of A-fib (incidence rate ratio (IRR): 1.06; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.00-1.12) in models adjusted for factors related to lifestyle and socioeconomic position. The association followed a monotonic exposure-response relationship. In analyses with adjustment for air pollution  NOx or NO2  there were no statistically significant associations between exposure to road traffic noise and risk of A-fib; IRR: 1.04; (95% CI: 0.96-1.11) and IRR: 1.01; (95% CI: 0.94-1.09)  respectively. Exposure to railway noise was not associated with A-fib. Exposure to residential road traffic noise may be associated with higher risk of A-fib  though associations were difficult to separate from exposure to air pollution.
Epidemiology,,,The circadian variation of premature atrial contractions. The aim of the study was to assess a possible circadian variation of premature atrial contractions (PACs) in a community-based population and to determine if the daily variation could be used to assess a more vulnerable period of PACs in predicting later incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF). We studied 638 subjects between the ages of 55 and 75 years from the Copenhagen Holter Study who underwent up to 48 h electrocardiogram recording. Follow-up on cardiovascular endpoints was performed in 2013 with a median follow-up time of 14.4 years. According to previous studies  two subgroups were studied based on a cut-off point of ≥720 PACs/day termed frequent PACs (n = 66) and not frequent PACs with <720 PACs/day (n = 572). Based on median values  a circadian rhythm could not be demonstrated in the population as a whole and the group without frequent PACs. However  a circadian variation was observed in the group with frequent PACs  who had the fewest PACs/h during the night with a nadir at 6 am and then reaching a peak value in the afternoon at 3 pm. Runs of PACs in all subjects showed a similar circadian variation. Both PACs/h and runs of PACs seemed to follow the daily variation in heart rate. After adjusting for relevant risk factors  the risk of AF was equal in all time intervals throughout the day. Premature atrial contractions showed a circadian variation in subjects with frequent PACs. No specific time interval of the day was more predictive of AF than others.
Oncology Nursing,,,Socially disadvantaged parents of children treated with allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT): report from a supportive intervention study  Denmark. This study was undertaken to test a daily Family Navigator Nurse (FNN) conducted intervention program  to support parents during the distressful experience of their child's Allogeneic Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT). A qualitative analysis of the supportive intervention program for parents whose child is under HSCT treatment while hospitalized. Parents to 25 children were included in the intervention group. Twenty-five parents were included in a participant observational study and 21 of these completed a semi-structured interview 100 days following HSCT. Three main problems faced by all parents included 1) the emotional strain of the child's HSCT; 2) re-organizing of the family's daily life to include hospitalization with the child; and 3) the financial strain of manoeuvring within the Danish welfare system. The FNN performed daily intervention rounds to ease each of these problems during the study period. Having the following pre-existing risk factors  negatively influenced the parents' ability to address these problems: 1) being a single parents; 2) low-level income; 3) low-level education; 4) low-level network support: 5) being a student or unemployed; 6) physical/psychiatric illness; and 7) ethnicity. Six families with 4 or more risk factors had complex emotional  social and financial problems that required extensive intervention by the FNN and that impacted their ability to provide care for the child. The parents' pre-existing risk factors were further complicated by their children's HSCT. A recommendation for clinical practice is to identify families with multiple interrelated problems and allocate resources to support these families.
Nursing Methodology Research,,,An analysis of parental roles during haematopoietic stem cell transplantation of their offspring: a qualitative and participant observational study. The aim of this study was to investigate the parents' experiences and reflections on their parental role while taking care of their child. Parents of children undergoing treatment with allogeneic haematopoetic stem cell transplantation for life threatening diseases in protective isolation  experience distress related to the child's care. Parents struggle to cope with the stress related to the child's disease  treatment and survival possibilities. During the period 2007-2009  eight participant studies and 16 in-depth interviews were performed and analysed using a theoretical ideal type construction and an interactionistic approach. Three ideal types of approaches were identified (1) expertise-mindedness  (2) dialogue-mindedness and (3) the approach of the socially challenged parents. Expertise-minded parents base their rationality for care and interactions on medical knowledge. It is important for dialogue-minded parents that emotions are included in the rationality for care. Being able to manage these two approaches requires emotional work in the form of both surface- and deep acting from the parents. Socially challenged parents fail to adapt to either of the two approaches since they often fail to manage the required emotional work. The three described ideal types give a new perspective on the complex interactions that occur between parents  child and staff during treatment with haematopoetic stem cell transplantation. Understanding the rationality behind the different approaches adopted by parents may assist medical staff to understand the parents' rationality for care of their child and to identify socially challenged parents who need help in managing the care of their child.
Psychiatry,,,The search for neuroimaging and cognitive endophenotypes: A critical systematic review of studies involving unaffected first-degree relatives of individuals with bipolar disorder. The phenomenology and underlying pathophysiology of bipolar disorder (BD) are heterogeneous. The identification of putative endophenotypes for BD can aid in the investigation of unique patho-etiological pathways  which may lead to the development of personalised preventative and therapeutic approaches for this multi-faceted disorder. We included original studies involving unaffected first-degree relatives of BD patients (URs) and a healthy control (HC) comparison group with no first-degree family history of mental disorders  investigating: 'cold' and 'hot' cognition and functional and structural neuroimaging. Seventy-seven cross-sectional studies met the inclusion criteria. The present review revealed that URs in comparison with HCs showed: (i) widespread deficits in verbal memory  sustained attention  and executive function; (ii) abnormalities in the reactivity to and regulation of emotional information along with aberrant reward processing  and heightened attentional interference by emotional stimuli; and (iii) less consistency in the findings regarding structural and resting state neuroimaging  and electrophysiological measures.
Precision Medicine,Psychiatry,,Personalized medicine in psychiatry. Personalized medicine is a model in which a patient's unique clinical  genetic  and environmental characteristics are the basis for treatment and prevention. Aim  method  and results: This review aims to describe the current tools  phenomenological features  clinical risk factors  and biomarkers used to provide personalized medicine. Furthermore  this study describes the target areas in which they can be applied including diagnostics  treatment selection and response  assessment of risk of side-effects  and prevention. Personalized medicine in psychiatry is challenged by the current taxonomy  where the diagnostic categories are broad and great biological heterogeneity exists within each category. There is  thus  a gap between the current advanced research prospects and clinical practice  and the current taxonomy is  thus  a poor basis for biological research. The discussion proposes possible solutions to narrow this gap and to move psychiatric research forward towards personalized medicine.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Do inattention and hyperactivity symptoms equal scholastic impairment? Evidence from three European cohorts. Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) affects many children  adolescents  and adults and is associated with a number of impairments. Poor academic performance is related to ADHD in clinical samples. However  it is unclear to what extent core ADHD symptoms and scholastic impairment are related in non-referred school-aged children. Data come from three population-based cohorts from Sweden  Denmark  and Finland  which are part of the Nordic Network on ADHD. The combined sample size was 13 087 children who were studied at ages 7-8 or 10-12 years. Teachers rated children on inattention and hyperactivity symptoms and reported children's scholastic performance on basic skills. There was a significant association in all cohorts between core ADHD symptoms and scholastic impairment in reading  writing  and mathematics. Particularly  inattention was related to a two to tenfold increase in scholastic impairment. Prevalence of hyperactivity symptoms was similar across the three cohorts  but inattention was lowest among children from the Finnish cohort  after stratification on living conditions. These results extend previous reports of scholastic impairment among children with clinically diagnosed ADHD to non-referred population samples from three European countries. Surveillance policies should be implemented in school systems to catch children in need of behavioral or scholastic support early.
Family Practice,,,[Are systematic consultation invitations and spirometry in general practice useful in the prevention of COPD among smokers?]. There is a need for valid tools to help people stop smoking. The aim of this study was to investigate whether or not systematic invitation of patients for a consultation and spirometry and the subsequent follow-up including the identified COPD patients in general practice is expedient in prevention of COPD among smokers. The entire population of 40-50-year-old patients listed with ten general practitioners in Southern Jutland received a questionnaire and a letter in which smokers were invited to attend a consultation with their GP to have their lung function measured. Patients diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were offered renewed testing and guidance to quit smoking. A total of 2299 questionnaires were sent out  299 smokers responded (11.3% of the total number of patients)  and 185 of the respondents (71.4%) attended an initial consultation. Twelve patients were diagnosed with COPD and thus met the criteria for invitation to renewed testing  but only five accepted the invitation. None of the patients who accepted renewed testing changed their smoking habits. Systematic invitations for consultation and spirometry in general practice as COPD prevention has proven to be difficult. Various models should be assessed before large scale interventions are implemented.
Emergency Medicine,General Surgery,Gynecology,Burnout among middle-grade doctors of tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia. Burnout Syndrome is a mental condition caused by chronic exposure to work related stress and is identified by the presence of any of the three distinct elements of emotional exhaustion  depersonalization and lack of personal accomplishment. Middle grade doctors are the backbone of any tertiary care hospital / medical institution  partaking in unscheduled and inpatient care. The aim of this study was to assess the presence of burnout syndrome in the middle grade doctors in a tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia. The study was conducted at the Armed Forces Hospital Southern Region  Khamis Mushyt  from August to October 2012 in departments with at least fifty inpatient admissions per month and with at least five middle grade (Resident  Registrar and Senior Registrar) doctors. The departments were Obstetrics and Gynecology  Internal Medicine  Pediatrics  Emergency  General Surgery and Nephrology. This was a cross sectional descriptive and analytical study using the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Health Services Survey and a self-reported stressor-identifying questionnaire to ascertain possible precursors of  or contributing factors to  Burnout Syndrome. A total of 96 proformas/questionnaires were collected anonymously to maintain confidentiality and burnout syndrome was identified in as high as 88.5% of the respondents with high emotional exhaustion in 68.8%  high depersonalization in 63.6% and low personal accomplishment in 38.5%. The authors concluded that burnout syndrome is high among the middle-grade doctors in this medical facility and that urgent steps are needed to address this problem to ensure that these physicians remain physically and mentally healthy.
Nursing,,,Nursing in fast-track total hip and knee arthroplasty: A retrospective study. To describe the increased activity in total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) from 2002 to 2012 in a single orthopaedic department  the organisation of fast-track and its consequences for nursing care. Retrospective  descriptive design. Data collection; from the hospital administrative database  local descriptions of fast-track  personal contact and discussion with staff. The number of operations increased threefold from 351 operations in 2002 to 1024 operations in 2012. In 2012  THA/TKA patients had a postoperative mean LOS of 2.6/2.8 days. Nurses had gained tasks from surgeons and physiotherapists and thus gained more responsibility  for example  for pain management and mobilisation. Staffing levels in the ward in 2002 and 2012 were almost unchanged; 16.0 and 15.8 respectively. Nurses were undertaking more complicated tasks. Nursing care must still focus on the individual patient. Nurses need to have enough education to manage the complex tasks and increased responsibility. To prevent undesirable outcomes in the future  there is a need to pay attention to the nursing quality in balance with the nursing budget. It may  therefore  be considered a worthwhile investment to employ expert/highly qualified professional nurses in fast-track THA and TKA units.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Documented effect of extra corporeal photopheresis on T-cell mediated diseases]. During extra corporeal photopheresis (ECP) 1.500 ml blood is extracted. Leucocytes are separated by centrifugation. Methoxsalen is added to the leucocytes and activated by UVA light. After treatment leucocytes are returned to the patient. ECP is a part of the treatment of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in bone marrow transplant patients and severe cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTLC). Studies have documented an effect of ECP in GVHD and CTLC. ECP has been used to treat other T-cell mediated diseases  the documentation however is sparse. The side effects of ECP are few and not serious.
Stroke Rehabilitation,,,Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy resulting in stroke in an 11-year-old male. Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is caused by mutations in the Notch3 gene on chromosome 19. The condition manifests itself clinically typically in the third to fifth decade with migraine and recurrent episodes of stroke or transient ischaemic attacks. We report the case of an 11-year-old male with CADASIL resulting in stroke with right hemiparesis and dysphasia. Acute magnetic resonance imaging suggested infarction in the left hemisphere; magnetic resonance angiography revealed calibre variation of the intracerebral arteries. The patient suffered from common migraine with five to six attacks per month for 3 years 6 months before the stroke. Attacks occurred early in the morning with severe one-sided headache  photophobia  nausea  and vomiting. Antimigraine medications had no effect. The family history revealed more cases of CADASIL  with an autosomal dominant pattern. The diagnosis of CADASIL was confirmed by the finding of the known mutation of the Notch3 gene running in the family. With treatment in a neurorehabilitation centre the patient recovered most of his functions with only discrete fine-motor and cognitive sequelae. Our case report highlights the need for paediatricians to consider CADASIL in childhood stroke as well as in migraine patients.
Psychiatric Nursing,Nursing,Psychiatry,Comparing the effect of non-medical mechanical restraint preventive factors between psychiatric units in Denmark and Norway. The use of mechanical restraint (MR) is controversial  and large differences regarding the use of MR are often found among countries. In an earlier study  we observed that MR was used twice as frequently in Denmark than Norway. To examine how presumed MR preventive factors of non-medical origin may explain the differing number of MR episodes between Denmark and Norway. This study is a cross-sectional survey of psychiatric units. Linear regression was used to assess the confounding effects of the MR preventive factors  i.e. whether a difference in the impact of these factors is evident between Denmark and Norway. Six MR preventive factors confounded [∆exp(B)> 10%] the difference in MR use between Denmark and Norway  including staff education (- 51%)  substitute staff (- 17%)  acceptable work environment (- 15%)  separation of acutely disturbed patients (13%)  patient-staff ratio (- 11%)  and the identification of the patient's crisis triggers (- 10%). These six MR preventive factors might partially explain the difference in the frequency of MR episodes observed in the two countries  i.e. higher numbers in Denmark than Norway. One MR preventive factor was not supported by earlier research  the identification of the patient's crisis triggers; therefore  more research on the mechanisms involved is needed. None of the six MR preventive factors presents any adverse effects; therefore  units in Denmark and Norway may consider investigating the effect of implementing  the identification of the patient's crisis triggers  an increased number of staff per patient  increased staff education  a better work environment and reduced use of substitute staff in practice.
Psychiatric Nursing,,,Mechanical restraint in psychiatry: preventive factors in theory and practice. A Danish-Norwegian association study. To examine how potential mechanical restraint preventive factors in hospitals are associated with the frequency of mechanical restraint episodes. This study employed a retrospective association design  and linear regression was used to assess the associations. Three mechanical restraint preventive factors were significantly associated with low rates of mechanical restraint use: mandatory review (exp[B] = .36  p < .01)  patient involvement (exp[B] = .42  p < .01)  and no crowding (exp[B] = .54  p < .01). None of the three mechanical restraint preventive factors presented any adverse effects; therefore  units should seriously consider implementing these measures.
Psychiatry,,,Coercion within Danish psychiatry compared with 10 other European countries. In 2008  the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) criticized the use of mechanical restraint in Denmark and referred to it as ill-treatment. What do other European countries do better? To answer this question  we compared the use of coercive measures regarding psychiatric inpatients in Denmark and comparable European countries. Comparing coercive measures from Denmark  Sweden  Norway  Finland  Iceland  Belgium  The Netherlands  United Kingdom  Ireland  France and Italy. Review of international literature and a cross-sectional study performed as a questionnaire survey. Denmark used more mechanical restraint and holding than Finland and Norway; however Sweden used twice as much as Denmark. Finland used more seclusion than did the other countries. Norway was the country that used the smallest amount of physical coercion. Only Norway  Finland  Sweden and Denmark had comparable representative data on coercion. Norway used less physical restraint than Denmark. We could not find any obvious reasons for the differences in the use of physical restraint. Comparing the factors surrounding coercion between countries may serve as a basis for minimizing coercion and carrying it out in the most acceptable manner for the patients  thereby providing better psychiatric treatment in Europe.
Ecotoxicology,,,Polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine pesticides in River Brahmaputra from the outer Himalayan Range and River Hooghly emptying into the Bay of Bengal: Occurrence  sources and ecotoxicological risk assessment. River Brahmaputra (RB) from the outer Himalayan Range and River Hooghly (RH)  a distributary of River Ganga  are the two largest transboundary perennial rivers supplying freshwater to the northeastern and eastern states of India. Given the history of extensive usage of organochlorine pesticides and increasing industrialization along the banks of these rivers we investigated selected organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the surface water of River Brahmaputra and River Hooghly. Geomean of ΣOCPs (53 ng L(-1)) and Σ19PCBs (108 ng L(-1)) was higher in RH compared with geomean of ΣOCPs (24 ng L(-1)) and Σ19PCBs (77 ng L(-1)) in RB. Among OCPs  γ-HCH showed maximum detection frequency in both the rivers reflecting ongoing lindane usage. DDT and endosulfan residues were observed at specific locations where past or ongoing sources exist. Elevated concentrations of heavier congeners (penta-hepta) were observed in those sites along RH where port and industrial activities were prevalent including informal electronic waste scrap processing units. Furthermore along River Hooghly PCB-126 was high in the suburban industrial belt of Howrah district. PCBs were found to be ubiquitously distributed in RB. Atmospheric transport of tri- and tetra-PCB congeners from the primary source regions might be a major contributor for PCBs in RB. Heavier congeners (penta-nona) in the urban centers of RB were likely due to industrial wastewater runoff from the oil refineries in the Brahmaputra valley. Σ19PCBs concentrations in this study exceeded the USEPA recommended limit for freshwater. Ecotoxicological risk assessment showed the possibility of adverse impact on the organisms in the lower trophic level due to DDT and lindane contamination. Impact of endosulfan on fishes might be of considerable concern for aquatic environment.
Anesthesiology,Family Practice,,[Advanced prehospital care in patients with life-threatening conditions--survival rate  health status and functional level]. In Aarhus  Denmark  advanced prehospital care was carried out by anaesthetists working in a rendezvous model with ordinary ambulances. The effect on the patient was evaluated by the physician on scene. The purpose of the study was to evaluate survival rate  health status and functional level in patients after lifesaving prehospital care. Consecutive data were reported to a prehospital database and the National Patient Registry. Data on survival from 1998 to 2000 were retrieved. Functional level was studied in lifesaving cases in the year 2000. We interviewed the general practitioners (GPs) involved according to EuroQol. The EuroQol interview concerned health status and function level. In 1998-2000  prehospital anaesthetists attended a total of 11 684 patients. Treatment was described as lifesaving in 238 (2%) of the cases  and 63% of the patients (151/238) were alive one year later. In the year 2000  79 patients were identified as having had lifesaving treatment  and 48 were alive one year later; 67% (32/48) were without functional impairment according to EuroQol. The most frequent diagnoses were self-intoxication and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Lifesaving prehospital care  as evaluated by the prehospital physician on scene  was performed in 2 percent of all cases attended by a prehospital anaesthetist. Of these patients  the majority were alive after one year and without functional impairment  according to their GP. The diagnoses were varied.
Rehabilitation,,,Harmonization of Databases: A Step for Advancing the Knowledge About Spinal Cord Injury. The objectives of this article are to (1) provide an overview of existing spinal cord injury (SCI) clinical research databases-their purposes  characteristics  and accessibility to users; and (2) present a vision for future collaborations required for cross-cutting research in SCI. This vision highlights the need for validated and relevant data for longitudinal clinical trials and observational and epidemiologic SCI-related studies. Three existing SCI clinical research databases/registries are reviewed and summarized with regard to current formats  collection methods  and uses  including major strengths and weaknesses. Efforts to provide a uniform approach to data collection are also reviewed. The databases reviewed offer different approaches to capture important clinical information on SCI. They vary on size  purpose  data points  inclusion of standard outcomes  and technical requirements. Each presents with a set of limitations including lack of population data and lack of a common platform for data comparisons and exchanges. It is clear that numerous issues need to be considered when planning to establish common ways of collecting data through data sets or patient registries  ranging from a carefully crafted implementation plan that lists purposes  cost  resources required  and policies to guide such development to establishing a framework for dissemination of data and findings. For the present  taking advantage of the vast but different data already collected over many decades may require a variety of statistical skills and epidemiologic techniques. Ultimately  our ability to speak the same language with regard to variables and assessment tools will facilitate international collaborations and enhance comparability  data pooling  and the ability to generalize findings to a broader population.
Rehabilitation,,,Determining the most robust dimensional structure of categories from the international classification of functioning  disability and health across subgroups of persons with spinal cord injury to build the basis for future clinical measures. To determine the most robust dimensional structure of the International Classification of Functioning  Disability and Health (ICF) categories relevant to spinal cord injury (SCI) across subgroups of lesion level  health care context  sex  age  and resources of the country. A multidimensional between-item response Rasch model was used. The choice of the dimensions was conceptually driven using the ICF components from the functioning chapters and splits of the activity and participation component described in the ICF. Secondary analysis of data from an international  cross-sectional  multicentric study for the Development of ICF Core Sets for Spinal Cord Injury. Persons with SCI (N=1048) from the early postacute and long-term living context from 14 middle/low- and high-resource countries. Not applicable. Ratings of categories of the ICF relevant for SCI were analyzed. Five models were tested on the complete sample and 5 subgroups. The overall reliability of all models and reliability within dimensions of the unidimensional and 2-dimensional models were good to excellent. The ICF categories spread well along the disability scale. The model fit improvement from the unidimensional to the 2-dimensional and from the 2-dimensional to the 3-dimensional model was significant in all groups (P<.0001). The improvement  however  from a unidimensional to a 2-dimensional structure was markedly better than from a 2-dimensional to a 3-dimensional one. We propose that a 2-dimensional structure separating body functions and body structures from the activity and participation categories should serve as a basis for developing clinical measures in SCI in the future.
Rehabilitation,,,Towards the development of clinical measures for spinal cord injury based on the International Classification of Functioning  Disability and Health with Rasch analyses. To determine whether the International Classification of Functioning  Disability and Health (ICF) categories relevant to spinal cord injury (SCI) can be integrated in clinical measures and to obtain insights to guide their future operationalization. Specific aims are to find out whether the ICF categories relevant to SCI fit a Rasch model taking into consideration the dimensionality found in previous investigations  local item dependencies  or differential item functioning. All second-level ICF categories collected in the Development of ICF Core Sets for SCI project in specialized centers within 15 countries from 2006 through 2008. Secondary data analysis. Adults (N=1048) with SCI from the early postacute and long-term living context. Not applicable. Two unidimensional Rasch analyses: one for the ICF categories from body functions and body structures components and another for the ICF categories from the activities and participation component. Results support good reliability and targeting of the ICF categories in both dimensions. In each dimension  few ICF categories were subject to misfit. Local item dependency was observed between ICF categories of the same chapters. Group effects for age and sex were observed only to a small extent. The validity of ICF categories to develop measures of functioning in SCI for clinical practice and research is to some extent supported. Model adjustments were suggested to further improve their operationalization and psychometrics.
Family Practice,,,[Views of GPs and patients on use of computers during consultation]. The aim of this study was to describe how Danish patients and their general practitioners (GPs) perceive physician's use of computers during consultation. Data were collected between November 2006 and February 2007 at five primary care clinics. Nine GPs and 253 of their patients completed complementary questionnaires concerning the consultation as a whole and their perceptions of computer use during consultation. Patients were generally satisfied with their GP's use of computers during consultations. Compared to their practitioners  patients more often perceived computer use to be extensive. 28% of patients reported their GP's computer use as extensive. These patients more often reported discomfort with their GP's computer use (OR 1.09)  or stated that they did not get help with the problem they most wanted solved (OR 0.83)  compared with patients who perceived their GP's computer use as less extensive. Men (OR 2.21) and patients over 55 years of age (OR 2.45) were also overrepresented in this group. Overall  patients were satisfied with their consultations. Patients generally perceived computer use as more extensive than doctors did. Where patients perceived their GP's computer use as extensive  they tended to rate selected consultation quality indicators lower. Further study in this field of general practice is therefore needed.
Pathology  Clinical,Telepathology,,[Past  present and future of digital pathology]. The four main aspects of applied medical information technology  which change the traditional systems of the entire health service are signal and data processing  digital modelling and interface optimisation. The information technology serving individual clinical specialties including clinical histopathology is changing at each of the four levels resulting in transformation of the communication paradigms. The object of investigation in histopathology is the digital slide  which is accessible throughout the world with no time or geographical limits. It permits the digital modelling of routine histological and/or cytological slide and it also allows measurements by using image analysis or stereology software packages. The electronic slide can be viewed  examined and diagnosed on a computer connected to a microscope  a new interface in diagnostic histopathology. This study describes the main theoretical and practical aspects  including challenges  of digital pathology and it also discusses the conditions required for successful information management. It reviews the experiences of the last one and half decades gained in the field of pathological information technology in Hungary including its main episodes and milestones of development. Introducing its present state  this paper describes the concept and the mode of investigation of the digital slide. It shows the development and use of a virtual microscope in Hungary. Based on know-how including the British experience this review describes the possible uses of digital slides  which by improving communication could have a positive effect on the entire health care system. It summarises the possible and necessary components of a digital pathology laboratory  which may include the new Slide Archive and Communication System (SACS). Using experimental data it mentions the possibility of generating primary digital pathological sample and producing the so called optical biopsy with no need for removing tissue from the patient.
Telepathology,,,The image pyramid system--an unbiased  inexpensive and broadly accessible method of telepathology. Although computerised information technology  including the Internet is broadly used and globally accessible it is still not a significant form of professional communications in diagnostic histopathology. The high cost of interactive dynamic telepathology systems makes their use limited outside the richest economies. In contrast static telepathology systems are relatively cheap but in practice their information content can be heavily biased by the choice of images sent by the consulting pathologist. The degree of this bias may be regarded simply as the amount of information transferred to a remote location expressed as a percentage of the total information present in the histological sample. We refer to this as the percentage of explicit versus implicit information. Another major source of bias may be found in the information transmitted in written or verbal discussion with a remote consultant. We have developed a system of static telepathology  the image pyramid  which attempts to minimise bias by transferring all of the information in a section to the consultant. It is inexpensive and should prove to be widely accessible.
Forensic Pathology,,,Interobserver agreement of the injury diagnoses obtained by postmortem computed tomography of traffic fatality victims and a comparison with autopsy results. The present study investigated the interobserver variation between a radiologist and a forensic pathologist in 994 injury diagnoses obtained by postmortem computed tomography (CT) of 67 traffic fatality victims  and the results were compared with diagnoses obtained by autopsy. The injuries were coded according to the abbreviated injury scale (AIS). We found a low interobserver variability for postmortem CT injury diagnoses  and the variability was the lowest for injuries with a high AIS severity score. The radiologist diagnosed more injuries than the pathologist  especially in the skeletal system  but the pathologist diagnosed more organ injuries. We recommend the use of a radiologist as a consultant for the evaluation of postmortem CT images. Training in radiology should be included in forensic medicine postgraduate training. CT was superior to autopsy in detecting abnormal air accumulations  but autopsy was superior to CT in the detection of organ injuries and aortic ruptures. We recommend a combination of CT and autopsy for the postmortem investigation of traffic fatality victims.
Forensic Medicine,,,Abbreviated injury scale scoring in traffic fatalities: comparison of computerized tomography and autopsy. The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate the value of postmortem computerized tomography (CT) for Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) scoring and Injury Severity Scoring (ISS) of traffic fatalities. This is a prospective investigation of a consecutive series of 52 traffic fatalities from Southern Denmark that were CT scanned and autopsied. The AIS and ISS scores based on CT and autopsy (AU) were registered in a computer database and compared. Kappa values for reproducibility of AIS-severity scores and ISS scores were calculated. On an average  there was a 94% agreement between AU and CT in detecting the presence or absence of lesions in the various anatomic regions  and the severity scores were the same in 90% of all cases (range  75-100%). When different severity scoring was obtained  CT detected more lesions with a high severity score in the facial skeleton  pelvis  and extremities  whereas AU detected more lesions with high scores in the soft tissues (especially in the aorta)  cranium  and ribs. The kappa value for reproducibility of AIS scores confirmed that the agreement between the two methods was good. The lowest kappa values (>0.6) were found for the facial skeleton  cerebellum  meninges  neck organs  lungs  kidneys  and gastrointestinal tract. In these areas  the kappa value provided moderate agreement between CT and AU. For all other areas  there was a substantial agreement between the two methods. The ISS scores obtained by CT and by AU were calculated and were found to be with no or moderate variation in 85%. Rupture of the aorta was often overlooked by CT  resulting in too low ISS scoring. The most precise postmortem AIS and ISS scorings of traffic fatalities was obtained by a combination of AU and CT. If it is not possible to perform an AU  then CT may be used as an acceptable alternative for AIS scoring. We have identified one important obstacle for postmortem ISS scoring  namely that aorta ruptures are not easily detected by post mortem CT.
Forensic Dentistry,Forensic Pathology,,Computerized tomography used as a routine procedure at postmortem investigations. This is a prospective investigation of a consecutive series of 250 deceased individuals who were computerized tomography (CT)-scanned and autopsied. In 13% of patients  important findings at the CT-scanning were not found at the autopsy  and in 48% of patients  important autopsy findings were not found at the CT-scanning. The cause of death could be established by CT in 31%  by autopsy in 74%  and by toxicology in 22%. CT combined with data from the inquest could establish the cause of death in a majority of deaths due to severe trauma  but only in a minority of deaths caused by disease or poisoning. We found the Siemens Somatom Spirit dual-slice CT-scanner cost effective  quick  and well suited as a supplement to the routine autopsy. CT is useful in identifications  gunshot lesions  and traffic accidents. CT allows investigation of anatomic regions that are not easily available by autopsy and allows fractures and inner organs to be seen "in situ." CT provides documentation in digital form - easily stored - permits review by others and provides pictures that may be more suitable for presentation in court than autopsy photos.
Forensic Medicine,,,Intimate partner homicide. Intimate partner homicides represent the most severe outcome of intimate partner violence  and constitute more than a quarter (26%) of all homicides in adults over 15 years of age in Southern Denmark. In our experience the victims of partner homicides are primarily women  often from socially disadvantaged families  and that these homicides usually are the result of an impulsive act  with the perpetrator often committing suicide after the act. The aim of this study was to investigate these hypotheses further  and to provide an up-to-date overview of intimate partner homicides in Southern Denmark.
Forensic Pathology,,,[Computerized tomography in forensic autopsies]. Computerized tomography (CT) is finding increased use in forensic medicine. In this article we present our experience with CT in medico legal deaths. This is a retrospective investigation of 150 deceased individuals who were CT-scanned and autopsied. The CT-scanning was performed and interpreted by a specialist in forensic medicine. The CT-scanning and the autopsy were performed independently by two different physicians. In 9% of the cases  important findings by the CT-scanning were overlooked at the autopsy  and in 51% important findings by the autopsy were not found by the CT-scanning. The cause of death could be established by CT-scanning in 30%  by autopsy in 72% and by toxicology in 21% of the cases. CT-scanning was most useful in cases of traumatic death. CT is rarely a substitute for autopsy  but may contribute with important new information in many cases such as identifications (including mass-disasters)  gunshot wounds and traffic accidents. CT provides documentation in digital form that is easily stored and copied  permits review by others and provides pictures that may be more suitable for presentation in court than autopsy photos. CT may be helpful in medico legal external examinations (inquests) in the process of selecting cases for autopsy.
Forensic Medicine,,,[Children as victims of homicide 1972-2005]. Child homicides are rare but serious crimes. In this study the homicide rate and the development in the crime pattern will be investigated. The investigation is retrospective and comprises the 34 years during which the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Odense has existed. During this period 41 children under the age of 15 were killed in 30 episodes. The most frequent method of homicide was manual strangulation  and the second most frequent was blunt violence. It is demonstrated that the incidence of child homicide has decreased considerably compared to a previous investigation comprising all of Denmark. By far the largest decrease is in homicides committed by women against their own children  which have often been followed by suicide (family homicides). The decrease in family homicides committed by men is much less. Today men commit family homicides 8 times as frequently as women in the area under investigation. A possible explanation for the decreasing number of homicides committed by women against their own children is the decreased use of gas for cooking  whereby a frequent homicide method disappeared  and by improved socio-economic life conditions and gender balance. Men are now responsible for the majority of family homicides. Preventative measures for men in socially traumatic situations such as a divorce are recommended.
Forensic Pathology,,,[Fatal pulmonary thromoembolism]. Fatal pulmonary thromboembolism is a relatively common autopsy finding. The aim of this investigation is to describe the magnitude of the problem in an autopsy material and factors of prophylactic importance and to discuss the importance of the autopsy. Deceased with lethal pulmonary thromboembolism diagnosed by forensic autopsy at the Department of Forensic Medicine at the University of Southern Denmark in 1992-2005  in total 58 individuals. Data were collected from autopsy- plus police reports and medical records. Descriptive case-only investigation. The pulmonary embolism had in none of the cases been diagnosed before death. Two of the individuals in this investigation were healthy young females who used oral contraceptives  and one was a psychiatric patient who died from pulmonary embolism after five days of physical restraint. The diagnosis is sometimes not made before the autopsy. The decreasing autopsy frequency may result in a lack of diagnosis of pulmonary embolism as cause of death.
Forensic Pathology,,,Ethylene glycol poisoning. Ethylene glycol (EG) can be found in many agents  such as antifreeze. Ingestion of EG may cause serious poisoning. Adults are typically exposed when EG is ingested as a cheap substitute for ethanol or in suicide-attempts. Children may be exposed by accidental ingestion caused by decantation of EG to unlabeled bottles. EG has in itself a low toxicity  but is in vivo broken down to four organic acids: glycoaldehyde  glycolic acid  glyoxylic acid and oxalic acid. The metabolites are cell toxins that cause central nervous system depression  and cardio-pulmonary and renal failure. Glycolic acid causes severe acidosis  and oxalate is precipitated as calcium oxalate in the kidneys and other tissues. We present five case reports of fatal EG-poisoning  and review the literature concerning clinical presentation and diagnosis  pathological findings  treatment and prevention.
Forensic Medicine,,,Forensic medical examination of refugees who claim to have been tortured. The United Nations Convention against torture prohibits repatriation of refugees if there is reason to believe they will be tortured on return to their country. A history of torture is therefore an important factor in making a case for asylum. In this study  the results of the medical examinations of 59 torture victims investigated at the Department of Forensic Medicine  University of Aarhus  Denmark  1996-2002  are presented and discussed. Variables including age  sex  education  health  torture methods  condition of confinement  torture aftereffects  and findings at the forensic examination were registered in a database (Paradox) and analyzed. In 70%  aftereffects of torture could be documented. These included scars after fixation  burns  incisions  or flogging. Symptoms and signs from joints  muscles  and nerves were common in victims who had been suspended. Many of the victims of phalanga had painful feet and signs of walking impairment. A majority of the victims suffered from posttraumatic stress syndrome. An independent medical report offers an opportunity to evaluate and elaborate the story told by the victim and should be used in disputed cases. We have a duty to protect refugees against torture.
Forensic Nursing,,,DNA testing of sexual assault evidence: the laboratory perspective. The availability of DNA testing has dramatically changed the way that crimes are investigated. DNA results can link offenders to their crimes  exonerate wrongfully accused individuals  identify mass fatality victims and more. In the case of sexual assault  DNA evidence alone cannot prove that a sexual assault has occurred. DNA analysis can only reveal whether a person's DNA is  or is not  present. In this paper  the authors provide readers with an overview of the advantages and limitations of DNA analysis  the importance of proper evidence collection  the technologies available  and the amount of sample needed for testing. Through proper evidence collection and quality laboratory services  the full value of DNA will be realized.
Cardiac Rehabilitation,,,Measuring behavioral outcomes in cardiopulmonary rehabilitation: AN AACVPR STATEMENT. Outcome measurement in cardiopulmonary rehabilitation is required for optimal assessment of program quality  effectiveness of treatments  and evaluation of patient progress. Recent position statements from the American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation (AACVPR)  American College of Cardiology  American Heart Association  American Thoracic Society  and American College of Chest Physicians have provided state-of-the-art information on the importance of assessing performance and outcome measures for optimal program effectiveness. Such measures are also required for AACVPR program certification. To meet current standards of practice  the AACVPR developed an Outcomes Matrix that includes 4 domains: Health  Clinical  Behavioral  and Service. Although the Clinical and Health domains have been most commonly used in outcome reporting (eg  6-minute walk test  quality-of-life survey scores)  behavioral measures have received less attention  primarily because they have been perceived as being more difficult to measure and quantify over time. This statement describes 5 common behavioral outcome measures: smoking cessation  medication use  supplemental oxygen use  exercise habits  and nutritional behaviors. Sample questions and calculations for each of these behavioral measures are also provided. By using these measures at program entry and completion  cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation practitioners can effectively track and document behavioral changes over time for physicians  third-party insurance providers  or hospital administrators and thus demonstrate the effectiveness of exercise and educational interventions on patient overall health and well-being.
Anesthesiology,,,Transthoracic echocardiography in the perioperative setting. A need for further assessment of patients in the perioperative setting and an increasing availability of ultrasonography equipment have facilitated the diffusion of ultrasonography and lately focused transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in anesthesiology practice. This review will discuss the possible use of focused TTE in the perioperative setting and provides an update on present and future perspectives. Several studies focusing on patient management and diagnostic accuracy of perioperative  focused TTE  have been published recently. Several multidisciplinary guidelines addressing use and educational aspects of focused ultrasonography are available  yet guidelines focusing solely on the use in the perioperative setting are lacking. Hemodynamically significant cardiac disease or pathophysiology can be disclosed using TTE. Focused TTE is feasible for perioperative patient management and monitoring and will be an inevitable and indispensable tool for the anesthetist. Future research should focus on the outcome of perioperative TTE performed by anesthetists  using rigorous study designs and patient-centered outcomes such as mortality and morbidity.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,International evidence-based recommendations for focused cardiac ultrasound. Focused cardiac ultrasound (FoCUS) is a simplified  clinician-performed application of echocardiography that is rapidly expanding in use  especially in emergency and critical care medicine. Performed by appropriately trained clinicians  typically not cardiologists  FoCUS ascertains the essential information needed in critical scenarios for time-sensitive clinical decision making. A need exists for quality evidence-based review and clinical recommendations on its use. The World Interactive Network Focused on Critical UltraSound conducted an international  multispecialty  evidence-based  methodologically rigorous consensus process on FoCUS. Thirty-three experts from 16 countries were involved. A systematic multiple-database  double-track literature search (January 1980 to September 2013) was performed. The Grading of Recommendation  Assessment  Development and Evaluation method was used to determine the quality of available evidence and subsequent development of the recommendations. Evidence-based panel judgment and consensus was collected and analyzed by means of the RAND appropriateness method. During four conferences (in New Delhi  Milan  Boston  and Barcelona)  108 statements were elaborated and discussed. Face-to-face debates were held in two rounds using the modified Delphi technique. Disagreement occurred for 10 statements. Weak or conditional recommendations were made for two statements and strong or very strong recommendations for 96. These recommendations delineate the nature  applications  technique  potential benefits  clinical integration  education  and certification principles for FoCUS  both for adults and pediatric patients. This document presents the results of the first International Conference on FoCUS. For the first time  evidence-based clinical recommendations comprehensively address this branch of point-of-care ultrasound  providing a framework for FoCUS to standardize its application in different clinical settings around the world.
Traumatology,,,Systematic training in focused cardiopulmonary ultrasound affects decision-making in the prehospital setting - two case reports. We present two cases from the Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS) in Denmark  in which prehospital physicians trained in cardiac ultrasound (FATE) disclosed significant pathology that induced a radical change for the critical patient's course.
Genetics  Medical,Gynecology,Obstetrics,Attitudes towards abortion among trainees in obstetrics/gynecology and clinical genetics. This study aimed to provide knowledge about attitudes towards abortion among Danish physicians in training in the specialties of obstetrics/gynecology and clinical genetics. The study was a questionnaire survey among trainees in these specialties. Ninety-six responded. Trainees in clinical genetics were more pro-abortion than those in obstetrics/gynecology (p=0.04). Of the respondents  30 versus 48% found working with early and late abortions unpleasant. Nearly half agreed that they had chosen their specialty despite having to counsel and treat women having abortions. Twenty-one percent agreed that working with late abortion affected their job satisfaction negatively. Those agreeing with the above statements had a tendency towards lower pro-abortion scores than those who were indifferent or who disagreed but the differences were not significant. A substantial fraction of physicians in training have negative feelings associated with abortion-related work and require support in handling and coping with these challenges.
Epidemiology,,,Direct and indirect economic and health consequences of COPD in Denmark: a national register-based study: 1998-2010. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide  but longitudinal studies of the economic consequences of COPD are scarce. This Danish study evaluated for the first time ever the economic consequences of COPD of an entire nation before and after the diagnosis. Records from the Danish National Patient Registry (1998-2010)  direct and indirect costs  including frequency of primary and secondary sector contacts and procedures  medication  unemployment benefits and social transfer payments were extracted from national databases. 131 811 patients with COPD were identified and compared with 131 811 randomly selected controls matched for age  gender  educational level  residence and marital status. Direct and indirect economic and health consequences of COPD in Denmark in the time period 1998-2010. Patients with COPD had a poor survival. The average (95% CI) 12-year survival rate was 0.364 (0.364 to 0.368) compared with 0.686 among controls (0.682 to 0.690). COPD was associated with significantly higher rates of health-related contacts  medication use and higher socioeconomic costs. The employment and the income rates of employed patients with COPD were significantly lower compared with controls. The annual net costs  including social transfers were €8572 for patients with COPD. These consequences were present up to 11 years before first-time diagnosis in the secondary healthcare sector and became more pronounced with disease advancement. This study provides unique national data on direct and indirect costs before and after initial diagnosis with COPD in Denmark as well as mortality  health and economic consequences for the individual and for society. It could be speculated that early identification and intervention might contribute to the solution.
Family Practice,,,[Implementation of clinical guidelines in general practice. The effect of journal audit and continuing education for the treatment of cardiovascular risk factors in patients with and without type 2 diabetes]. The objectives of this study were  first  to describe the status of implementation of clinical guidelines for prevention of ischaemic heart disease in subjects with arterial hypertension  dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes  but without known cardiovascular disease  and  second  to describe the changes in treatment following journal audit and education of GPs. 230 general practitioners (GPs) were invited to include 20 consecutive at-risk patients. One year after the first data collection of 3 555 patients by 182 GPs  a new set of 3 023 patients was collected by 170 GPs from a new patient population. In the period between the two surveys  the GPs were educated through workshops and an international meeting focusing on cardiovascular risk factor treatment. The quality of the care being delivered was suboptimal. Approximately 15-40% of the patients had obtained the treatment goals for hypertension  dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes. Some improvement was demonstrated following education and journal audit  but a gap still exists between the recommended treatment and the treatment patients actually receive. There is a need for improvement in the implementation of clinical guidelines focusing on diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
Forensic Pathology,Forensic Toxicology,,[Eosinophilic myocarditis and sudden unexpected death in a younger patient treated with antipsychotics]. A 36 year-old man suffering from schizophrenia was found dead in his apartment. Forensic autopsy was performed due to sudden unexpected death but did not yield the cause of death. Histological examination of the heart showed eosinophilic myocarditis (EM) while forensic chemistry showed a raised level of aripripazol. We discuss the risk of sudden cardiac death in patients receiving antipsychotic drugs and the possible connection between raised drug levels and EM  and we emphasise the importance of autopsy and hope for better means in the future of finding patients at risk.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Psychological debriefing]. Diagnostic criteria for stress reactions and adjustment disorders are summarized. Existing psychological treatments are outlined with a focus on evidence-based methods  and recommendations for treatment are described. The conclusion is that there is no evidence for the effect of psychological debriefing or other professional treatment in the immediate aftermath of traumatic events. On the other hand  cognitive behavioural therapy  EMDR and similar methods with focus on exposure can be recommended  both as a preventive strategy and for patients with post-traumatic stress disorder.
Telemedicine,,,Diagnosis and outcome in a prehospital cohort of patients with bundle branch block and suspected acute myocardial infarction. Immediate revascularization is beneficial in patients with presumed new-onset bundle branch block myocardial infarction (BBBMI). In the prehospital setting  it is a challenge to diagnose new-onset BBBMI and triage accordingly. ECG  final diagnosis  and mortality were assessed in a prehospital cohort of 4905 consecutive patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Bundle branch block (BBB) was defined as QRS duration ≥120 ms caused by delayed intraventricular conduction. Mortality and angiography data were obtained from the Central Office of Civil Registration and the Western Denmark Heart Registry. Definite diagnosis of AMI and the onset of BBB were determined by expert consensus. Patients were divided into four groups: with or without AMI and with or without BBB. Mortality was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier plots and compared using log-rank statistics. AMI was diagnosed in 954 patients  of whom 118 had BBB. In 3951 patients without AMI  436 had BBB. Patients with BBBMI were less often revascularized than patients with AMI without BBB (24 vs. 54%  p<0.001). BBBMI was categorized as new onset in 43 patients of whom two were triaged for acute angioplasty. One-year mortality was 47.2  17.5  20.8  and 8.6% (log-rank <0.001) in patients with BBBMI  patients with AMI without BBB  patients with BBB without AMI  and patients without AMI or BBB  respectively. Patients with BBBMI have a high mortality. Less than 25% undergo revascularization and only very few patients with new-onset BBBMI are transferred for urgent revascularization. Focus on improving triage and prehospital identification of high-risk patients with BBB and chest pain could improve outcome.
Immunochemistry,,,Tissue distribution  intracellular localization and proteolytic processing of rat 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase. 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPD) is an important enzyme involved in tyrosine catabolism. HPD was shown to be identical to a protein named the F-antigen  exploited by immunologists because of its unique immunological properties. Congenital HPD deficiency is a rare  relatively benign condition known as hereditary type III tyrosinemia. Decreased expression of HPD is often observed in association with the severe type I tyrosinemia  and interestingly  inhibition of HPD activity seems to ameliorate the clinical symptoms of type I tyrosinemia. In this study we present a comprehensive analysis of tissue specific expression and intracellular localization of HPD in the rat. By combined use of in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry we confirm previously known sites of expression in liver and kidney. In addition  we show that HPD is abundantly expressed in neurons in the cortex  cerebellum and hippocampus. By using immunoelectron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy  we provide evidence that HPD contrary to earlier assumptions specifically localizes to membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. Detailed mass spectrometric analyses of HPD purified from rat liver revealed N-terminal and C-terminal processing of HPD  and expression of recombinant HPD suggested that C-terminal processing enhances the enzymatic activity.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Unclear effect of influenza vaccination in healthy adults]. At some Danish workplaces  healthy employees are offered an influenza vaccination  although vaccination has not been proven to have a protective effect on healthy adults. This article gives an overview of the effect of influenza vaccination on healthy adults based on the results from the Cochrane review "Vaccines for preventing influenza in healthy adults" and new studies in the field of interest. These studies show a limited effect on influenza  influenza-like illness  lost workdays  physician visits and days of illness.
Epidemiology,,,Relative mortality rates from incident chronic diseases among breast cancer survivors--a 14 year follow-up of five-year survivors diagnosed in Denmark between 1994 and 2007. It remains unknown whether incident chronic diseases are more often fatal among breast cancer survivors than among women free of breast cancer. We conducted a nationwide matched cohort study of all Danish breast cancer patients diagnosed between 1994 and 2007  who survived for five years. We compared their long-term mortality with five times as many women from the general population without breast cancer  matched on age. We used time-varying methods to compute mortality rate ratios (MRRs) for incident diseases included in the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). One third of five-year breast cancer survivors developed incident diseases during 14 years of follow-up  with about the same incidence as women without breast cancer. Mortality associated with any incident disease was similar among breast cancer survivors (MRR = 7.1  95% confidence interval (CI): 6.7  7.4) and comparison women (MRR = 7.5  95% CI: 7.3  7.7). Among breast cancer patients  relative mortality associated with incident diseases was higher among patients treated with chemotherapy (MRR = 10  95% CI: 8.7  12) and radiotherapy (MRR = 9.8  95% CI: 8.8  11) than among patients who received surgery (MRR = 7.0  95% CI: 6.7  7.4) or hormonal therapy (MRR = 6.3  95% CI: 5.8  6.9). There were no marked differences in mortality of diseases among breast cancer survivors and women from the general population. Among breast cancer patients  new diseases were more often fatal in patients treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Five-year breast cancer survivors have similar risk of dying from new chronic medical conditions as women from the general population without breast cancer.
Epidemiology,,,Impact of comorbidity on risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with breast cancer: a Danish population-based cohort study. To assess the interaction between comorbidity and breast cancer (BC) on the rate of venous thromboembolism (VTE) beyond what can be explained by the independent effects of BC and comorbidity. Population-based matched cohort study. Denmark. Danish patients with BC (n=62 376) diagnosed in 1995-2010 and a comparison cohort of women without BC (n=304 803) from the general population were matched to the patients with BC on year of birth in 5-year intervals and on the specific diseases included in the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and atrial fibrillation and obesity. The rate ratios of VTE per 1000 person-years (PY) were computed by comorbidity levels using the CCI  and interaction contrasts (IC) were calculated as a measure of the excess or deficit VTE rate not explained by the independent effects of BC and comorbidity. Among patients with BC with a CCI score of 1  the 0-1 year VTE rate was 12/1000 PY  and interaction accounted for 10% of the rate (IC=3.2  95% CI 0.5 to 5.9). Among patients with BC with CCI ≥4  the VTE rate was 17  and interaction accounted for 8% of the rate (IC=1.2  95% CI -1.8 to 4.2). There was no interaction during 2-5 years of follow-up. There was only little interaction between BC and the CCI score on the rate of VTE.
Global Health,,,The frequency of sexual intercourse reported by women: a review of community-based studies and factors limiting their conclusions. A range of methodological inconsistencies has the potential to affect reported prevalence rates of sexual intercourse. We reviewed published studies of sexual intercourse frequency reported by women and associated factors. Literature search of electronic databases. Inclusion criteria for selected cross-sectional studies were population and community-based studies of frequency of intercourse in women published in English or German languages with sample size greater than 300. Longitudinal studies were selected if duration was at least 1 year and samples were not clinically based. Frequency of sexual intercourse/activities and any associated factors. There was a great deal of variation in the mean frequency of intercourse across all age groups with higher rates reported by European and American women. There was a reduction in frequency of sexual intercourse from age 50 among women from Europe and the United States. Asian women reported increasing rates through the age group 20-30 followed by a decline. Change with age was not as evident among African and South American studies. Factors most often associated with the frequency of sexual intercourse were age  parity  duration of relationship  pregnancy  time  relationship status  fertility intentions  and contraception. There is variation in reported frequency of sexual intercourse between studies  age groups  and continents. Some of the variation may be due to variation in definitions  study designs  and methods suggesting a need for greater consistency in research practice.
Epidemiology,,,The impact of incisional hernia on mortality after colonic cancer resection. Long-term mortality after colonic cancer is not only related to the disease itself  but also to other factors such as surgical complications. Incisional hernia after abdominal surgery is a common complication; however  the impact on mortality is unknown. We thus sought to examine the impact of incisional hernia on mortality after colonic cancer resection. This was a nationwide cohort study comprising data from the Danish Colorectal Cancer Group's database  the Danish National Patient Registry (NPR)  and the Danish Central Person Registry. Patients who underwent curatively intended colonic resection for cancer with primary anastomosis between 2001 and 2008 were included. The exposure of interest was incisional hernia  as registered in the NPR  and the outcome was long-term overall mortality. Extended cox regression analysis was used to adjust for confounding variables including age  gender  comorbidity  tumor stage  and surgical approach at the index operation as well as postoperative anastomotic leakage  adjuvant chemotherapy and cancer recurrence. A total of 9214 patients were followed for median 6.4 years  during which 647 (7.0 %) were diagnosed with incisional hernia  431 (4.7 %) underwent hernia repair  and 4631 (50.3 %) died. In the multivariable analysis  incisional hernia diagnosis was not associated with increased mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 0.81  95 % confidence interval 0.70-0.93). Incarceration of the incisional hernia was associated with increased mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 2.35  95 % confidence interval 1.39-3.98)  while incisional hernia repair did not increase mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 0.81  95 % confidence interval 0.68-0.97). Incisional hernia diagnosis or repair subsequent to colonic cancer resection did not increase mortality  albeit in the rare cases of incarceration.
Ophthalmology,,,Epidemiologic characteristics of retinal detachment surgery at a specialized unit in Denmark. To examine the incidence of retinal detachments and to evaluate patient profiles and surgical characteristics. Retrospective review of patients operated for primary retinal detachment (RD) and redetachment between 2010 and 2012 at the Department of Ophthalmology  Odense University Hospital  Denmark. We included all RD such as rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD)  tractional retinal detachment (TRD) and exudative retinal detachment (ERD). In total  779 RD surgeries were performed: 83.7% (n = 652) primary operations and 16.3% (n = 127) reoperation. For primary operation  pars plana vitrectomy (PPV)  scleral buckling and combined operations were performed in 95.1% (n = 620)  4.6% (n = 30) and 0.3% (n = 2) respectively. Over time there was less use of silicone oil and greater use of gas tamponade (p = <0.001)  less simultaneous cataract operations (p = <0.001)  less use of cryotherapy (p = 0.045) and more use of peeling procedures (p = <0.001) in primary operations. The annual incidence of surgery for primary RD was 22.0 [95% confidence interval (CI) 20.4-23.8] per 100 000 inhabitants aged >15 years. Retinal detachment (RD) was more common in males than females (1.8:1)  and mean age at presentation was 61.8 years (standard deviations ± 12.3). The annual incidence for RRD and TRD operation was 20.72 (95% CI 19.11-22.43) and 1.25 (95% CI 0.9-1.7) per 100 000 inhabitants >15 years. This study presents the first overall incidence for RD in Denmark. The highest incidence of RRD was among males aged 60 to 79 years  whereas TRD was among females at same age. Pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) was the preferred surgical technique  and during 2012 all RD patients were treated with PPV  independent of lens status and age.
Ophthalmology,Epidemiology,,Ophthalmic epidemiology in Europe: the "European Eye Epidemiology" (E3) consortium. The European Eye Epidemiology (E3) consortium is a recently formed consortium of 29 groups from 12 European countries. It already comprises 21 population-based studies and 20 other studies (case-control  cases only  randomized trials)  providing ophthalmological data on approximately 170 000 European participants. The aim of the consortium is to promote and sustain collaboration and sharing of data and knowledge in the field of ophthalmic epidemiology in Europe  with particular focus on the harmonization of methods for future research  estimation and projection of frequency and impact of visual outcomes in European populations (including temporal trends and European subregions)  identification of risk factors and pathways for eye diseases (lifestyle  vascular and metabolic factors  genetics  epigenetics and biomarkers) and development and validation of prediction models for eye diseases. Coordinating these existing data will allow a detailed study of the risk factors and consequences of eye diseases and visual impairment  including study of international geographical variation which is not possible in individual studies. It is expected that collaborative work on these existing data will provide additional knowledge  despite the fact that the risk factors and the methods for collecting them differ somewhat among the participating studies. Most studies also include biobanks of various biological samples  which will enable identification of biomarkers to detect and predict occurrence and progression of eye diseases. This article outlines the rationale of the consortium  its design and presents a summary of the methodology.
Geriatrics,Rehabilitation,,Geriatric rehabilitation as an integral part of geriatric medicine in the Nordic countries. First  to outline the theoretical and practical framework for geriatric rehabilitation in the Nordic countries and second  to survey the scientific medical publications for evidence-based geriatric rehabilitation. Brainstorming on geriatric rehabilitation in a working group of Nordic teachers in geriatric medicine. Papers on scientific programmes for geriatric rehabilitation from Internet sources were collected and analyzed. All articles describing randomized studies in geriatric rehabilitation were selected for meta-analyses. The papers were divided into four groups according to diseases  infirmity and resource settings: stroke  hip-fractures  acute admissions and programmes conducted in nursing homes  day hospitals and home services. The literature survey included 30 scientific studies (9496 patients) in randomized trials with valid endpoints. Geriatric rehabilitation programmes for stroke patients in geriatric settings (six papers  1138 patients) reduced mortality and the need for nursing home placement  but the outcome for ADL function was not significantly changed. Function and length of stay varied between the studies. The outcome of geriatric rehabilitation was even more decisive in the randomized hip-fracture studies (seven articles  2414 patients): the readmission rate and cost were significantly better. Ten studies were found  comparing the outcome of acute admissions of frail elderly patients (4683) with either geriatric (GEMU  GRU) or general medical wards. The effect of rehabilitation regarding mortality rate at one year  placement in a nursing home  physical function  contentment with services  readmission rate and cost was significant improvement in the geriatric settings. Internal comparisons of geriatric programmes in nursing homes  day hospitals and in-home services (seven studies  1261 patient) revealed some differences in outcomes regarding function  contentment and costs. Specialized geriatric rehabilitation is complicated but effective when properly performed. Interdisciplinary teamwork  targeting of patients  comprehensive assessment and intensive and patient-targeted rehabilitation seem to characterize the most effective programmes. Rehabilitation of frail elderly people poses a major future challenge and has to be developed further for the sake of elderly people's quality of life as well as economic reasons.
Dietetics,,,A method for implementation of nutritional therapy in hospitals. Many barriers make implementation of nutritional therapy difficult in hospitals. In this study we investigated whether  a targeted plan made by the staff in different departments could improve nutritional treatment within selected quality goals based on the ESPEN screening guidelines. The project was carried out as a continuous quality improvement project. Four different specialities participated in the study with a nutrition team of both doctors  nurses  and a dietician  and included the following methods: (1) Pre-measurement: assessment of quality goals prior to study including the use of screening of nutritional risk (NRS-2002)  whether a nutrition plan was made  and monitoring was documented in the records. (2) INTERVENTION: multidisciplinary meeting for the ward staff using a PC-based meeting system for detecting barriers in the department concerning nutrition  elaboration of an action plan and implementation of the plan. (3) Re-measurement: as in (1) based on information from records and patient interviews  and an evaluation based on focus group interview with the staff. Patients who gave informed consent to participate in the study (>14 years) were included consecutively. Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis test was used for ordinal data  and Pearson chi(2) test for nominative data. P values <0.05 were considered significant. The study was performed in accordance with the Research Ethics Committee. In this study 141/122 patients were included before/after the implementation period with a mean weight loss within the last 3 months of 6.2 and 5.2 kg  respectively. Before the study we found that BMI was not measured. More than half of the patients had a weight loss within the last 3 months  and 40% had a weight loss during hospitalization  and this was not documented in the records. About 75% had a food intake less than normal within the last week  and nearly one-third were at a severe nutritional risk  and only 33% of these had a nutrition plan  and 18% a plan for monitoring. Barriers concerning nutrition included low priority  no focus  no routine or established procedures  and insufficient knowledge  lack of quality and choice of menus  and lack of support from general manager of the hospital. The staff introduced individually targeted procedures including assigning of responsibility  a nutrition record  electronic calculator of energy intake  upgrading of the dieticians and special diets  communication  and educational programs. A great consistency existed between barriers for targeted nutrition effort and ideas for improvement of the quality goals between the different departments. Quality assessment after study showed an overall significant improvement of the selected quality goals. The introduction of a new method for implementation of nutritional therapy according to ESPEN screening guidelines seems to improve nutritional therapy in hospitals. The method included assessment of quality goals  identification of barriers and individual targeted plans for each department followed by an evaluation process. The model has to be refined further with relevant clinical endpoints.
Telemedicine,,,Pre-hospital diagnosis and transfer of patients with acute myocardial infarction--a decade long experience from one of Europe's largest STEMI networks. Early reperfusion in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is essential. Although primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) is the preferred revascularization technique  it often involves longer primary transportation or secondary inter-hospital transfers and thus longer system related delays. The current ESC Guidelines state that PCI should be performed within 120 minutes from first medical contact  and door-to-balloon time should be <60 minutes in order to reduce long term mortality. STEMI networks should be established with regionalization of pPCI treatment to address the challenges regarding pre-hospital treatment  triage and transport of STEMI patients and collaborations between hospitals and Emergency Medical Services (EMS). We report on a regional decade long experience from one of Europe's largest STEMI networks located in Eastern Denmark  which serves a catchment area of 2.5 million inhabitants by processing ~4000 prehospital ECGs annually transmitted from 4 EMS systems to a single pPCI center treating 1100 patients per year. This organization has led to a significant improvement of the standard of therapy for acute myocardial infarction (MI) patients leading to historically low 30-day mortality for STEMI patients (<6%). About 70-80% of all STEMI patients are being triaged from the field and rerouted to the regional pPCI center. Significant delays are still found among patients who present to local hospitals and for those who are first admitted to a local emergency room and thus subject to inter-hospital transfer. In the directly transferred group  approximately 80% of patients can be treated within the current guideline time window of 120 minutes when triaged within a 185 km (~115 miles) radius. Since 2010  a Helicopter Emergency Medical Service has been implemented for air rescue. Air transfer was associated with a 20-30 minute decrease from first medical contact to pPCI  at distances down to 90 km from the pPCI center and with a trend toward better survival among air transported patients. The pPCI center also serves a small island in the Baltic Sea  where STEMI patients are rescued via air force helicopters. Based on data from more than 100 patients transferred over the past decade  we have found a similar in-hospital and long term mortality rate compared to the main island inhabitants. In conclusion  with the optimal collaboration within a STEMI network including local hospitals  university clinics  EMS and military helicopters using the same telemedicine system and field triage of STEMI patients  most patients can be treated within the time limits suggested by the current guidelines. These organizational changes are likely to contribute to the improved mortality rate for STEMI patients.
Gynecology,,,Are sociodemographic and regional and sample factors associated with prevalence of abuse? The aims of the present study were: 1) to estimate the prevalence of emotional  physical and sexual abuse and abuse in the health care system  and 2) to study the associations between prevalence of abuse and sociodemographic and sample variables. This cross-sectional study used a validated postal questionnaire in four Swedish samples; patients at three gynecologic clinics with different character and in different regions (n = 2439) and women in one randomized population sample (n = 1168). Any lifetime emotional abuse was reported by 16.8-21.4% of the women; physical abuse by 32.1-37.5%; sexual abuse by 15.9-17.0%; and abuse in the health care system by 14.0-19.7%. For 7-8% abuse had included life threats and 9-20% of all women in the study currently suffered from their experiences of abuse. Most women had not disclosed their background of abuse to the gynecologist. There were differences in sociodemographic variables between the four samples. Generally  in the multivariate analyses we found associations between prevalence of abuse and age  educational level  civil status and occupation  but no consistent association between prevalence of abuse and sample variables. Lifetime prevalence rates of the four kinds of abuse were high in all samples as measured by the NorVold Abuse Questionnaire (NorAQ)  and 1/10-1/5 women in the study suffered currently from abusive experiences. In multivariate analyses prevalence of abuse was consistently associated with sociodemographic but not to sample variables.
General Surgery,,,[Organisation and reimbursement of surgical practice in Denmark 2004-2008]. The organisation and the reimbursement pattern for surgery in Denmark are relatively unknown. The organisation and activity of hip and knee replacement  laparoscopic cholecystectomy and inguinal herniotomy  low-back surgery and obesity surgery were analysed together with the surgery reimbursement pattern in Denmark in the 5-year period 2004-2008 based on national register data. During the 4-year period 2004-2007 activity rose for all types of surgery  except laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A predominant part of the increased activity was seen within the private sector  especially in obesity and low-back surgery. A predominant part of the activity in the private sector was financed via public sector funding. The results show increased surgical activity in five common operations and call for intensified monitoring of activity and quality to secure research and further development on a nationwide basis.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Prophylactic probiotics for preterm infants reduces mortality]. Meta-analyses indicate that prophylactic probiotics for preterm infants reduces mortality and necrotising enterocolitis significantly. Despite the robust evidence clinicians are reluctant to implement probiotics because the beneficial mechanism is not clearly understood and due to concerns about the safety  the long-term effects  and the optimal treatment regimen. Hence  only few countries and only two-thirds of the Danish neonatal departments use probiotics. Currently three large randomised trials on probiotics vs. placebo are ongoing and it is an ethical dilemma whether to proceed or terminate the trials.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Danish recommendations on treatment of ankylosing spondylitis and spondyloarthritis based on multinational project initiative]. The multinational initiative "3e Initiative in Rheumatology - Multi-national Recommendations for the Management of Ankylosing Spondylitis 2006-7" served the primary purpose of providing specific recommendations for the management of ankylosing spondylitis and spondyloarthritis patients in daily practice. The scientific committees from the ten participating countries selected nine clinical questions regarding diagnosis  monitoring and pharmacologic non-biologic treatment  and the Danish group chose 2 additional questions about non-pharmacologic treatment. Systematic literature searches were performed in Medline by 3 international and a Danish bibliographic fellow. Outcome data were extracted and processed by use of routine methods from clinical epidemiology and statistics. The evidence was presented to the Danish rheumatologists. The participants were divided into three groups  which each proposed recommendations. After a final plenary discussion  a voting session took place. Subsequently  agreement was obtained  and the strength of the recommendations was graded. The bibliographic fellows identified 2 709 relevant manuscripts and included 477 of these in the analysis. All 186 Danish rheumatologists were invited  and 26 (14 0%) participated in the meeting held in Copenhagen  December 2006. The individual recommendations were endorsed by 68-100% of the participants. Within the framework of the multinational 3e project  it was possible to develop Danish recommendations for AS patients by combining an evidence-based approach and the experience of clinical rheumatologists.
General Practice,,,The presence of resuscitation equipment and influencing factors at General Practitioners' offices in Denmark: a cross-sectional study. Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) have proven effective when used by GPs. Despite this and the latest guidelines from the European Resuscitation Council  there are no recommendations for Danish GPs regarding proper equipment to treat cardiac arrest. Currently  there are no published data on the distribution of AEDs among GPs in Denmark. To assess the prevalence of resuscitation equipment and educated staff among Danish GPs and the parameters influencing the absence of AEDs at GP offices. A cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey among the 2030 GPs registered in Denmark. Questions concerned demographics  occurrence of resuscitation equipment and attitude towards acquisition of an AED. With a response rate >70%  we found that the prevalence of AEDs in GP offices is low (31.7%). Limited financial possibilities and relevant treatment by ambulance personnel were stated as the primary causes for not having an AED. In general  Danish primary care physicians believe that AEDs should be governmentally sponsored. Positive influential factors on the acquisition of an AED were education  number of physicians in the GP office and previous experience of cardiac arrest. Danish primary care physicians are generally not equipped with AEDs despite the proven effect of AEDs in GP offices. The main reasons for not acquiring an AED are financial considerations and believing that response time by ambulance services and nearby health facilities are the optimal treatment. We recommend better education and information in order to facilitate future acquisition of AEDs among GPs.
Community Psychiatry,,,Crisis homes for adult psychiatric patients. Inspired by the Crisis Home programme in Madison  we have adapted and evaluated the programme at the Community Mental Health (CMH) Centre in Tønder  Denmark. Procedures and schedules from the Crisis Home programme were applied in this open trial. Questionnaire data concerning satisfaction with the stay and registration data concerning the admissions and bed days two years before and two years after the first stay were obtained. During four years  52 different patients had a total of 187 stays in a crisis home. Twenty (38.5%) of the patients were attached to the ACT team. The average duration of the stays was 4.0 days. The number of readmissions and bed days after the first stay showed a significant downward tendency for the subgroup of patients with a more severe mental disorder  but not for the whole group. The patients  the crisis homes families and the referrers were very satisfied with the programme and the treatment. Crisis home stays represent a quality improvement in the treatment package  especially for patients with a more severe mental disorder. Further documentation will require a controlled study.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Promising web-based introductory course in research training]. The Faculty of Health Sciences  University of Southern Denmark has developed a course in research training for residents  where traditional face-to-face teaching is mixed with computer-supported collaborative learning. The course focuses on the ability to ask research questions  retrieve information and appraise scientific papers. Initially  many course participants are reluctant to the course concept. Yet a majority of participants are very active online and give the course good evaluations. The course concept seems well-suited to "scaffold" participants' acquisition of research methodology competences.
Epidemiology,,,Aortic events in a nationwide Marfan syndrome cohort. Marfan syndrome is associated with morbidity and mortality due to aortic dilatation and dissection. Preventive aortic root replacement has been the standard treatment in Marfan syndrome patients with aortic dilatation. In this study  we present aortic event data from a nationwide Marfan syndrome cohort. The nationwide cohort of Danish Marfan syndrome patients was established from the Danish National Patient Registry and the Cause of Death Register  where we retrieved information about aortic surgery and dissections. We associated aortic events with age  sex  and Marfan syndrome diagnosis prior or after the first aortic event. From the total cohort of 412 patients  150 (36.4 %) had an aortic event. Fifty percent were event free at age 49.6. Eighty patients (53.3 %) had prophylactic surgery and seventy patients (46.7 %) a dissection. The yearly event rate was 0.02 events/year/patient in the period 1994-2014. Male patients had a significant higher risk of an aortic event at a younger age with a hazard ratio of 1.75 (CI 1.26-2.42  p = 0.001) compared with women. Fifty-three patients (12.9 %) were diagnosed with MFS after their first aortic event which primarily was aortic dissection [n = 44 (83.0 %)]. More than a third of MFS patients experienced an aortic event and male patients had significantly more aortic events than females. More than half of the total number of dissections was in patients undiagnosed with MFS at the time of their event. This emphasizes that diagnosing MFS is lifesaving and improves mortality risk by reducing the risk of aorta dissection.
Epidemiology,,,Infections as risk factor for autoimmune diseases - A nationwide study. Viruses  bacteria and other infectious pathogens are the major postulated environmental triggers of autoimmunity. In the present nation-wide study we describe the association between infections and 29 autoimmune diseases. We used the Danish Civil Registration System to identify 4.5 million persons born between 1945 and 2000. Information on infections and autoimmune diseases was obtained from the Danish Hospital Register. The cohort was followed from 1977 to 2012. Incidence rate ratios for developing an autoimmune disease were estimated using poisson regression. We found an association between hospital admission for an infection and 29 autoimmune diseases. This study shows that infections are risk factors for a broad spectrum of autoimmune diseases in a dose-response and temporal manner  in agreement with the hypothesis that infections are an environmental risk factor contributing to the etiology of autoimmune diseases together with genetic factors.
Forensic Genetics,,,Identifying the most likely contributors to a Y-STR mixture using the discrete Laplace method. In some crime cases  the male part of the DNA in a stain can only be analysed using Y chromosomal markers  e.g. Y-STRs. This may be the case in e.g. rape cases  where the male components can only be detected as Y-STR profiles  because the fraction of male DNA is much smaller than that of female DNA  which can mask the male results when autosomal STRs are investigated. Sometimes  mixtures of Y-STRs are observed  e.g. in rape cases with multiple offenders. In such cases  Y-STR mixture analysis is required  e.g. by mixture deconvolution  to deduce the most likely DNA profiles from the contributors. We demonstrate how the discrete Laplace method can be used to separate a two person Y-STR mixture  where the Y-STR profiles of the true contributors are not present in the reference dataset  which is often the case for Y-STR profiles in real case work. We also briefly discuss how to calculate the weight of the evidence using the likelihood ratio principle when a suspect's Y-STR profile fits into a two person mixture. We used three datasets with between 7 and 21 Y-STR loci: Denmark (n=181)  Somalia (n=201) and Germany (n=3443). The Danish dataset with 21 loci was truncated to 15 and 10 loci to examine the effect of the number of loci. For each of these datasets  an out of sample simulation study was performed: A total of 550 mixtures were composed by randomly sampling two haplotypes  h1 and h2  from the dataset. We then used the discrete Laplace method on the remaining data (excluding h1 and h2) to rank the contributor pairs by the product of the contributors' estimated haplotype frequencies. Successful separation of mixtures (defined by the observation that the true contributor pair was among the 10 most likely contributor pairs) was found in 42-52% of the cases for 21 loci  69-75% for 15 loci and 92-99% for 10 loci or less depending on the dataset and how the discrete Laplace model was chosen. Y-STR mixtures with many loci are difficult to separate  but even haplotypes with 21 Y-STR loci can be separated.
Hospital Administration,Sociology  Medical,,"Villagers": differential treatment in a Ghanaian hospital. Differential treatment of patients by health workers in African medical institutions is acknowledged by patients  health workers and policy-makers alike to be an obstacle in the realization of government objectives of equity in health care. This qualitative study understands the production and legitimization of differential treatment from the perspective of health workers. On the basis of qualitative field material from a hospital in Northern Ghana the relation between socio-cultural  biomedical and bureaucratic aspects of hospital practice is explored through a focus on categorizations of patients. It is concluded that to blame the "bad attitudes" of health workers for differential treatment is not an adequate explanation. It is important to acknowledge that differential treatment can be understood as a form of agency  and is related to the conditions of hospital work and to the professional and social identities of health workers.
General Practice,,,Epidemiological factors associated with ESBL- and non ESBL-producing E. coli causing urinary tract infection in general practice. The purpose of the study was to evaluate how use of antibiotics precedes the presence of ESBL-producing E.coli in general practice. The authors performed a triple-case-control study where three case groups were individually compared to a single control group of uninfected individuals. Urine samples were prospectively collected and retrospective statistical analyses were done. This study included 98 cases with urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by ESBL-producing E. coli  174 with antibiotic-resistant (non-ESBL) E. coli  177 with susceptible E. coli and 200 with culture negative urine samples. Case groups had significantly higher use of antibiotics than the control group within 30 days before infection (p < 0.0001). The ESBL group had significantly more hospital admissions than the other case groups (p < 0.05). Hospital admission was an independent risk factor for community onset UTI by ESBL-producing E. coli. Exposure to antibiotics was a risk factor for UTI with E. coli  while prior antibiotic usage was not an indisputable predictor for infection with ESBL-producing E.coli in general practice.
Preventive Medicine,,,Risk factors for suicidal thoughts in adolescence--a prospective cohort study: the Young-HUNT study. Examining the associations between health and lifestyle factors recorded in the participants' early teens and development of suicidal thoughts recorded 4 years later. Population-based prospective cohort study. All students in the two relevant year classes in Nord-Trøndelag County were invited  80% attended both waves of data collection. 2399 secondary school students who participated in the Young-HUNT1 study in 1995-1997 (13-15 years old) were included in a follow-up study 4 years later (17-19 years old). Suicidal thoughts reported at age 17-19 years. 408 (17%  95% CI 15.5% to 18.5%) of the adolescents reported suicidal thoughts at follow-up  158 (14.2%  CI 13.6% to 16.4%) boys and 250 (19.5%  CI 18.8% to 22.0%) girls. Baseline anxiety and depressive symptoms (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.9  CI 1.4 to 2.6)  conduct problems (aOR 1.8  CI 1.3 to 2.6)  overweight (aOR 1.9 CI 1.4 to 2.4)  and muscular pain and tension (aOR 1.8  CI 1.4 to 2.4)  were all associated with reporting suicidal thoughts at follow-up. One in six young adults experienced suicidal thoughts  girls predominating. Suicidal thoughts were most strongly associated with symptoms of anxiety/depression  conduct problems  pain/tension and overweight reported when participants were 13-15 years old. Specific preventive efforts in these groups might be indicated. Future research should investigate whether similar associations are seen with suicide/suicidal attempts as endpoints.
Family Practice,,,Examination of final-year medical students in general practice. With general practice recognized as one of three major subjects in the Tromsø medical school curriculum  a matching examination counterpart was needed. The aim was to develop and implement an examination in an authentic general practice setting for final-year medical students. In a general practice surgery  observed by two examiners and one fellow student  the student performs a consultation with a consenting patient who would otherwise have consulted his/her general practitioner (GP). An oral examination follows. It deals with the consultation process  the observed communication between "doctor" and patient  and with clinical problem-solving  taking today's patient as a starting point. The session is closed by discussion of a public-health-related question. Since 2004 the model has been evaluated through questionnaires to students  examiners  and patients  and through a series of review meetings among examiners and students. Examination in general practice using unselected  consenting patients mimics real life to a high degree. It constitutes one important element in a comprehensive assessment process. This is considered to be an acceptable and appropriate way of testing the students before graduation.
Family Practice,,,[Fewer regular general practitioners participate in out-of-hours emergency services]. The aim of the study was to determine whether the official numbers of regular general practitioners (GPs) participating in out-of-hours duty have been correct. Data were collected from the Norwegian labour and welfare organisation's (NAV's) regular GP database. This is a database with information collected from Statistics Norway and the Norwegian Social Science Data Services. The study has revealed an error in one of the sources used by the national health authorities to evaluate the regular GP Scheme "Fastlegeordningen". Official figures indicate that the number of regular GPs who participate in out-of-hours duty increased with 5% the first three years after implementation of the regular GP Scheme (2001-2004). New analyses show that the number of regular GPs instead decreased with 12%. Our study uncovers weaknesses with the quality assurance of data used by the health authorities to calculate the work force needed for out-of-hours duty. This misinformation may have prevented action needed to recruit regular GPs to work in the out-of-hours emergency services  as the problem has not been recognised.
Family Practice,,,Family medicine research: implications for Wonca. The purpose of the article is to illustrate where in the lifelong curriculum of family medicine ought students  trainees  and family physicians learn about research in family medicine. The role of Wonca to promote this endeavor is discussed. I describe the recruitment and training programs for family physicians and state the implication for Wonca to promote family medicine research in the undergraduate curriculum  during residency  and in the graduate study programs for experienced medical doctors. I describe the possible research fields in family medicine and the special methods that can be used to get reliable and valid answers to relevant questions in family medicine. It is time for Wonca to develop a policy for family medicine research by developing a strategy to promote it. This can be done through a Wonca policy statement about family medicine research in the medical curriculum. Wonca can  in collaboration with national colleges  arrange workshops and master classes in research; create scholarships and fellowships for international family medicine researchers; influence journals and international bodies  such as the World Health Organization  governments  and colleges about the necessity of good family medical research; describe ethical guidelines for international primary care research; and create a number of databases for researchers to use.
Midwifery,,,[Obstetric aid seen in relation to the Nissen-family in Hillerup and on Spøttrup from about 1771 to 1835]. The very rich owner of the medieval castle Spøttrup in Sailing  Jutland died without any descendents. A lot has been written about the Nissen-family  but the circumstances by the deliveries of their children are not explained before. In the local churchbook six of seven deliveries from 1825 to 1835 are described as it was demanded to document and explain birth of dead children to control the skills of the midwives. Only one child survived the birth  and he died in the age of eight month. In the other six cases several ways of attempts to resuscitate the babies are described. One baby had its head crushed by the forceps  and at the last delivery the midwife did not show up  as she assisted at another place. The doctor then had to assist without help. The education of midwives in Denmark took place in Copenhagen  but in lack of a sufficient number  alternative education was given by local doctors ('stiftsfysicus') in Ribe and in Viborg  both in Jutland. The bishop of Viborg  Tetens  tried to help the local 'stiftsfysicus' to establish a school for midwives in Viborg in about 1783  but without success. A grandson of the bishop was the doctor  who unsuccessfully handled the forceps at a delivery at Spøttrup and who also had the honor to assist at the last delivery without the help from a midwife.
Pathology,,,ERG protein expression in diagnostic specimens is associated with increased risk of progression during active surveillance for prostate cancer. Compelling biomarkers identifying prostate cancer patients with a high risk of progression during active surveillance (AS) are needed. To examine the association between ERG expression at diagnosis and the risk of progression during AS. This study included 265 patients followed on AS with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurements  clinical examinations  and 10-12 core rebiopsies from 2002 to 2012 in a prospectively maintained database. ERG immunohistochemical staining was performed on diagnostic paraffin-embedded formalin-fixed sections with a ready-to-use kit (anti-ERG  EPR3864). Men were characterised as ERG positive if a minimum of one tumour focus demonstrated ERG expression. Overall AS progression was defined as clinical progression: increased clinical tumour category ≥cT2b by digital rectal examination and ultrasound  and/or histopathologic progression: upgrade of Gleason score  more than three positive cores or bilateral positive cores  and/or PSA progression: PSA doubling time <3 yr. Risk of progression was analysed using multiple cause-specific Cox regression and stratified cumulative incidences (Aalen-Johansen method). Curatively intended treatment  watchful waiting  and death without progression were treated as competing events. A total of 121 of 142 ERG-negative and 96 of 123 ERG-positive patients had complete diagnostic information. In competing risk models  the ERG-positive group showed significantly higher incidences of overall AS progression (p<0.0001) and of the subgroups PSA progression (p<0.0001) and histopathologic progression (p<0.0001). The 2-yr cumulative incidence of overall AS progression was 21.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]  14.3-29.1) in the ERG-negative group compared with 58.6% (95% CI  48.7-68.5) in the ERG-positive group. ERG positivity was a significant predictor of overall AS progression in multiple Cox regression (hazard ratio: 2.45; 95% CI  1.62-3.72; p<0.0001). The main limitation of this study is its observational nature. In our study  ERG positivity at diagnosis can be used to estimate the risk of progression during AS. If confirmed  ERG status can be used to individualise AS programmes. The tissue biomarker ERG identifies active surveillance patients with an increased risk of disease progression.
Pathology  Surgical,,,Handling of radical prostatectomy specimens: total or partial embedding? Proper examination and accurate reporting of radical prostatectomy specimens (RPS) is essential in determining post-surgical treatment and predicting patient outcome. Surveys have demonstrated the absence of consensus on handling of RPS. The aim of this study was to determine whether significant information is lost when only half the horizontal tissue sections are examined. During a 1-year period  238 RPS were sectioned into horizontal slices. Apex and basis was cut sagittally  and remaining slices were embedded in quadrants. Glass slides from every second horizontal slice were withheld. The remaining slides were evaluated microscopically  and essential pathological parameters were recorded. Subsequently  a full report was compiled  including the withheld slides. A median of 12 slides (30%) were withheld during initial assessment. In eight RPS (3.2%) the pTNM stage had to be changed; in six cases (2.6%) from pT2b to pT2c and in two cases (0.8%) from pT2c to pT3a. In one RPS (0.4%) the surgical margin status was changed. Only little information is lost with systematic partial embedding  overlooking features significant for the postoperative treatment in only 1.2%. Partial embedding as suggested  decreasing the laboratory workload by 30%  is concluded to be acceptable for valid histopathological assessment.
Anesthesiology,Orthopedics,Perioperative Nursing,Experience of an orthoplastic limb salvage team after the Haiti earthquake: analysis of caseload and early outcomes. After the devastating earthquake in Haiti on January 12  2010  a British orthoplastic limb salvage team was mobilized. The team operated in a suburb of Port-au-Prince from January 20  2010. This analysis gives an overview of the caseload and early outcomes. A retrospective analysis of operative data from the log book was performed from the opening of the facility on January 20  2010  until March 12  2010. In total  348 operations were carried out on 158 patients  at an average of 47 cases per week. Seventy-three percent of the cases were soft-tissue cases and 25 percent were bony or combined soft-tissue and bony cases. The majority of bony procedures (n = 26; 16 percent) and flap procedures (n = 16; 10 percent) took place in the early weeks (weeks 1 through 4). Combined orthoplastic cases accounted for 37 percent of cases (16 of 44) in week 2 but only 7 percent (three of 43) in week 7. General anesthetic cases accounted for 89 percent of cases (39 of 44) in week 2 but only 40 percent (17 of 43) in week 7. Only six patients (4 percent) underwent amputation  but 36 operations (10 percent) dealt with the sequelae of amputation. Sixteen patients (10 percent) suffered complications  including two amputations for failed limb salvage. This article reports the outcomes of a limb salvage team in the acute response after an earthquake disaster with a favorable amputation rate and highlights the potential benefit of mobilizing this type of team. Detailing the changing caseload over time will allow for more efficient planning in case of a similar future disaster.
Toxicology,,,Science and policy on endocrine disrupters must not be mixed: a reply to a "common sense" intervention by toxicology journal editors. The "common sense" intervention by toxicology journal editors regarding proposed European Union endocrine disrupter regulations ignores scientific evidence and well-established principles of chemical risk assessment. In this commentary  endocrine disrupter experts express their concerns about a recently published  and is in our considered opinion inaccurate and factually incorrect  editorial that has appeared in several journals in toxicology. Some of the shortcomings of the editorial are discussed in detail. We call for a better founded scientific debate which may help to overcome a polarisation of views detrimental to reaching a consensus about scientific foundations for endocrine disrupter regulation in the EU.
Radiation Oncology,,,[Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for patients with somatostatin receptor expressing tumours. German Guideline (S1)]. This document describes the guideline for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) published by the German Society of Nuclear Medicine (DGN) and accepted by the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany (AWMF) to be included in the official AWMF Guideline Registry. These recommendations are a prerequisite for the quality management in the treatment of patients with somatostatin receptor expressing tumours using PRRT. They are aimed at guiding nuclear medicine specialists in selecting likely candidates to receive PRRT and to deliver the treatment in a safe and effective manner. The recommendations are based on an interdisciplinary consensus. The document contains background information and definitions and covers the rationale  indications and contraindications for PRRT. Essential topics are the requirements for institutions performing the therapy  e. g. presence of an expert for medical physics  intense cooperation with all colleagues involved in the treatment of a patient  and a certificate of instruction in radiochemical labelling and quality control are required. Furthermore  it is specified which patient data have to be available prior to performance of therapy and how treatment has to be carried out technically. Here  quality control and documentation of labelling are of great importance. After treatment  clinical quality control is mandatory (work-up of therapy data and follow-up of patients). Essential elements of follow-up are specified in detail. The complete treatment inclusive after-care has to be realised in close cooperation with the involved medical disciplines. Generally  the decision for PRRT should be undertaken within the framework of a multi-disciplinary tumour board.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy. Exact and cost-effective coronary disease imaging--secondary publication]. Mortality rates due to coronary arterial disease (CAD) have declined as result of improved prevention  diagnosis and management  but CAD remains the leading cause of death. Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) provides a cost-effective tool for early detection of CAD in symptomatic individuals and can stratify patients according to risk of cardiac events. MPS also provides valuable information to assist clinical decision-making. A large body of evidence supports the current applications of MPS  which has become integral to several guidelines for clinical practice.
Specialization,,,[Children with hip pain should be seen by a specialist]. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) is a relatively rare growth disturbance in the proximal femoral growth plate. It results in posterior displacement of the femoral head. Symptoms are an intermittent hip  knee or groin pain  which is exacerbated by sports  giving restricted hip motion  and sometimes a limping gait with out-toeing. SCFE is typically seen in overweight boys  but may also occur in normal-weight teenage girls. Early image diagnostic assessment of both hips is crucial  since slip severity and consequently the risk of disabling complications are strongly correlated to late diagnosis.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Quality of outpatient tonsillectomy performed in ear  nose & throat practice]. In Danish healthcare there are increasing demands in the field of hospital care on performance and outcome measurement and quality improvement in relation to a number of diseases. Hitherto  corresponding measurements of quality have not been carried out among private specialized practitioners. The present project describes the development and selection of evidence-based national indicators  standards  and case mix factors in terms of prognostic factors with the purpose of measuring quality of out-patient tonsillectomy in Danish ear  nose & throat practices.
Evidence-Based Practice,,,[Checklists have a potential in health care]. A checklist is a cognitive tool specifying the actions necessary to complete a given task. It serves to improve the quality of care  support the memory of the user and it may serve to indicate the necessary communicative steps within a team. Checklists are used increasingly in health care. Preliminary results indicate a potential for patient safety. However  no evidence indicates that a checklist in itself is sufficient to obtain clinical results: training and motivating staff  supporting implementation  and conducting follow-up and evaluation are as important as the checklist itself to achieve results.
Stroke Rehabilitation,,,Shortened constraint-induced movement therapy in subacute stroke - no effect of using a restraint: a randomized controlled study with independent observers. To examine the effect of using a mitt during shortened constraint-induced movement therapy for patients in the subacute phase after stroke. Twenty-four patients with stroke (mean age 57.6 (standard deviation (SD) 8.5) years; average 7 weeks post-stroke) with mild to moderate impaired hand function. The patients were randomized to mitt use or no mitt use on the less affected hand for 90% of waking hours for 12 days. All patients received 3 h of arm and hand training per day for 2 weeks. Assessments were made by blinded observers using the modified Motor Assessment Scale  the Sollerman hand function test  the 2-Point Discrimination test and Motor Activity Log test. Patients in both groups showed significant improvements in arm and hand motor performance and on self-reported motor ability after 2 weeks of therapy and at 3 months follow-up. However  no statistically significant differences between the groups were found in any measures at any point in time. In this study  no effect of using a restraint in patients with subacute stroke was found. Thus  this component in the constraint-induced therapy concept seems to be of minor importance for the outcome.
Stroke Rehabilitation,,,Constraint-induced movement therapy in patients with stroke: a pilot study on effects of small group training and of extended mitt use. (1) To evaluate constraint-induced movement therapy for chronic stroke patients modified into group practice to limit the demand on therapist resources. (2) To explore whether extended mitt use alone may enhance outcome. A combined case-control and randomized controlled study with pre- and post-treatment measures by blinded observers. A university hospital rehabilitation department. Sixteen stroke patients (nine men and seven women; mean age 56.7 years; on average 28.9 months post stroke  five of whom were 6-9 months post stroke) with moderate motor impairments in the contralateral upper limb. Constraint-induced therapy (mitt on the less affected hand 90% of waking hours for 12 days) with 2-3 patients per therapist and 6 h of group training per day. After the training period  the patients were randomized either to using the mitt at home every other day for two-week periods for another three months (in total 21 days) or to no further treatment. Modified Motor Assessment Scale  Sollerman Hand Function Test  Two-Point Discrimination test and Motor Activity Log. The mean motor performance improved significantly after two weeks of constraint-induced group therapy on Motor Assessment Scale (1.44 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.59-2.28) points; P = 0.003) and on Sollerman Hand Function Test (3.81 (95% CI 0.26-7.36) points; P = 0.037) but showed no sensory change in the Two-Point Discrimination Test (P = 0.283). The median difference in self-reported motor ability (Motor Activity Log) also improved (P < 0.001). However  no additional effect was seen from wearing a mitt for another three months. Constraint-induced group therapy  allowing several patients per therapist  seems to be a feasible alternative to improve upper limb motor function. The restraint alone  extended in time  did not enhance the treatment effect.
General Practice,,,The efficacy of computer reminders on external quality assessment for point-of-care testing in Danish general practice: rationale and methodology for two randomized trials. Point-of-care testing (POCT) is increasingly being used in general practice to assist general practitioners (GPs) in their management of patients with diseases. However  low adherence to quality guidelines in terms of split test procedures has been observed among GPs in parts of the Capital Region in Denmark. Computer reminders embedded in GPs electronic medical records (ComRem) may facilitate improved quality control behaviour  but more research is needed to identify what types of reminders work and when. The overall aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ComRem to improve GPs adherence to quality guidelines. This article describes the rationale and methods of the study that constitute this research project. The study is conducted as two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) among general practices in two districts of the Capital Region in Denmark. These districts contain a total of 739 GPs in 567 practices with a total of 1.1 million patients allocated to practice lists. In the first RCT (RCT A)  ComRem is compared to postal reminder letters. In the second RCT (RCT B)  ComRem is compared to usual activities (no reminders) with a crossover approach. In both of these studies  outcomes are measured by the number of split tests received by the laboratory. This study will contribute to knowledge on the efficacy of ComRem in primary care. Because the study does not explore GPs' perceptions and experiences with regard to ComRem  we will subsequently conduct a qualitative survey focusing on these aspects. Study A: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01152151Study B: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01152177.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Clinical practice and evidence in endoscopic treatment of bleeding peptic gastroduodenal ulcer. To investigate treatment practice in non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB) caused by gastroduodenal ulcer and how it adheres to the best evidence as documented in randomized studies and meta-analyses. The literature was surveyed to identify appropriate practices  and a structured multiple choice questionnaire developed and mailed to all departments in Denmark treating UGIB. All 42 departments responded. All had therapeutic gastroscopes and equipment necessary for endoscopic haemostasis; 90% of departments had written guidelines. Adjuvant pharmacologic treatment included tranexamic acid in 38%. Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) were used by all departments  with 29% starting prior to endoscopic treatment. Eight departments (19%) used continuous PPI infusion  three of them starting with a bolus dose. In 50% of departments an anaesthesiologist was always present regardless of whether endotracheal intubation (routinely used by 10%) was used or not. Ten percent did not treat Forrest IIa and IIb ulcers  while IIc ulcers were treated by 36%. In 10% of departments clots were never removed  while in 2/3 attempts were made to remove resistant clots by mechanic means. Seven departments (17%) used monotherapy with epinephrine  while 59% always used dual therapy; 19% injected less than 10 ml. In rebleeding  92% attempted endoscopic treatment before surgery  and used epinephrine in 79% of cases  while the remainder used epinephrine or polidocanol at the discretion of the endoscopist. Two out of three departments used high-dependency or intensive-care units for surveillance. Seventeen percent applied scheduled second-look gastroscopy. Practice is variable  even in areas with established evidence based on randomized controlled studies  such as dosage and way of administration and duration of PPI treatment  injection treatment used as monotherapy and the volume used  including ulcers with clots for treatment  and the use of scheduled second-look endoscopy. Since the rebleeding rate has remained unchanged for decades  and rebleeding implies increased surgery and mortality rates  appropriate practices must be promoted in order to improve results. Development and implementation of national guidelines may facilitate the process.
Allergy and Immunology,,,Cutaneous manifestations in patients with mastocytosis: Consensus report of the European Competence Network on Mastocytosis; the American Academy of Allergy  Asthma & Immunology; and the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology. Cutaneous lesions in patients with mastocytosis are highly heterogeneous and encompass localized and disseminated forms. Although a classification and criteria for cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) have been proposed  there remains a need to better define subforms of cutaneous manifestations in patients with mastocytosis. To address this unmet need  an international task force involving experts from different organizations (including the European Competence Network on Mastocytosis; the American Academy of Allergy  Asthma & Immunology; and the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology) met several times between 2010 and 2014 to discuss the classification and criteria for diagnosis of cutaneous manifestations in patients with mastocytosis. This article provides the major outcomes of these meetings and a proposal for a revised definition and criteria. In particular  we recommend that the typical maculopapular cutaneous lesions (urticaria pigmentosa) should be subdivided into 2 variants  namely a monomorphic variant with small maculopapular lesions  which is typically seen in adult patients  and a polymorphic variant with larger lesions of variable size and shape  which is typically seen in pediatric patients. Clinical observations suggest that the monomorphic variant  if it develops in children  often persists into adulthood  whereas the polymorphic variant may resolve around puberty. This delineation might have important prognostic implications  and its implementation in diagnostic algorithms and future mastocytosis classifications is recommended. Refinements are also suggested for the diagnostic criteria of CM  removal of telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans from the current classification of CM  and removal of the adjunct solitary from the term solitary mastocytoma.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Cholesterol reduction in patients with lower limb atherosclerotic disease. Patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) have a 2-3 times increased risk of death and in the most severe stage  critical peripheral ischaemia  the mortality rate is around 50% within 4-5. This poor survival rate is due to concomitant coronary and cerebrovascular atherosclerotic disease. Among the major risk factors for atherosclerosis are dyslipidaemia  smoking  hypertension and diabetes. Large randomised trials have shown that dyslipidaemia is easily modifiable in both patients with and without established coronary artery disease  with significant reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although none of these trials directly measured peripheral vascular status  there is every indication that conclusions submitted for patients with ischaemic heart disease can be translated to patients with peripheral vascular disease. The object of this review was therefore to divulge current evidence available supporting active treatment of dyslipidaemia in patients with peripheral vascular disease.
Global Health,,,Causes of Death Data in the Global Burden of Disease Estimates for Ischemic and Hemorrhagic Stroke. Stroke mortality estimates in the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study are based on routine mortality statistics and redistribution of ill-defined codes that cannot be a cause of death  the so-called 'garbage codes' (GCs). This study describes the contribution of these codes to stroke mortality estimates. All available mortality data were compiled and non-specific cause codes were redistributed based on literature review and statistical methods. Ill-defined codes were redistributed to their specific cause of disease by age  sex  country and year. The reassignment was done based on the International Classification of Diseases and the pathology behind each code by checking multiple causes of death and literature review. Unspecified stroke and primary and secondary hypertension are leading contributing 'GCs' to stroke mortality estimates for hemorrhagic stroke (HS) and ischemic stroke (IS). There were marked differences in the fraction of death assigned to IS and HS for unspecified stroke and hypertension between GBD regions and between age groups. A large proportion of stroke fatalities are derived from the redistribution of 'unspecified stroke' and 'hypertension' with marked regional differences. Future advancements in stroke certification  data collections and statistical analyses may improve the estimation of the global stroke burden.
Stroke Rehabilitation,,,ExStroke Pilot Trial of the effect of repeated instructions to improve physical activity after ischaemic stroke: a multinational randomised controlled clinical trial. To investigate if repeated verbal instructions about physical activity to patients with ischaemic stroke could increase long term physical activity. Multicentre  multinational  randomised clinical trial with masked outcome assessment. Stroke units in Denmark  China  Poland  and Estonia. 314 patients with ischaemic stroke aged >or=40 years who were able to walk-157 (mean age 69.7 years) randomised to the intervention  157 (mean age 69.4 years) in the control group. Patients randomised to the intervention were instructed in a detailed training programme before discharge and at five follow-up visits during 24 months. Control patients had follow-up visits with the same frequency but without instructions in physical activity. Physical activity assessed with the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) at each visit. Secondary outcomes were clinical events. The estimated mean PASE scores were 69.1 in the intervention group and 64.0 in the control group (difference 5.0 (95% confidence interval -5.8 to 15.9)  P=0.36. The intervention had no significant effect on mortality  recurrent stroke  myocardial infarction  or falls and fractures. Repeated encouragement and verbal instruction in being physically active did not lead to a significant increase in physical activity measured by the PASE score. More intensive strategies seem to be needed to promote physical activity after ischaemic stroke. Clinical Trials NCT00132483.
Physical Therapy Specialty,,,The ExStroke Pilot Trial: rationale  design  and baseline data of a randomized multicenter trial comparing physical training versus usual care after an ischemic stroke. A high level of physical activity is associated with a decreased risk of first stroke and physical activity modifies recognized stroke risk factors and is recommended for stroke survivors. Available research shows that stroke patients can increase their level of physical performance over a short period. When the intervention period is over  physical performance often declines towards baseline level. Currently  there is no evidence on the association between physical activity and the risk of recurrent stroke. The ExStroke Pilot Trial is a randomized clinical trial with the aim of increasing stroke patients' level of physical activity and secondarily to associate the level of physical activity to the risk of recurrent stroke  myocardial infarction  and all-cause mortality in the two groups. We describe the rationale  design  and baseline data of the ExStroke Pilot Trial. Patients with ischemic stroke above 39 years were randomized to intervention or control group. The intervention group will  over a 2-year period  receive information on and verbal instruction to exercise by a physiotherapist or a physician. The control group will receive the department's usual care. Physical activity is assessed in both groups seven times during follow-up using the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) questionnaire  which quantifies the amount of physical activity done in the last seven days prior to interview. The PASE score constitutes the primary outcome measure. The secondary outcome is the time from randomization to recurrent stroke  myocardial infarction  or all-cause mortality. Further outcome measures include: time from randomization to recurrent stroke  myocardial infarction  and vascular death; recurrent stroke; modified Rankin Scale; quality of life; occurrence of falls and fractures. From 9 centers in 4 countries  314 patients were included and follow-up is ongoing. Mean age and standard deviation (SD) of the study participants was 68.4 (11.9) years and 56.4% were male. Mean (SD) PASE score was 84.1 (55.9) and median (interquartile range) Scandinavian Stroke Scale score was 54 (51-58).
Epidemiology,,,Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances and measures of human fertility: a systematic review. Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are found widespread in the environment and humans. The relation of PFASs to fertility has now been examined in a relatively large number of epidemiologic studies and a synthesis is in order. The aim of this study was to assess the current human epidemiologic evidence on the association between exposure to PFASs and measures of human fertility  with particular emphasis on perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA). Systematic literature searches were initially conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE and subsequently in references and citations of included papers. Studies were included if they assessed exposure to PFASs in biological samples in relation to reproductive hormones  semen characteristics  or time to pregnancy (TTP). Study characteristics and results were abstracted to predefined forms  and the studies were assessed for the risk of bias and confounding. Sixteen studies investigated the association between PFAS exposure in men and semen parameters  reproductive hormone levels  or TTP. There was a lack of consistent results among the numerous investigated exposure-outcome combinations. However  subtle associations between higher PFOS and lower testosterone or abnormal semen morphology cannot be excluded. Eleven studies assessed the association between PFAS exposure in women and TTP or reproductive hormones levels. Four of eight studies found prolonged TTP with higher PFOS or PFOA  but only one study found an association when restricting to nulliparous women. In men  there is little evidence of an association between PFAS exposure and semen quality or levels of reproductive hormones. For PFOS and PFOA  the literature indicates an association with female fecundability in parous women  which is most likely not causal.
Global Health,,,Pregnancy: occupational aspects of management: concise guidance. Most pregnant women are exposed to some physical activity at work. This Concise Guidance is aimed at doctors advising healthy women with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies about the risks arising from five common workplace exposures (prolonged working hours  shift work  lifting  standing and heavy physical workload). The adverse outcomes considered are: miscarriage  preterm delivery  small for gestational age  low birth weight  pre-eclampsia and gestational hypertension. Systematic review of the literature indicates that these exposures are unlikely to carry much of an increased risk for any of the outcomes  since small apparent effects might be explicable in terms of chance  bias  or confounding  while larger and better studies yield lower estimated risks compared with smaller and weaker studies. In general  patients can be reassured that such work is associated with little  if any  adverse effect on pregnancy. Moreover  moderate physical exercise is thought to be healthy in pregnancy and most pregnant women undertake some physical work at home. The guidelines provide risk estimates and advice on counselling.
Anesthesiology,,,Danish national sedation strategy. Targeted therapy of discomfort associated with critical illness. Danish Society of Intensive Care Medicine (DSIT) and the Danish Society of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (DASAIM). Sedation of critically ill patients undergoing mechanical ventilation should be minimized or completely avoided. Only in selected situations is sedation indicated as first line therapy (increased intracranial pressure or therapeutic hypothermia). The critical care physicians primary objective should be to focus on the reversible causes of agitation  such as: pain  anxiety  delirium  dyspnea  withdrawal symptoms  sleep or gastrointestinal symptoms. If sedation is used a validated sedation scale is recommended. On a daily basis sedation should be interrupted and only restarted after a thorough search for reversible causes of discomfort and stress.
Global Health,,,Death from the Nile crosses the Atlantic: the West Nile Fever story. The present paper reviews the American epidemic of West Nile Fever (WNF)  which is the largest recorded outbreak ever. The epidemiological consequences of introducing a novel and immunologically unknown pathogen in a previously unexposed population and the possible evolution of a more pathogenic viral strain are discussed. In view of recent reports of imported cases in Denmark the issue of possible disease spread to Scandinavia is likewise addressed. However  the main scope of the article is to provide the clinician with an overview of the natural history  epidemiology and clinical characteristics of the disease.
General Practice,,,[Reasons for removal of intrauterine devices among women in general practice]. Prolonged bleeding or spotting and pain are the most common reasons for women to request early removal of intrauterine device (IUD). We wanted to investigate which parameters influenced the removal of IUDs among women in general practice and to see if there was a difference between copper-releasing IUDs and levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs. In general the women were satisfied with both types of IUDs. More women with copper-releasing IUDs had an early removal because of complaints than women with levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs.
Travel Medicine,,,Travelling with HIV: a cross sectional analysis of Danish HIV-infected patients. We aimed to describe travel patterns  extent of professional pre-travel advice and health problems encountered during travel among HIV-infected individuals. During a six-month period a questionnaire was handed out to 2821 adult HIV-infected individuals attending any of the eight Danish medical HIV care centers. A total of 763 individuals responded. During the previous two years 49% had travelled outside Europe; 18% had travelled less and 30% were more cautious when choosing travel destination than before the HIV diagnosis. Pre-travel advice was sought by only 38%  and travel insurance was taken out by 86%. However  29%/74% did not inform the advisor/the insurance company about their HIV status. Nearly all patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) were adherent  but 58% worried about carrying HIV-medicine and 19% tried to hide it. Only 19% experienced health problems during travel  6% sought medical assistance and 0.5% was hospitalized. Danish HIV-infected patients travel frequently outside Denmark. Health and adherence to HAART were not major problems during travel. The main problems were failure to seek pre-travel advice  lack of disclosure of HIV status when seeking pre-travel advice or getting a travel insurance.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Allergy and asthma prevention 2014. Asthma and allergic diseases have become one of the epidemics of the 21st century in developed countries. Much of the success of other areas of medicine  such as infectious diseases  lies on preventive measures. Thus  much effort is also being placed lately in the prevention of asthma and allergy. This manuscript reviews the current evidence  divided into four areas of activity. Interventions modifying environmental exposure to allergens have provided inconsistent results  with multifaceted interventions being more effective in the prevention of asthma. Regarding nutrition  the use of hydrolyzed formulas in high-risk infants reduces the incidence of atopic dermatitis  while there is for now not enough evidence to recommend other dietary modifications  prebiotics  probiotics  or other microbial products. Pharmacologic agents used until now for prevention have not proved useful  while there is hope that antiviral vaccines could be useful in the future. Allergen-specific immunotherapy is effective for the treatment of allergic patients with symptoms; the study of its value for primary and secondary prevention of asthma and allergy is in its very preliminary phases. The lack of success in the prevention of these disorders lies on their complexity  which involves many genetic  epigenetic  and environmental interactions. There is a need to identify target populations  involved mechanisms and interactions  and the best interventions. These must be effective  feasible  implementable  and affordable.
Allergy and Immunology,Pediatrics,,The history of pediatric allergy in Europe - from a working group to ESPACI and SP-EAACI. A Working Group on Pediatric Allergology was formed in 1984  which rapidly developed to become the European Society on Pediatric Allergology and Clinical Immunology (ESPACI) in 1988 with its own journal  Pediatric Allergology and Immunology. ESPACI worked together with the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) to form a Section of Pediatrics within EAACI (SP-EAACI) in 1996. The ESPACI and the SP-EAACI formally merged in 2001. Within the EAACI organization  the Pediatric Section has continued to grow. The Pediatric Section is working to develop pediatric allergology across Europe  focusing on postgraduate education  facilitating the research agenda and advocating for children and adolescents with allergies.
Evidence-Based Medicine,General Practice,,Increasing the general level of academic capacity in general practice: introducing mandatory research training for general practitioner trainees through a participatory research process. To obtain good quality evidence-based clinical work there needs to be a culture of critical appraisal  and strong bridges between the clinical and the academic worlds in general practice. The aim was to educate the general practitioner (GP) trainees to obtain critical appraisal skills  and through the development and implementation of the mandatory programme to gradually empower the GP community to achieve academic capacity by creating a link between the GP researchers and the GP training community. This was done by developing a faculty  giving teaching skills to GP academics  and research skills to GP clinicians; and creating an awareness of the potential benefits of critical appraisal in training GP surgeries. Development and implementation of a faculty and a programme through a participatory action research-inspired project  with process evaluation from the beginning of the planning phase. From 2006 to 2009  we built a teaching faculty of 25 teachers among clinical GPs and GP academics; developed the training programme; and delivered the programme to 95 GP trainees. Some of the GP trainees later showed an interest in more substantial research projects  and GP trainers with no previous association with the research environment started to show an interest through their function as GP trainers. The GP academics of the faculty  however  felt that it was difficult to continue the engagement because of the still increasing demand for published knowledge production in academia. It is possible to support the development of general academic capacity in general practice using participatory design in collaboration with GP academics and clinicians  building bridges between academia and clinical work  as well as within academia between research publication and teaching. There is  however  a generic barrier in the regulation of academia itself.
General Practice,,,[The quality of susceptibility examinations of urine in general practice is generally good]. In Denmark  many microbiological tests (microscopy  culture and susceptibility examinations) are done in general practice for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections (UTI). In 2006  the costs of susceptibility examinations were 28 million DKK. Some regional health authorities have established a program for quality assessment. National quality requirements for susceptibility examinations have already been established. The clinical microbiological departments send simulated urines with bacteria of common UTI strains. The specimens are examined in general practice with routine methods. The results for a two-year period of susceptibility examinations are reported. Generally  the quality criteria were met.
Radiology,Rheumatology,,EFSUMB COMPASS for Rheumatologists dissemination and implementation--an international survey. The European Federation of Societies for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (EFSUMB) competency assessment (COMPASS) for rheumatologists performing musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSUS) was developed and published 2 years ago. It consists of a 3 level competency system. The objective of this study was to evaluate how the EFSUMB COMPASS has been disseminated and implemented and to assess the potential obstacles encountered. A questionnaire was developed and distributed by e-mail to all rheumatologists certified as EFSUMB level 3. Seventeen (85%) rheumatologists considered that the EFSUMB COMPASS is useful for training MSUS. The majority of them (17; 85%) had informed their colleagues or national rheumatology societies about the EFSUMB COMPASS. The most common obstacle encountered for the implementation of the COMPASS was the lack of time for supervision of the trainees (9; 45%). A total of 83 rheumatologists had been trained and assessed for competency in the three EFSUMB levels. This survey highlights the current status of EFSUMB COMPASS implementation in European countries with an expected increased number of rheumatologists being able to train and assess new trainees. Still  more efforts should be done for a higher implementation of EFSUMB COMPASS across European countries.
Pharmacogenetics,,,Treatment response and colonic gene expression in patients with Crohn's disease. Responses and adverse events to medication vary greatly among patients with Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to investigate whether global gene expression profiles could predict such responses and possible side effects. Tissue specimens from the descending colon were obtained from 32 CD patients (in 18 patients from areas without inflammation and in 14 patients from inflamed areas). Gene profiling was done using the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip array. Hybridization data were analyzed with dChip software. There were no differentially expressed genes between six patients who responded well to azathioprine and four who did not. No differences were found between 12 patients with adverse events to azathioprine and 9 patients who tolerated this drug. Sixteen patients who were not glucocorticoid-dependent had no differentially expressed genes as compared with 15 glucocorticoid-dependent patients. Six patients who responded well to infliximab had only one differentially expressed gene as compared to four patients who did not. DNA microarray analyses did not show differentially expressed genetic profiles from colonic mucosal cells obtained from groups of patients classified according to therapeutic criteria.
Family Practice,,,[Osteoporosis prevention in general practice after hospitalization for hip fracture]. The aim of the study was to assess: 1) the degree of osteoporosis preventative therapy initiated by general practitioners (GP) after hospitalisation for a hip fracture; 2) the GPs' opinion of osteoporosis preventative therapy  and their opinion on whether it should be initiated by the hospital or the GP; 3) the need for a reference programme. The GPs of patients discharged after a hip fracture in 1997-1998  were sent two questionnaires: one concerning osteoporosis preventative therapy of the patient and one concerning the GPs' own opinion on prevention. A total of 107 patients (80% women  20% men) met the criteria of the study. Eighty-seven per cent were seen by their GP within six months of discharge  16% were started on preventative therapy  which was: 53% calcium/calcium + vitamin D  40% etidronate  and 27% estrogen. No one chose alendronate  raloxifen  or hip protector. Eighty-four per cent were not treated  of these 18% did not want to be treated  poor patient compliance was expected in 11%  and 6% of the GPs did not find the scientific documentation convincing. Four per cent had been referred for a bone scan  and 2% to X-ray of the vertebral column. Of the GPs  52% felt it should be the patients' own GP who started the therapy  48% felt it should be the discharging hospital physician  83% felt they were capable of treating this condition. Sixty-nine per cent of the GPs felt a need for a reference programme  96% wished to have access to refer patients for a bone scan. Only 16% were started on osteoporosis preventative therapy after a hip fracture. The study shows a need for better co-operation and communication between hospital physicians and GPs  and a need for a reference programme.
Family Practice,,,Perspectives on lifestyle intervention: the views of general practitioners who have taken part in a health promotion study. A study was carried out to discover the views of Danish general practitioners on the possibility of intervening in their patients' lifestyles in general and on the obstacles to doing so  based on their experience of participating in a health promotion study. A focus group interview was conducted with five general practitioners who had participated in "The Ebeltoft Health Promotion Study" to assess their views on their preventive role. The general practitioners have internalized the view advanced by society and the medical profession that they have an important role to play in preventing lifestyle-related illness. However  they are sceptical about the effectiveness of intervention and have ethical concerns about giving lifestyle advice. They are also somewhat irritated by the fact that patients are chiefly interested in having their health checked  rather than in following up by changing their behaviour. The general practitioners differ in their views as to when  and how actively  they should initiate discussions with individual patients to encourage them to change their lifestyles. If the medical profession and those responsible for overall health policy wish to make general practitioners change their behaviour towards their patients  it is important that they understand the aims  values  and working conditions of general practitioners that underlie their present attitudes and behaviour.
Evidence-Based Medicine,Family Practice,,[Outpatient treatment. What is the evidence?]. In relation to the development of quality standards for the national quality development study  DGMA  a search was made through the literature on outpatient care. The literature was scanty  but some evidence was found on the following: Continuity of care is a patient demand  and several studies show more effective and less expensive treatment when this is ensured. Two studies show impaired quality of treatment  but quality is not defined either precisely or uniformly. Waiting times dissatisfy patients and perhaps diminish the result of treatment and information. Failure to turn up for appointments affects up to 29 per cent of consultations. Non-attendances could be cut down if patient factors and continuity of care are taken into account. Some outpatient consultations could take place in the general practitioner's surgery  if hospital doctors knew more about their capabilities.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[No evidence that diet has any influence on the aetiology of rheumatoid arthritis]. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease affecting 0 5-1% of the population. Several genetic and environmental factors are implicated in the aetiology of RA. The only well-established environmental risk factor is tobacco smoking. In this review we examine data linking intake of fatty acids  meat  antioxidants and vitamin D with the risk of RA. Although there is some tendency to show a protective effect of fatty acids from fish on RA  generally  evidence on dietary risk factors is scarce with a lack of statistical significance and reproducibility.
Aerospace Medicine,,,Sinus barotrauma--late diagnosis and treatment with computer-aided endoscopic surgery. Sinus barotrauma is usually easy to diagnose  and treatment achieves good results. We present two severe cases where delayed diagnosis caused significant morbidity. The signs and symptoms were atypical and neither the patients themselves  nor the initial examiners recognized that the onset of symptoms coincided with descent in a commercial airliner. CT and MRI scans of the brain were normal  but in both cases showed opafication of the sphenoid sinuses  which lead to the correct diagnosis. Subsequent surgical intervention consisting of endoscopic computer-aided surgery showed blood and petechia in the affected sinuses. This procedure provided immediate relief.
Pediatrics,Urology,,The standardization of terminology of lower urinary tract function in children and adolescents: Update report from the standardization committee of the International Children's Continence Society. The impact of the original International Children's Continence Society (ICCS) terminology document on lower urinary tract (LUT) function resulted in the global establishment of uniformity and clarity in the characterization of LUT function and dysfunction in children across multiple healthcare disciplines. The present document serves as a stand-alone terminology update reflecting refinement and current advancement of knowledge on pediatric LUT function. A variety of worldwide experts from multiple disciplines within the ICCS leadership who care for children with LUT dysfunction were assembled as part of the standardization committee. A critical review of the previous ICCS terminology document and the current literature was performed. Additionally  contributions and feedback from the multidisciplinary ICCS membership were solicited. Following a review of the literature over the last 7 years  the ICCS experts assembled a new terminology document reflecting current understanding of bladder function and LUT dysfunction in children using the resources from the literature review  expert opinion and ICCS member feedback. The present ICCS terminology document provides a current and consensus update to the evolving terminology and understanding of LUT function in children. Neurourol.

Stroke Rehabilitation,,,Safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment in recovering stroke patients. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used for psychiatric complications after stroke. Studies have indicated additional effects  and SSRIs could potentially be used as enhancers of stroke recovery. However  beneficial effects should be weighed against potential adverse effects. In particular  the possible association with cerebrovascular events has raised concern. We review the literature on cerebrovascular events associated with SSRI treatment after stroke. The possible beneficial effects of SSRI treatment for stroke recovery and survival  and potential safety concerns  are discussed. Evidence suggests that SSRIs may enhance stroke recovery. Most studies on cerebrovascular risk are from non-stroke populations and little is known about recurrent events and mortality post-stroke. In non-stroke populations treatment has been associated with increased risk of intracerebral and intracranial hemorrhage; however the absolute risk is low. The association between SSRIs and ischemic stroke is less clear. Randomized stroke trials indicate that treatment is safe and well tolerated  and the most common side effects are often benign and transient. The trials are small however and not powered to detect potential differences in cerebrovascular events. We await several ongoing large randomized trials before SSRIs can be recommended as a routine pharmacotherapy in stroke recovery.
Telemedicine,,,Early telemedicine training and counselling after hospitalization in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a feasibility study. An essential element in the treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is rehabilitation  of which supervised training is an important part. However  not all individuals with severe COPD can participate in the rehabilitation provided by hospitals and municipal training centres due to distance to the training venues and transportation difficulties. The aim of the study was to assess the feasibility of an individualized home-based training and counselling programme via video conference to patients with severe COPD after hospitalization including assessment of safety  clinical outcomes  patients' perceptions  organisational aspects and economic aspects. The design was a pre- and post-test intervention study. Fifty patients with severe COPD were included. The telemedicine training and counselling included three weekly supervised exercise sessions by a physiotherapist and up to two supervised counselling and training sessions in energy conservation techniques by an occupational therapist. The telemedicine videoconferencing equipment was a computer containing a screen  a microphone  an on/off switch and a volume control. Thirty seven (74%) participants completed the programme  with improvements in health status assessed by the Clinical COPD Questionnaire and physical performance assessed by a sit-to-stand test and a timed-up-and-go test. There were no cases of patient fall or emergency contact with a general practitioner during the telemedicine training sessions. The study participants believed the telemedicine training and counselling was essential for getting started with being physically active in a secure manner. The business case showed that under the current financing system  the reimbursement to the hospital was slightly higher than the hospital expenditures. Thus  the business case for the hospital was positive. The organizational analysis indicated that the perceptions of the staff were that the telemedicine service had improved the continuity of the rehabilitation programme for the patients and enabled the patients' everyday lives to be included in the treatment. This study showed that home-based supervised training and counselling via video conference is safe and feasible and that telemedicine can help to ensure more equitable access to supervised training in patients with severe COPD.

Veterinary Medicine,,,The analysis--hierarchical models: past  present and future. This paper discusses statistical modelling for data with a hierarchical structure  and distinguishes in this context between three different meanings of the term hierarchical model: to account for clustering  to investigate variability and separate predictive equations at different hierarchical levels (multi-level analysis)  and in a Bayesian framework to involve multiple layers of data or prior information. Within each of these areas  the paper reviews both past developments and the present state  and offers indications of future directions. In a worked example  previously reported data on piglet lameness are reanalyzed with multi-level methodology for survival analysis  leading to new insights into the data structure and predictor effects. In our view  hierarchical models of all three types discussed have much to offer for data analysis in veterinary epidemiology and other disciplines.
Veterinary Medicine,,,Standards for reporting surveillance information in freedom from infection models by example of Trichinella in Canadian market hogs. Freedom from infection modeling  using scenario trees  has become an established methodology and is well described in the literature. However  standards for organizing and reporting the surveillance information incorporated into such models are less developed. Canada has been routinely testing for Trichinella spiralis in market hogs in federally inspected slaughter plants since the late 1990s. By way of presenting our work on T. spiralis in Canadian hogs  we propose that information in surveillance models be organized in distinct categories  each with specific parameters and values that are thoroughly described and justified. The proposed categories are: (1) definitions for the objectives  (2) initial time period  (3) inputs  (4) data  (5) model settings  (6) outputs  and (7) validation. Having a standardized manner of reporting such studies will facilitate their validation and expedite their evaluation by experts in the field and their use in trade negotiations.
Pediatrics,,,Applicability and intrarespondent reliability of the pediatric evaluation of disability inventory in a random Danish sample. To examine the applicability of US reference data from the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI) in a random Danish sample and to assess intrarespondent reliability. The PEDI was administered as a mailed questionnaire that was completed by the parents. Linear regression models and comparisons of item difficulty were performed in the data analysis. Intraclass correlation coefficients were used in the intrarespondent analysis. US and Danish children differed on 3 of the 6 subscales of the PEDI. Danish children had significantly lower scores on the caregiver assistance subscales (self-care and mobility) and significantly higher scores on the functional skills subscale (social function). Item difficulty was found to be comparable (r = 0.82-0.97) on all 6 subscales. Intrarespondent reliability was good (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.62-0.97). The PEDI reference values seem partly applicable in a Danish population. In a Danish rehabilitation setting  interpreting PEDI scores with regard to detecting functional delays must be done cautiously.
Occupational Medicine,,,Exposure assessment for retrospective follow-up studies of semiconductor- and storage device-manufacturing workers. This exposure assessment was conducted in the first large study of mortality and cancer incidence in semiconductor and storage device manufacturing. Unique combinations of division  department and job codes and names (DDJ) from work history records were assigned to work groups and exposure categories. Agent exposure matrices assessed differences in potential exposures between groups. Changes in exposure over time were tracked by dividing the production history into manufacturing eras. Nineteen work groups were developed to capture 310 351 unique DDJs from 1965-1999. Agent exposure matrices contrasted exposure potential to solvents  metals  and work in cleanrooms between groups  and three manufacturing eras were identified for each site. The work groups  manufacturing eras and agent matrices have been used to classify workers in the study of cancer incidence and mortality.
Epidemiology,,,Potential exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals and selected adverse pregnancy outcomes: a follow-up study of pregnant women referred for occupational counselling. Experimental evidence indicates that fetal exposure to xenobiotics with the potential to interfere with the endogenous steroid hormone regulation of fetal development may reduce birth weight. However  epidemiological studies are limited. The aim of the study was to investigate whether potential occupational exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC) of the mother during pregnancy is associated with preterm birth and low birth weight. Pregnant women referred to an Occupational Health Clinic (OHC) in two Danish regions (Copenhagen or Aarhus) between 1984 and 2010  suspected of being exposed to occupational reproductive hazards were included in the study. A job exposure matrix enabled estimation of potential occupational exposure to EDC on the basis of job title. Births by women potentially exposed to EDC (n = 582) were compared to births by women referred to an OHC on the suspicion of other exposures than EDC (n = 620)  and to a sample of births by all occupationally active women in the same geographical regions (n = 346 544)  including 1 077 births of the referred women's non-referred pregnancies. No indications of reduced birth weight or increased risk of preterm birth were found among women potentially exposed to EDC. Women potentially exposed to EDC had children with a higher birth weight compared to the sample of occupationally active women but not compared to other women referred to an OHC. Potential maternal exposure to EDC at Danish workplaces is not related to low birth weight or preterm birth among women referred to occupational counselling. Occupational exposures might be too weak on the average to cause these adverse effects or counselling at the OHCs is effective in preventing them.
Epidemiology,,,Aquaporin-4-autoimmunity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: A predominantly population-based study. Serum immunoglobulin G targeting the astrocyte water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4) in the central nervous system (CNS) is a biomarker for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disease (NMOSD). Co-existence of NMOSD with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) putatively suggests susceptibility to antibody-mediated autoimmune disease. To estimate the prevalence of NMOSD in SLE and investigate the immunogenetic background for an association of NMOSD and SLE. The study included a predominantly population-based cohort with clinical and serological investigations of 208 patients with SLE  followed prospectively since 1995. All patients received immunosuppressive treatment. NMOSD was evaluated retrospectively based on the 2015 International Panel for NMOSD Diagnosis (IPND) criteria. Polymorphisms in programmed cell death protein 1 (PDCD-1) PD-1.3 G/A were genotyped. AGP4-IgG and other autoantibodies  including myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)  was determined blinded to clinical diagnosis. Of 208 patients with SLE  45(22%) had neuropsychiatric (NP) SLE  and CNS involvement predominated in 30 of 45 (67%) patients. Serum AQP4-IgG was detected in 2 of 30 (6.7%) neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE) patients both of whom had myelitis and antiphospholipid syndrome; one patient also had myasthenia gravis. None had MOG-IgG. PD-1.3A allele was not associated with SLE nor with NPSLE. AQP4-IgG autoimmune syndrome may rarely co-exist with SLE  and such patients have other NMOSD-typical syndromes such as myelitis.
Adolescent Psychiatry,Child Psychiatry,,Autism spectrum disorders. The revision of the diagnostic criteria for ASD has been widely anticipated and is expected to be an important contribution to the refinement of the definition of ASD. In the upcoming DSM-5  several changes have been made compared to the previous diagnostic criteria. They include no emphasis on language delay and age of onset except that ASD is defined as a neurodevelopmental disorder with symptoms in early childhood although the disorder may first be diagnosed later in life. The three areas of impairments in ASD are reduced to two areas  namely a social-communication domain and a behavioral domain including fixated interests and repetitive behaviors. In addition  the clinical presentation of ASD in the individual is described in more detail in terms of clinical specifiers. In addition to reporting these changes in the classification  the major international guidelines are introduced and a brief description of good clinical practice of assessment and the overall principles of intervention is provided.

Epidemiology,,,Individual courses of low back pain in adult Danes: a cohort study with 4-year and 8-year follow-up. Few longitudinal studies have described the variation in LBP and its impact over time at an individual level. The aims of this study were to: 1) determine the prevalence of LBP in three surveys over a 9-year period in the Danish general population  using five different definitions of LBP  2) study their individual long-term courses  and 3) determine the odds of reporting subsequent LBP when having reported previous LBP. A cohort of 625 men and women aged 40 was sampled from the general population. Questions about LBP were asked at ages 41  45 and 49  enabling individual courses to be tracked across five different definitions of LBP. Results were reported as percentages and the prognostic influence on future LBP was reported as odds ratios (OR). Questionnaires were completed by 412 (66%)  348 (56%) and 293 (47%) persons respectively at each survey. Of these  293 (47%) completed all three surveys. The prevalence of LBP did not change significantly over time for any LBP past year: 69  68  70%; any LBP past month: 42  48  41%; >30 days LBP past year: 25  27  24%; seeking care for LBP past year: 28  30  36%; and non-trivial LBP  i.e. LBP >30 days past year including consequences: 18  20  20%. For LBP past year  2/3 remained in this category  whereas four out of ten remained over the three time-points for the other definitions of LBP. Reporting LBP defined in any of these ways significantly increased the odds for the same type of LBP 4 years later. For those with the same definition of LBP at both 41 and 45 years  the risk of also reporting the same at 49 years was even higher  regardless of definition  and most strongly for seeking care and non-trivial LBP (OR 17.6 and 18.4) but less than 11% were in these groups. The prevalence rates of LBP  when defined in a number of ways  were constant over time at a group level  but did not necessarily involve the same individuals. Reporting more severe LBP indicated a higher risk of also reporting future LBP but less than 11% were in these categories at each survey.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Spinal manipulation for chronic low back pain--a survey of a chronic review]. A new Cochrane review based on 26 studies - 18 new since the last Cochrane review from 2003 - on spinal manipulation for chronic low back pain has been published by Rubinstein et al. Generally  manipulation for these patients was not clinically relevant better than other treatments like e.g. physical training. In general  the widespread use of manipulation should be reduced. The issues of specific subgroups with possible relevance/irrelevance of such treatment to obtain short-lasting pain relief in selected cases are discussed.
Thoracic Surgery,,,Cardiac surgery fast-track treatment in a postanesthetic care unit: six-month results of the Leipzig fast-track concept. The authors compared the safety and efficacy of a newly developed fast-track concept at their center  including implementation of a direct admission postanesthetic care unit  to standard perioperative management. All fast-track patients treated within the first 6 months of implementation of our direct admission postanesthetic care unit were matched via propensity scores and compared with a historical control group of patients who underwent cardiac surgery prior to fast-track implementation. A total of 421 fast-track patients were matched successfully to 421 control patients. The two groups of patients had a similar age (64 +/- 13 vs. 64 +/- 12 yr for fast-track vs. control  P = 0.45) and European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation-predicted risk of mortality (4.8 +/- 6.1% vs. 4.6 +/- 5.1%  P = 0.97). Fast-track patients had significantly shorter times to extubation (75 min [45-110] vs. 900 min [600-1140])  as well as shorter lengths of stay in the postanesthetic or intensive care unit (4 h [3.0-5] vs. 20 h [16-25])  intermediate care unit (21 h [17-39] vs. 26 h [19-49])  and hospital (10 days [8-12] vs. 11 days [9-14]) (expressed as median and interquartile range  all P < 0.01). Fast-track patients also had a lower risk of postoperative low cardiac output syndrome (0.5% vs. 2.9%  P < 0.05) and mortality (0.5% vs. 3.3%  P < 0.01). The Leipzig fast-track protocol is a safe and effective method to manage cardiac surgery patients after a variety of operations.
Otolaryngology,,,Systematic analysis of ear-nose-throat malpractice complaints may be beneficial for patient safety. The analysis of malpractice complaints can provide valuable information on patient safety. This study offers a detailed examination of the backgrounds concerning reasons and outcomes of ear  nose and throat (ENT) malpractice complaints handled by the National Board of Patients' Complaints (NBPC)  1998-2008. All NBPC decisions related to the ENT specialty from 1998-2008 in Denmark were analysed. Deficient medical recording was criticized even though the complainant did not mention this in the complaint. The juridical theme of medical error was the most complained about  but the least criticized compared with six other juridical themes. In contrast  retained packaging  wrong-site surgery  laser burns and peeling injuries were medical errors with high rates of criticism. Complaints concerning accidental surgical complications did not lead to criticism. Tonsillectomy was the most frequently alleged ENT operation in our study data. Thorough preoperative information about potential surgical complications undersigned by the patient and the newly introduced safe surgery procedures are likely to reduce both faults and complaints. Malpractice complaints have not hitherto been used as a learning instrument. We propose a systematic registration of these incidents to enable more learning in the future. The new act on the handling of malpractice complaints may make it easier to avoid malpractice and to learn from malpractice complaints and may thus improve patient safety in Denmark. not relevant. not relevant.
Otolaryngology,,,Increased number of ear-nose-throat malpractice complaints in Denmark. Danish ear  nose and throat (ENT) physicians have little knowledge of the type of decisions made at the Danish National Board of Patients' Complaints (NBPC). The aim of this study was to analyze and describe the epidemiology of ENT malpractice complaints by showing their distribution and volume in order to facilitate learning and evaluate the underlying factors. This retrospective register study analyzed all ENT malpractice complaints processed by the NBPC in the 1998-2008 period. In 18% of the 480 ENT malpractice complaints  the settlement resulted in criticism of one or more ENT health-care professionals. A steady increase in the number of ENT malpractice complaints was found over the study period and the total increase observed for the study period was 72%. Younger generations of ENT patients complained more and those older than 70 years complained less than the respective age groups of ENT patients treated at public hospitals. The mean incidence of ENT malpractice complaints was lowest in the Northern Jutland Region and highest in the Capital Region which was the most densely populated region. ENT departments at public hospitals receive complaints six times more frequently than ENT practicing clinics  even though the latter handle more patient contacts. The numbers of complaints and criticisms per specialist physicians at public hospitals were almost identical to those of specialist physicians serving at ENT practicing clinics. An increasing trend in the number of the ENT malpractice complaints was found in the 1998-2008 period. not relevant. not relevant.
Epidemiology,,,Lack of evidence of increased risk of bacterial transmission during cystic fibrosis educational programmes. Educational and rehabilitation programmes increase the quality-of-life of patients with cystic fibrosis  but patients are discouraged to participate because of the risk of cross-infections. Isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa  Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae cultured one year before to one year after attendance were investigated by pulsed field gel electrophoresis  multilocus sequence typing and/or spa-typing. We typed 984 bacterial isolates cultured from 46 patients aged 5-18 years attending educational programmes at Aarhus University Hospital during 2009-2011. There were no cross-infections with P. aeruginosa. Six cases of S. aureus or H. influenzae strain replacement with a new strain-type shared with a fellow attendee were found. However  the probability of acquiring a shared strain of S. aureus or H. influenzae was not increased for patients attending educational programmes. Transmission of P. aeruginosa  S. aureus and H. influenzae related to attendance to the investigated educational programmes could not be documented.
General Practice,,,Use of lung function tests in asthmatic children is associated with lower risk of hospitalization. A Danish population-based follow-up study. Asthma is the most common chronic disease in childhood. Large variations in hospitalization rates are observed and adherence to and appropriateness of guidelines are often subject of discussion. The aim was to examine if adherence to guidelines concerning use of lung function tests at time of diagnosis and during the first year after the start of medical treatment was associated with risk of hospitalization. A Danish nationwide population-based cohort study was performed for the study period 1999-2004 using data from five nationwide registries linked by a unique personal registration number. Risk of hospitalization was examined in relation to whether asthmatic children aged 6-14 had a lung function test at the start of treatment and during the first year of follow-up and a medication ratio of controller-to-total medication of at least 0.5. Cox regression analysis was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted for sex  age  socioeconomic factors  care provider  and severity of disease. A total of 27 193 asthmatic children were followed for at least 1 year after the start of medication. The adjusted HR for hospitalization was 0.64 (95% confidence interval: 0.55-0.74) for having had a lung function test at the start of treatment; 0.82 (0.68-1.00) for having had a lung function test during the first 6 months of follow-up; 0.67 (0.55-0.81) for having a medication ratio of at least 0.5. Children from low-income families and children aged 6-8 had an increased risk of hospitalization. Adherence to the guidelines concerning use of lung function test for asthmatic children was associated with a reduced risk of hospitalization. Likewise  a medication ratio of controller-to-total medication of at least 0.5 was associated with a lower risk of hospitalization.
Military Medicine,,,Prevalence of myopia in Danish conscripts. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of myopia among Danish conscripts and compare the results with those from similar Danish studies carried out in 1882 and 1964. Furthermore  the relationships between myopia and educational level  ethnicity  intelligence (IQ)  body mass index (BMI) and height were analysed. We carried out a cross-sectional study based on medical reports for 4681 male conscripts. The following data were collected from September to December 2004: age; place of birth; weight; height; power of spectacles or contact lenses; visual acuity; number of years at school (8-13 years); occupation; intelligence test (IQ test) score  and ethnicity. The prevalence of myopia (<or= - 0.5 D  spherical equivalent) was 12.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]+/- 0.96); the prevalence of high myopia (< - 6.5 D) was 0.3% (95% CI +/- 0.15). Myopes scored higher (45.3 [SD 9.4]) on IQ tests than emmetropes (41.4 [SD 10.4]) (p < 0.001) and had a higher educational level. No relationship was found between myopia and BMI  height or ethnicity. The study reports a significantly decreasing prevalence of low myopia among Danish conscripts in 2004 compared with 1964. Compared with the results from the 1882 study  the prevalence of low myopia seems stable. The prevalence of high myopia has decreased significantly since 1882 and has also tended to decrease from 1964. Number of years in education and IQ test score were related to myopia.
Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine,,,Rates of lumbar disc surgery before and after implementation of multidisciplinary nonsurgical spine clinics. Correlation study. To assess the rates of lumbar disc surgery in North Jutland County  Denmark  before and after implementation of two nonsurgical spine clinics  and to compare the observed rates with those for the rest of Denmark in the same time periods. Few studies have addressed initiatives to reduce high rates of lumbar disc surgery by improving nonsurgical care offered to patients with sciatica and low back pain. The study was conducted in North Jutland County  Denmark with 500 000 inhabitants (10% of the Danish population). In 1997  two nonsurgical spine clinics were established  along with an educational program for general practitioners. The clinics targeted patients with sciatica of 1 to 3 months' duration  with or without low back pain. Data on rates of lumbar disc surgery were obtained from the National Registry of Patients. The annual rate of lumbar disc operations for patients in North Jutland County decreased from approximately 60 to 80 per 100 000 before 1997 to 40 per 100 000 in 2001 (P = 0.00)  and the rate of elective  first-time disc surgeries decreased by approximately two thirds (P = 0.00). In contrast  the annual rate of lumbar disc operations for patients in the rest of Denmark remained unchanged during the same period. The implementation of multidisciplinary  nonsurgical spine clinics coincided closely with a significant reduction in the rate of lumbar disc surgery. The observed reduction seems most likely to be causally associated with educational activities and improved patient care provided by the clinics.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Smoking--a risk factor for rheumatoid arthritis development]. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic disabling inflammatory joint disease of unknown aetiology. Genetic and environmental factors are implicated in its pathogenesis. We performed a literature search on MEDLINE  the Cochrane database and EMBASE on the interaction between smoking and RA. It is concluded that previous and current smoking constitute a risk factor for RA development. Smoking acts synergistically with other RA risk factors  including IgM-rheumatoid factor  anti-CCP and shared epitopes. The effect of smoking on the course of RA has not been described in sufficient detail.
Orthopedics,,,Introduction of new guidelines for emergency patients: motivational counselling among smokers. Smoking is the most important risk factor for morbidity and mortality in hospital patients. Patient contact with the healthcare system should include smoking cessation counselling. Emergency admissions are seldom given this opportunity. The aim of the study was to illustrate the implementation of motivational counselling in a department of acute surgery. Between May 2003 and January 2004  200 emergency patients were offered motivational counselling and a 6-week smoking cessation programme. We measured the number of patients who accepted motivational counselling. Of the initial 200 patients  121 (61%) accepted motivational counselling. The only factor related to the level of motivation was age. The most motivated group had an average age of 45 years  whereas the average age of the least motivated group was 64. There was no correlation between the Fagerstrom score  pack-years  gender  illness  employment  or alcohol consumption and the outcome. Fifty-seven patients agreed to us following them up  of which 10% quit smoking for 6 months; 44% either quit or reduced their smoking for a shorter period of time  and 17% of the continuing smokers requested admission to the smoking cessation programme. The majority of smokers acutely admitted to an acute orthopaedic department accepted motivational counselling against smoking  the youngest being the most motivated. It appears possible to implement motivational counselling for smoking cessation in an acute orthopaedic department. It is relevant to consider how  and for which groups  a smoking intervention programme can be offered to acutely admitted patients.
Gynecology,Oncology Nursing,,Gynecological cancer patients' differentiated use of help from a nurse navigator: a qualitative study. Fragmentation in healthcare can present challenges for patients with suspected cancer. It can add to existing anxiety  fear  despair and confusion during disease trajectory. In some circumstances patients are offered help from an extra contact person  a Nurse Navigator (NN). Scientific studies showing who will benefit from the extra help offered are missing. This study aims to explore who could benefit from the help on offer from a nurse appointed as NN in the early part of a cancer trajectory  and what would be meaningful experiences in this context. A longitudinal study with a basis in phenomenology and hermeneutics was performed among Danish women with gynecological cancer. Semi-structured interviews provided data for the analysis  and comprehensive understanding was arrived at by first adopting an open-minded approach to the transcripts and by working at three analytical levels. Prior experience of trust  guarded trust or distrust of physicians in advance of encountering the NN was of importance in determining whether or not to accept help from the NN. For those lacking trust in physicians and without a close relationship to a healthcare professional  the NN offered a new trusting relationship and they felt reassured by her help. Not everyone could use the help offered by the NN. This knowledge is vital both to healthcare practitioners and to administrators  who want to do their best for cancer patients but who are obliged to consider financial consequences. Moreover patients' guarded trust or distrust in physicians established prior to meeting the NN showed possible importance for choosing extra help from the NN. These findings suggest increased focus on patients' trust in healthcare professionals. How to find the most reliable method to identify those who can use the help is still a question for further debate and research.
Medical Illustration,,,'I can't relate it to teeth': a qualitative approach to evaluate oral health education materials for preschool children in New South Wales  Australia. Early Childhood Caries is a significant public health issue worldwide. Although much is known about the aetiology of dental caries  there is limited evidence on the understanding of caregivers on readily available early childhood oral health education materials. The purpose of this study was to record how parents cope with dental health education materials for preschool children commonly available in New South Wales  Australia. This qualitative study was nested within a large cohort study in South Western Sydney. English-speaking mothers (n = 24) with young children were approached for a face-to-face  semi-structured interview at their homes. Two dental leaflets designed by NSW Health to give advice on monitoring young children's oral health were sent to mothers prior to the interview. Interviews were recorded and subsequently transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were analysed by interview debriefing and a thematic coding. Mothers generally reported that the leaflets were easy to read but noted that the information pertaining to bottle feeding was confusing. Furthermore  they were unable to understand terms such as 'fluoride' and 'fissure sealants'. Early childhood nutrition and infant teething were inadequately addressed  and mothers preferred pictorial presentations to improve their understanding of oral health. Producers of health education leaflets should keep the messages simple and straightforward  avoid the use of medical jargon  and use pictorial aids to improve communication with parents.
School Dentistry,,,Age  period  and cohort analysis of regular dental care behavior and edentulism: a marginal approach. To analyze the regular dental care behavior and prevalence of edentulism in adult Danes  reported in sequential cross-sectional oral health surveys by the application of a marginal approach to consider the possible clustering effect of birth cohorts. Data from four sequential cross-sectional surveys of non-institutionalized Danes conducted from 1975-2005 comprising 4330 respondents aged 15+ years in 9 birth cohorts were analyzed. The key study variables were seeking dental care on an annual basis (ADC) and edentulism. For the analysis of ADC  survey year  age  gender  socio-economic status (SES) group  denture-wearing  and school dental care (SDC) during childhood were considered. For the analysis of edentulism  only respondents aged 35+ years were included. Survey year  age  gender  SES group  ADC  and SDC during childhood were considered as the independent factors. To take into account the clustering effect of birth cohorts  marginal logistic regressions with an independent correlation structure in generalized estimating equations (GEE) were carried out  with PROC GENMOD in SAS software. The overall proportion of people seeking ADC increased from 58.8% in 1975 to 86.7% in 2005  while for respondents aged 35 years or older  the overall prevalence of edentulism (35+ years) decreased from 36.4% in 1975 to 5.0% in 2005. Females  respondents in the higher SES group  in more recent survey years  with no denture  and receiving SDC in all grades during childhood were associated with higher probability of seeking ADC regularly (P < 0.05). The interaction of SDC and age (P<0.0001) was significant. The probabilities of seeking ADC were even higher among subjects with SDC in all grades and aged 45 years or older. Females  older age group  respondents in earlier survey years  not seeking ADC  lower SES group  and not receiving SDC in all grades were associated with higher probability of being edentulous (P<0.05). With the use of GEE  the potential clustering effect of birth cohorts in sequential cross-sectional oral health survey data could be appropriately considered. The success of Danish dental health policy was demonstrated by a continued increase of regular dental visiting habits and tooth retention in adults because school dental care was provided to Danes in their childhood.
Dentistry,,,Dental therapists: a global perspective. In 1921  New Zealand began training school dental nurses  subsequently deploying them throughout the country in school-based clinics providing basic dental care for children. The concept of training dental nurses  later to be designated dental therapists  was adopted by other countries as a means of improving access to care  particularly for children. This paper profiles six countries that utilise dental therapists  with a description of the training that therapists receive in these countries  and the context in which they practice. Based on available demographic information  it also updates the number of dental therapists practising globally  as well as the countries in which they practice. In several countries  dental therapy is now being integrated with dental hygiene in training and practice to create a new type of professional complementary to a dentist. Increasingly  dental therapists are permitted to treat adults as well as children. The paper also describes the status of a current initiative to introduce dental therapy to the United States. It concludes by suggesting that dental therapists can become valued members of the dental team throughout the world  helping to improve access to care and reducing existing disparities in oral health.
Precision Medicine,,,Personalized Clinical Decision Making in Gastrointestinal Malignancies: The Role of PET. Gastrointestinal malignancies comprise a heterogeneous group of diseases that include both common and rare diseases with very different presentations and prognoses. The mainstay of treatment is surgery in combination with preoperative and adjuvant chemotherapy depending on clinical presentation and initial stages. This article outlines the potential use of fluorodeoxyglucose-PET/CT in clinical decision making with special regard to preoperative evaluation and response assessment in gastric cancer (including the gastroesophageal junction)  pancreatic cancer (excluding neuroendocrine tumors)  colorectal cancer  and gastrointestinal stromal tumors.
General Practice,,,Validation of the 5-year tetanus  diphtheria  pertussis and polio booster vaccination in the Danish childhood vaccination database. In Denmark  data from the childhood vaccination database are used to calculate vaccination coverage (VC) for childhood vaccinations. However  there may be under-reporting in this database. Accurate VC estimates are necessary for adjusting vaccination strategies and providing population-level protection. The main purpose of this study was to validate the reporting of the tetanus  diphtheria  pertussis and polio (Tdap-IPV) booster in the childhood vaccination database  identify reasons a child was not vaccinated  for the unregistered vaccinations  identify where the vaccination was provided  and to adjust calculations of the VC accordingly. Children registered in the Danish Civil Registry System (residing legally in Denmark) from the 2000 to 2003 birth cohorts without a recorded Tdap-IPV booster in the childhood vaccination database were randomly selected for this cross-sectional  questionnaire-based study. The adjusted VC in the population was calculated by adding the fraction of the study population registered with the Tdap-IPV booster in the childhood vaccination database to the fraction of the study population who reported being vaccinated on the questionnaire but who were not register according to the childhood vaccination database. Of the 574 contacted parents  386 (67%) completed a questionnaire; 272 (70%) reported that their child received the Tdap-IPV booster  with 121 (44%) providing the date of vaccination. Most commonly reported reasons for not receiving the booster included forgetting (37%) and not wanting the vaccination (16%). The majority (89%) of children who received the booster were vaccinated by their general practitioners (GPs); 6% abroad and <1% in a hospital. Using a conservative approach  considering only those who used a vaccination card to answer the questionnaire and who provided an exact data of vaccination  the adjusted Tdap-IPV booster VC was 85.6% (95% CI  85.1-86.3%) compared to 82% from the childhood vaccination database. We identified substantial underreporting of the Tdap-IPV booster in the childhood vaccination database  mainly due to GPs not registering given vaccinations. Validating data used for VC calculations is needed to obtain more precise estimates.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[The effect of zinc therapy on common cold--a survey of a Cochrane review]. The Cochrane review "Zinc and the common cold" included 15 randomized controlled double-blind trials. It was concluded  that zinc would shorten the duration of the episode of common cold and also could be used as a prevention so that the risk of developing an episode of common cold would be decreased. It is too early to give general recommendations for the use of zinc as we do not have sufficient knowledge about the optimal dose  formulation and duration of treatment. Further research should focus on the effect of zinc in patients who are at increased risk of developing complications after common cold.
Public Health,,,Preventing neural tube defects in Europe: a missed opportunity. Each year  more than 4500 pregnancies in the European Union are affected by neural tube defects (NTD). Unambiguous evidence of the effectiveness of periconceptional folic acid in preventing the majority of neural tube defects has been available since 1991. We report on trends in the total prevalence of neural tube defects up to 2002  in the context of a survey in 18 European countries of periconceptional folic acid supplementation (PFAS) policies and their implementation. EUROCAT is a network of population-based registries in Europe collaborating in the epidemiological surveillance of congenital anomalies. Representatives from 18 participating countries provided information about policy  health education campaigns and surveys of PFAS uptake. The yearly total prevalence of neural tube defects including livebirths  stillbirths and terminations of pregnancy was calculated from 1980 to 2002 for 34 registries  with UK and Ireland estimated separately from the rest of Europe. A meta-analysis of changes in NTD total prevalence between 1989-1991 and 2000-2002 according to PFAS policy was undertaken for 24 registries. By 2005  13 countries had a government recommendation that women planning a pregnancy should take 0.4mg folic acid supplement daily  accompanied in 7 countries by government-led health education initiatives. In the UK and Ireland  countries with PFAS policy  there was a 30% decline in NTD total prevalence (95% CI 16-42%) but it was difficult to distinguish this from the pre-existing strong decline. In other European countries with PFAS policy  there was virtually no decline in NTD total prevalence whether a policy was in place by 1999 (2%  95% CI 28% reduction to 32% increase) or not (8%  95% CI 26% reduction to 16% increase). The potential for preventing NTDs by periconceptional folic acid supplementation is still far from being fulfilled in Europe. Only a public health policy including folic acid fortification of staple foods is likely to result in large-scale prevention of NTDs.
General Surgery,Gynecology,,Effect of virtual reality training on laparoscopic surgery: randomised controlled trial. To assess the effect of virtual reality training on an actual laparoscopic operation. Prospective randomised controlled and blinded trial. Seven gynaecological departments in the Zeeland region of Denmark. 24 first and second year registrars specialising in gynaecology and obstetrics. Proficiency based virtual reality simulator training in laparoscopic salpingectomy and standard clinical education (controls). The main outcome measure was technical performance assessed by two independent observers blinded to trainee and training status using a previously validated general and task specific rating scale. The secondary outcome measure was operation time in minutes. The simulator trained group (n=11) reached a median total score of 33 points (interquartile range 32-36 points)  equivalent to the experience gained after 20-50 laparoscopic procedures  whereas the control group (n=10) reached a median total score of 23 (22-27) points  equivalent to the experience gained from fewer than five procedures (P<0.001). The median total operation time in the simulator trained group was 12 minutes (interquartile range 10-14 minutes) and in the control group was 24 (20-29) minutes (P<0.001). The observers' inter-rater agreement was 0.79. Skills in laparoscopic surgery can be increased in a clinically relevant manner using proficiency based virtual reality simulator training. The performance level of novices was increased to that of intermediately experienced laparoscopists and operation time was halved. Simulator training should be considered before trainees carry out laparoscopic procedures. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00311792.
Medical Illustration,,,[Fertility preserving surgery for carcinoma of the cervix is now possible]. This article describes the first Swedish experience with fertility preserving surgery according to the technique of Dargent. Minimally invasive methods gain acceptance in the treatment of other tumours and this method seems to treat adequately and preserve function. The literature is reviewed and discussed. In Sweden about 25-40 women under 30 years of age are each year diagnosed with cancer of the cervix. Three women with early cancer of the cervix were treated and one successful pregnancy reported.
Precision Medicine,,,Efficacy and safety of edoxaban in comparison with dabigatran  rivaroxaban and apixaban for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. An indirect comparison analysis. Large Phase 3 clinical trials for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF) have compared non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) against warfarin  with the edoxaban trial only recently reported. In the absence of head to head trials directly comparing these NOACs against each other  we compared the efficacy and safety of edoxaban to other agents by an indirect comparison analysis. We performed an indirect comparison analysis of edoxaban (2 dose strategies) against apixaban (1 dose)  dabigatran etexilate (2 doses) and rivaroxaban (1 dose)  for their relative efficacy and safety against each other. For high-dose edoxaban vs apixaban  there were no significant differences in efficacy endpoints  mortality  myocardial infarction and major bleeding. Apixaban was associated with less major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding (hazard ratio [HR] 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70-0.90) and gastrointestinal bleeding (HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.53-0.99). For dabigatran 110 mg twice daily  there were no significant differences in the main efficacy or safety endpoints. Dabigatran 150 mg bid was associated with lower stroke/systemic embolism (SE) (HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.56-0.99)  stroke (HR 0.73; 95% CI 0.55-0.96) and haemorrhagic stroke (HR 0.48; 95% CI 0.23-0.99). There were no significant differences between high-dose edoxaban vs rivaroxaban for efficacy endpoints or mortality  but rivaroxaban had more major and/or clinically relevant non-major bleeding. When compared to low-dose edoxaban  apixaban was associated with lower stroke/SE (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.55-0.89)  stroke (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.55-0.92) and ischaemic stroke (HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.50-0.89)  but more major bleeding (HR 1.47; 95% CI 1.20-1.80). For dabigatran 110 mg bid  there were no significant differences in the efficacy endpoints  but dabigatran 110 mg bid had higher major (and gastrointestinal) bleeding. Dabigatran 150 mg bid and rivaroxaban were associated with lower stroke/SE and ischaemic stroke  but higher bleeding rates. In the present analysis  we have provided for the first time  comparisons of efficacy and safety of edoxaban against other NOACs. Notwithstanding the significant limitations of an indirect comparison analysis  some differential effects are evident with the NOACs for stroke prevention  allowing us to allow the prescriber a 'choice' to be able to fit the drug to the patient clinical profile (and vice versa).
Emergency Medicine,,,The effect of multi-professional education on the recognition and outcome of patients at risk on general wards. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of multi-professional full-scale simulation-based education of staff on the mortality and staff awareness of patients at risk on general wards. DESIGN  SETTINGS AND PATIENTS: A prospective before-and-after study conducted on four general wards at Herlev Hospital  Denmark. In the pre-intervention period (June-July 2006) and post-intervention period (November-December 2007)  all patients on the wards had vital signs measured in the evening by study personnel  who also asked nursing staff questions about patients with abnormal vital signs. The mortality of patients with abnormal vital signs was registered from the hospital database. Simplified medical emergency team calling criteria were used to define abnormal vital signs. In the intervention period (February-June 2007)  50% of medical and 70% of nursing staff on the wards (app. 220 members of staff) were trained in a 1-day multi-professional full-scale simulation-based course. In the pre- and post-intervention periods  690 and 873 patients were included and of these 129 and 155  respectively  had abnormal vital signs. No significant differences were observed between the pre- and post-intervention periods concerning the incidence of patients with abnormal vital signs (p=0.64)  staff awareness of patients at risk (p=0.80)  30-day mortality (p=1.00)  180-day mortality (p=1.00) or length of hospital stay (p=0.11) among patients at risk. This multi-professional education of staff did not affect the rate of mortality or staff awareness of patients at risk on the wards.
Rheumatology,,,Using an electronic platform interactively to improve treatment outcome in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: new developments from the DANBIO registry. Electronic platforms have been developed to help the clinician monitor disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to support at treat-to-target strategy. We present an initiative to interactively improve disease control in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In patients who presented with one or more swollen joints AND moderate/high disease activity (i.e. either CDAI≥10.1 and/or DAS-28CRP>3.2  which is automatically calculated in the DANBIO registry)  a red alert was shown  which activated a pop-up: "This patient has at least one swollen joint AND either CDAI≥ 10.1 or DAS28CRP>3.2. Which action do you as a physician take today: □ Intensify treatment  □ Treatment intensification is not possible currently/awaiting results of additional investigations  □ No further treatment intensification is possible  □ The patient does not want to intensify treatment  □ Other decisions taken" RESULTS: Of 21 056 patients with RA  40% fulfilled the criteria for getting the alert message. The pop-up was activated and completed by the physician in 65% of those (5 428 patients). Treatment was intensified in 67%. In 2% of patients  no additional treatment intensification was possible  and 8% of the patients objected to intensification. In >8 000 RA patients who presented with objective signs of active disease in routine care  an interactive feature of the DANBIO registry was introduced  which prompted the physician to take action and consider treatment intensification. In two-thirds of the cases  the treating physician reported that treatment was intensified.
Family Practice,Occupational Medicine,,Effects of a multidisciplinary stress treatment programme on patient return to work rate and symptom reduction: results from a randomised  wait-list controlled trial. To evaluate the efficacy of a multidisciplinary stress treatment programme. General practitioners referred 198 employed patients on sick leave with symptoms of persistent work-related stress. Using a waitlisted randomised controlled trial design  the participants were randomly divided into the following three groups: the intervention group (IG  69 participants); treatment-as-usual control group (TAUCG  71 participants)  which received 12 consultations with a psychologist  and the waitlisted control group (WLCG  58 participants). The stress treatment intervention consisted of nine 1-hour sessions conducted over 3 months. The goals of the sessions were the following: (1) identifying relevant stressors; (2) changing the participant's coping strategies; (3) adjusting the participant's workload and tasks  and (4) improving workplace dialogue. Each participant also attended a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) course for 2 h a week over 8 weeks. The IG and TAUCG showed significantly greater symptom level (Symptom Check List 92) reductions compared to the WLCG. Regarding the return to work (RTW) rate  67% of participants in the IG returned to full-time work after treatment  which was a significantly higher rate than in the TAUCG (36%) and WLCG (24%). Significantly more participants in the IG (97%) increased their working hours during treatment compared with the participants in the control groups  TAUCG (71%) and WLCG (64%). The stress treatment programme--a combination of work place-focused psychotherapy and MBSR--significantly reduced stress symptom levels and increased RTW rates compared with the WLCG and TAUCG.
Occupational Medicine,,,Effect of a multidisciplinary stress treatment programme on the return to work rate for persons with work-related stress. A non-randomized controlled study from a stress clinic. In recent years an increasing number of patients have been referred to the medical sector with stress symptoms. Moreover  these conditions imply increased sickness absence. This indicates a need for treatment programmes in general medical practice. The aim of this study was to test the effect of a multidisciplinary stress treatment programme on the return to work (RTW) rate in persons with work-related stress and establish predictive factors for this outcome. During a two-year period 63 out of 73 referrals to the Stress Clinic (a section of a Clinic of Occupational Medicine) completed a stress treatment programme consisted of the following:1) Identification of relevant stressors. 2. Changing the coping strategies of the participants. 3. Evaluating/changes in participant workload and tasks. 4. Relaxation techniques. 5. Physical exercise. 6. Psychiatric evaluation when indicated by depression test score.On average each patient attended six one-hour sessions over the course of four months.A group of 34 employees referred to the Clinic of Occupational Medicine by their general practitioners served as a control group. Each participant had a one-hour consultation at baseline and after four months. A specialist in occupational medicine carried out all sessions.Return To Work (RTW)  defined as having a job and not being on sick leave at the census  was used as outcome measure four months after baseline  and after one and two years. The level of sick leave in the stress treatment group dropped from 52% to 16% during the first four months of follow-up and remained stable. In the control group  the reduction in sick leave was significantly smaller  ranging from 48% at baseline to 27% after four months and 24% after one year. No statistically significant difference between the two groups was observed after one and two years. Age below 50 years and being a manager increased the odds ratio for RTW after one and two years  while gender and depression had no predictive value. The stress treatment programme showed a significant effect on the return to work rate. The stress treatment programme seems feasible for general practitioners. ISRCTN04354658.
Global Health,,,Ocular adnexal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: a multicenter international study. The clinical features of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) subtype of ocular adnexal lymphoma have not previously been evaluated in a large cohort to our knowledge. To investigate the clinical features of ocular adnexal DLBCL (OA-DLBCL). This retrospective international cooperative study involved 6 eye cancer centers. During 30 years  106 patients with OA-DLBCL were identified  and 6 were excluded from the study. The median follow-up period was 52 months. Overall survival  disease-specific survival (DSS)  and progression-free survival were the primary end points. One hundred patients with OA-DLBCL were included in the study (median age  70 years)  of whom 54 (54.0%) were female. The following 3 groups of patients with lymphoma could be identified: primary OA-DLBCL (57.0%)  OA-DLBCL and concurrent systemic lymphoma (29.0%)  and ocular adnexal lymphoma relapse of previous systemic lymphoma (14.0%). Of 57 patients with primary OA-DLBCL  53 (93.0%) had Ann Arbor stage IE disease  and 4 (7.0%) had Ann Arbor stage IIE disease. According to the TNM staging system  43 of 57 (75.4%) had T2 tumors. Among all patients  the most frequent treatments were external beam radiation therapy with or without surgery (31.0%) and rituximab-cyclophosphamide  hydroxydaunorubicin  vincristine sulfate  prednisone (CHOP) or rituximab-CHOP-like chemotherapy with or without external beam radiation therapy (21.0%). The 5-year overall survival among the entire cohort was 36.0% (median  3.5 years; 95% CI  2.5-4.5 years). Relapse occurred in 43.9% (25 of 57) of patients with primary OA-DLBCL. Increasing T category of the TNM staging system was predictive of DSS (P = .04) in primary OA-DLBCL  whereas the Ann Arbor staging system was not. However  when taking all 100 patients into account  Ann Arbor stage was able to predict DSS (P = .01). Women had a longer median DSS than men (9.8 years; 95% CI  1.9-17.7 years vs 3.3 years; 95% CI  1.6-5.0; P = .03). Most patients with primary OA-DLBCL were seen with Ann Arbor stage IE and TNM T2 disease. The 5-year overall survival was between 2.5 and 4.5 years  which is the 95% CI around the median of 3.5 years in this cohort. Increasing T category appears to be associated with decreased DSS among patients with primary OA-DLBCL. When taking all patients into account  sex and Ann Arbor stage also seem to be DSS predictors.
General Practice,,,The effectiveness of computer reminders for improving quality assessment for point-of-care testing in general practice--a randomized controlled trial. Computer reminders are increasingly being applied in efforts to improve quality and patient safety. However  research is still needed to establish the effectiveness of different kinds of reminders in various settings. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of computer reminders for improving adherence to a quality assessment scheme for point-of-care testing in general practice. The study was conducted as a randomized controlled crossover trial among general practices in the Capital Region of Denmark. The intervention consisted of sending computer reminders (ComRem) to practices not adhering to the guideline recommendations of split testing for hemoglobin and glucose. Practices were randomly allocated into two groups. During the first follow-up period  one of the groups received the ComRem intervention together with the general implementation activities (GIA)  while the other group only received the GIA. For the second follow-up period  the intervention was switched between the two groups. Outcomes were measured as split test procedure adherence. A total of 142 practices were randomly allocated to the early intervention group and 144 practices to the late intervention group (the control group in the first follow-up period). In the first intervention period  the mean number of split tests performed in the group receiving ComRem group increased from 1.22 to 3.76 (out of eight possible tests) while the mean number of split tests increased from 1.11 to 2.35 in the group targeted by GIA only (p = 0.0059). After the crossover  a similar effect of reminders was observed. Furthermore  the developments in outcome measures over time showed a strong effect of computer reminders beyond the intervention periods. There was a significant effect of computer reminders on adherence to the quality assessment scheme for point-of-care testing. Thus  computer reminders seem to be useful for supporting the implementation of relatively simple procedures for quality and safety. ClinicalTrials.gov: http://NCT01152177.
Telemedicine,,,Development of the eHealth Literacy Assessment Toolkit  eHLA. In a world with rising focus on the use of eHealth  the match between the competences of the individual and the demands of eHealth systems becomes increasingly important  thus making assessment of eHealth literacy as a measure of user competences a vital element. We propose the eHealth Literacy Assessment toolkit  eHLA  evaluating the user by seven scales: computer familiarity  confidence  incentive and performance as well as functional health literacy  health literacy self-assessment and health literacy performance  as a first step toward development of technology that accommodates the literacy level of the user.
Cardiology,,,The acquisition and retention of ECG interpretation skills after a standardized web-based ECG tutorial-a randomised study. Electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation is of great importance for patient management. However  medical students frequently lack proficiency in ECG interpretation and rate their ECG training as inadequate. Our aim was to examine the effect of a standalone web-based ECG tutorial and to assess the retention of skills using multiple follow-up intervals. 203 medical students were included in the study. All participants completed a pre-test  an ECG tutorial  and a post-test. The participants were also randomised to complete a retention-test after short (2-4 weeks)  medium (10-12 weeks)  or long (18-20 weeks) follow-up. Intragroup comparisons of test scores were done using paired-samples t-test. Intergroup comparisons of test scores were performed using independent-samples t-test and ANOVA  whereas demographic data were compared using ANOVA and Chi-squared test. The overall mean test score improved significantly from 52.7 (SD 16.8) in the pre-test to 68.4 (SD 12.3) in the post-test (p < 0.001). Junior and senior students demonstrated significantly different baseline scores (45.5 vs. 57.8 points; p < 0.001)  but showed comparable score gains (16.5 and 15.1 points  respectively; p = 0.48). All three follow-up groups experienced a decrease in test score between post-test and retention-test: from 67.4 (SD 12.3) to 60.2 (SD 8.3) in the short follow-up group  from 71.4 (SD 12.0) to 60.8 (SD 8.9) in the medium follow-up group  and from 66.1 (SD 12.1) to 58.6 (SD 8.6) in the long follow-up group (p < 0.001 for all). However  there were no significant differences in mean retention-test score between the groups (p = 0.33). Both junior and senior students showed a decline in test score at follow-up (from 62.0 (SD 10.6) to 56.2 (SD 9.8) and from 72.9 (SD 11.4) to 62.5 (SD 6.6)  respectively). When comparing the pre-test to retention-test delta scores  junior students had learned significantly more than senior students (junior students improved 10.7 points and senior students improved 4.7 points  p = 0.003). A standalone web-based ECG tutorial can be an effective means of teaching ECG interpretation skills to medical students. The newly acquired skills are  however  rapidly lost when the intervention is not repeated.
Telemedicine,,,Collaborative efforts are needed to ensure proper knowledge dissemination of telemedicine projects. Telemedicine is often seen as the solution to the challenge of providing health care for an increasing number of people with chronic conditions. Projects are often organised locally and based on the involvement of stakeholders with a wide range of backgrounds. It can be challenging to ensure that projects are based on previous experience and that they do not repeat previous studies. To better understand these challenges and current practice  we examined telemedicine projects funded in the 2008-2010 period to explore where  how and to what extent results from the projects were documented and disseminated. Public and private funds were contacted for information about telemedicine studies focusing on people residing in their homes. After an initial screening of titles and abstracts  19 projects were identified. The managers of the projects were contacted and information about project results and dissemination were obtained. More than half of all projects were disseminated to professionals as well as to the public and used two-way communication. However  it was generally difficult to obtain an overview of the projects due to dynamic changes in names and scopes. We propose that the funding authorities require designs comprising proper evaluation models that will subsequently allow the investigators to publish their findings. Furthermore  a dissemination plan comprising both peers and other professions should be made mandatory. The investigators should ensure proper documentation and dissemination of changes both during and after the projects in order to ensure transparency  and national or international organisations should establish a database with relevant data fields. not relevant. not relevant.
Epidemiology,,,Early menarche is associated with increased risk of asthma: Prospective population-based study of twins. To examine the association between early menarche and risk of post-menarcheal asthma. Using data from two multidisciplinary questionnaire surveys  conducted eight years apart  we prospectively studied 10 648 female twins  12-41 years of age  from the nationwide Danish Twin Registry. Early menarche was defined as menarche before 12 years of age. We performed a cohort analysis and a co-twin control analysis including twin pairs discordant for incident asthma. Early menarche was observed in 9.3% of the individuals. The eight-year cumulative incidence of asthma was higher in girls with early menarche compared to girls without early menarche (7.4 vs. 4.5%)  OR = 1.71 (1.31-2.22)  p < 0.001; also after adjustment for BMI  current age  physical activity  education  and smoking  OR = 1.53 (1.15-2.04)  p = 0.003. The unadjusted risk of asthma was increased by 8% (1-15%)  p = 0.041 per year earlier menarche occurred. Among 167 twin pairs discordant for incident asthma  there was a non-significant tendency towards early menarche being more common in the asthmatic than the non-asthmatic co-twin (12.0 vs. 9.6%)  OR = 1.57 (0.61-4.05)  p = 0.350. The risk of asthma was not uniform in discordant monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Early menarche is associated with increased risk of asthma among Danish female twins independently of BMI  age  physical activity  educational level and smoking. Results indicate a complex relationship possibly mediated through innate and non-genetic effects.
Ecotoxicology,,,Species composition of a soil invertebrate multi-species test system determines the level of ecotoxicity. A soil multi-species  SMS  experimental test system consisting of the natural microbial community  five collembolan species and a predatory mite along with either Enchytraeus crypticus or the earthworm Eisenia fetida were exposed to α-cypermethrin. A comparison of the performance of these two types of SMSs is given to aid the development of a standard test system. E. fetida had a positive effect on the majority of the species  reducing the negative insecticide effect. E. fetida affected the species sensitivity and decreased the degradation of the insecticide due to the organic matter incorporation of earthworm food. After 8 weeks  the EC50 was 0.76 mg kg(-1) for enchytraeids and ranged between 2.7 and 18.9 mg kg(-1) for collembolans  more sensitive than previously observed with single species. Changes observed in the community structure and function illustrates the strength of a multi-species test system as an ecotoxicological tool compared to single species tests.
Family Practice,,,[Quality indicators for type 2 diabetes at referral to diabetes centre]. The Danish National Board of Health recommends graduated care of type 2 diabetes patients based on risk stratification. This requires a systematic monitoring of indicators for the development of complications. Retrospective evaluation of type 2 diabetes patients referred from general practice in the 2004-2007 period. 1) Diabetes duration = two years  2) Diabetes control exclusively handled in primary care in the previous two years  3) Referred from general practice to outpatient assessment by the diabetes centre  4) The physician used a laboratory affiliated to the Aarhus County laboratory database  5) Written referral could be found. Data was gathered by reviewing records  searching the laboratory database and register of diabetic eye care service. A total of 97 patients were included. By the time at referral (mean): Age 61.5 years  diabetes duration 8.4 years  body mass index 31.7 kg/m2. In the last two years before referral  the following percentage had at least one p-lipid measurement: 85%  eye examination: 61% and measurement of microalbuminuria: 53%. HbA1c at referral was 9.0% (n = 97)  9.1% (n = 93) seven months before and 8.7% (n = 82) 20 months before referral. Glycaemic control was poor 20 months before referral. The prerequisites for the recommendation of The Danish National Board of Health was not present since eye examination was not performed in 39% and assessment of microalbuminuria was not performed in 47% of the patients in the previous two years before referral.
Health Physics,,,Equipment for neutron measurements at VR-1 Sparrow training reactor. The VR-1 sparrow reactor is an experimental nuclear facility for training  student education and teaching purposes. The sparrow reactor is an educational platform for the basic experiments at the reactor physic and dosimetry. The aim of this article is to describe the new experimental equipment EMK310 features and possibilities for neutron detection by different gas filled detectors at VR-1 reactor. Among the EMK310 equipment typical attributes belong precise set-up  simple control  resistance to electromagnetic interference  high throughput (counting rate)  versatility and remote controllability. The methods for non-linearity correction of pulse neutron detection system and reactimeter application are presented.
Epidemiology,,,Influence of assessment instrument on ADHD diagnosis. We compared four instruments commonly used to screen for and diagnose Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children. The Bergen Child Study included a DSM-IV ADHD symptom list and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) as screen in Phase one. Phase two included the parent Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA)  whereas Phase three comprised in-depth clinical assessment  including the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Aged Children (K-SADS). We compared ADHD as diagnosed by the four instruments in the children with normal intellectual functioning participating in all three phases (N = 234). The DSM-IV ADHD symptom list showed moderate agreement with all other instruments (κ = 0.53-0.57)  whereas there was fair agreement between the K-SADS-DAWBA (κ = 0.31) and between SDQ-DAWBA (κ = 0.33). The DAWBA diagnosed fewer children with ADHD than did the other instruments. Implications for use of the instruments are discussed.
Emergency Medicine,Obstetrics,,Clinical skills training in obstetrics - a descriptive survey of current practice in Denmark. The Danish National Board of Health has recommended that labor wards establish regular obstetric emergency skills training programs. The aim of this study was to describe current practice in Denmark. A questionnaire was sent to all obstetric departments in Denmark in 2008. All responded. Simulation-based training was conducted in 26/28 obstetrical departments. Settings for the training programs were mainly local. Training was provided for shoulder dystocia  postpartum bleeding and basic neonatal resuscitation in almost all the departments  but was not organized in a uniform way. Neither the program itself nor the participants' performance was evaluated in a structured or validated way. Obstetric emergency skills training is being actively conducted in the majority of the Danish labor wards. However  it still remains a challenge to ensure the uniform organization and evaluation of the current training programs. Development of validated national or international standards for an obstetric training program should be a future aim.
Obstetrics,,,The implementation and evaluation of a mandatory multi-professional obstetric skills training program. OBJECTIVE. To implement and evaluate a simulation-based training program. DESIGN. Descriptive. June 2003-June 2006. SETTING. Obstetric Department  Copenhagen University Hospital  Rigshospitalet  Copenhagen  Denmark. POPULATION. Two training sessions were provided for all health professionals including doctors  midwives  auxiliary nurses  and 147 out 156 participants (94%) took part in the first training session and 192 out possible 201 (96%) took part in the second session. METHODS. An intervention study of the impact of simulation-based training in management of postpartum bleeding  shoulder dystocia  basic neonatal resuscitation  and severe preeclampsia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES. Before  just after and 9-15 months following the training  data were collected on the confidence and stress levels relating to the carrying out of certain procedures. In addition  a written objective test on basic neonatal resuscitation was administered. Data on any changes in work-routines experienced by the participants were obtained by open-ended questions. Registry data from the Danish Medical Birth Registry and from the hospital administration were included in the analysis. RESULTS. Ninety-two percent of all respondents had a positive attitude toward the training program. They considered management of shoulder dystocia  preeclampsia  and neonatal resuscitation less stresful and less unpleasant to perform after training. Confidence scores for all the trained skills improved significantly. A significant association was found between confidence in neonatal resuscitation and numbers of correct answers in the objective test. More than 90% found the training to have had a positive influence on their work. The need for organizational changes in the department became evident and necessary changes were implemented. Sick leave amongst midwives diminished significantly during the study period. CONCLUSIONS. A comprehensive evaluation of a mandatory simulation-based program  implemented in a obstetric department  demonstrated a positive impact at individual and organizational levels.
Telemedicine,,,Telemedicine support shortens length of stay after fast-track hip replacement. Background and purpose - Telemedicine could allow patients to be discharged more quickly after surgery and contribute to improve fast-track procedures without compromising quality  patient safety  functionality  anxiety  or other patient-perceived parameters. We investigated whether using telemedicine support (TMS) would permit hospital discharge after 1 day without loss of self-assessed quality of life  loss of functionality  increased anxiety  increased rates of re-admission  or increased rates of complications after hip replacement. Patients and methods - We performed a randomized controlled trial involving 72 Danish patients in 1 region who were referred for elective fast-track total hip replacement between August 2009 and March 2011 (654 were screened for eligibility). Half of the patients received a telemedicine solution connected to their TV. The patients were followed until 1 year after surgery. Results - Length of stay was reduced from 2.1 days (95% CI: 2.0-2.3) to 1.1 day (CI: 0.9-1.4; p < 0.001) with the TMS intervention. Health-related quality of life increased in both groups  but there were no statistically significant differences between groups. There were also no statistically significant differences between groups regarding timed up-and-go test and Oxford hip score at 3-month follow-up. At 12-month follow-up  the rates of complications and re-admissions were similar between the groups  but the number of postoperative hospital contacts was lower in the TMS group. Interpretation - Length of postoperative stay was shortened in patients with the TMS solution  without compromising patient-perceived or clinical parameters in patients undergoing elective fast-track surgery. These results indicate that telemedicine can be of value in fast-track treatment of patients undergoing total hip replacement.
Sports Medicine,Radiology,,The Copenhagen Standardised MRI protocol to assess the pubic symphysis and adductor regions of athletes: outline and intratester and intertester reliability. There is currently no standardised MRI evaluation protocol for athletes who present with symptoms that may relate to the pubic symphysis  the pubic bones  and the adductor muscle insertions. We outline the protocol and reliability data. Three musculoskeletal radiologists developed an 11-element MRI evaluation protocol defined according to precise criteria and illustrated in a pictorial atlas. Eighty-six male athletes (soccer players and non-soccer players) underwent standardised 3 Tesla MRI of the pelvis. Two external musculoskeletal radiologists were trained to use the protocol and pictorial atlas during two sessions of 2-4 h each. Each radiologist rated all 86 MRI independently. One radiologist evaluated the scans once  the other twice 2 months apart. Cohen κ statistics were used to determine intraobserver and interobserver agreement. The main findings were (1) substantial intraobserver (κ range 0.65-0.67) and moderate interobserver (κ range 0.45-0.52) agreement in rating pubic bone marrow oedema  (2) substantial to moderate intraobserver (κ range 0.49-0.72) and moderate-to-fair interobserver (κ range 0.21-0.52) agreement in rating most other MRI findings  (3) slight intraobserver and interobserver (κ range -0.06-0.05) agreement in rating adductor longus tendinopathy. The Copenhagen Standardised MRI protocol demonstrated moderate-to-substantial reliability in rating bone marrow oedema  and varied from fair-to-substantial agreement for the majority of MRI features  but showed only slight agreement in rating adductor longus tendinopathy. This rigorous investigation also confirms that while MRI evaluation seems to provide reasonable reliability in rating pubic bone marrow oedema  the evaluation of adductor tendinopathy in a clinical and research setting needs further resolution by continued development and testing of MRI acquisition protocols.
Midwifery,,,Healthcare professionals experience with motivational interviewing in their encounter with obese pregnant women. to explore and describe how healthcare professionals in the Southern Region of Denmark experienced motivational interviewing as a communication method when working with pregnant women with obesity. a qualitative  descriptive study based on face-to-face interviews with 11 obstetric healthcare professionals working in a perinatal setting. a thematic descriptive method was applied to semi-structured interviews. The healthcare professional's experiences were recorded verbatim during individual semi-structured qualitative interviews  transcribed  and analysed using a descriptive analysis methodology. motivational interviewing was found to be a useful method when communicating with obese pregnant women. The method made the healthcare professionals more aware of their own communication style both when encountering pregnant women and in their interaction with colleagues. However  most of the healthcare professionals emphasised that time was crucial and they had to be dedicated to the motivational interviewing method. The healthcare professionals further stated that it enabled them to become more professional in their daily work and made some of them feel less 'burned out'  'powerless' and 'stressed' as they felt they had a communication method in handling difficult workloads. healthcare professionals experienced motivational interviewing to be a useful method when working perinatally. The motivational interviewing method permitted heightened awareness of the healthcare professionals communication method with the patients and increased their ability to handle a difficult workload. Overall  lack of time restricted the use of the motivational interviewing method on a daily basis.
Family Practice,,,Predictive validity of common mental disorders screening questionnaire as a screening instrument in long term sickness absence. Screening instruments for detection of common mental disorders have not been validity tested in long term sickness absence (LSA)  which is the aim of this study for the Common Mental Disorders Screening Questionnaire (CMD-SQ). Of all 2 414 incident persons on continuous sick-leave for more than eight weeks in a Danish population of 120 000 inhabitants 1 121 participated in a two-phased study by being screened for mental disorders by CMD-SQ in Phase 1. A subgroup of 337 was examined by a psychiatrist and diagnosed with Present State Examination in Phase 2. Results performed on Phase 2 were weighted up to Phase 1. Test performance was analyzed by ROC-analyses  and the fraction with a positive screening test  Q  the sensitivity SE  and 1 minus the specificity  SP  were plotted against decreasing cut-point in the tested scales for specific diagnostic groups. A sub-scale in CMD-SQ  SCL-8AD  compiled of SCL-ANX4  SCL-8  and SCL-DEP6  showed the best psychometric properties in detection of any mental disorder (AUC 0.80). Other scales were tested as well. The psychometric properties were dependent on sex and age. The plots of Q  SE  and 1-SP against decreasing cut-point gave a comprehensive view of the performance of the scales  which could be of significance in addressing the ethical aspects of screening. SCL-8AD is a promising candidate for the screening of mental disorders in LSA. It is intended to be administered by the social services because in Denmark there is not a legal requirement that sick-listed persons are certified as sick by a physician.
Reproductive Medicine,,,Ex vivo investigations on the potential of optical coherence tomography (OCT) as a diagnostic tool for reproductive medicine in a bovine model. Routine infertility investigations in the male and female include imaging techniques such as ultrasonography and endoscopy (fertiloscopy). However  these techniques lack the resolution to localize vital sperm or to reveal detailed morphological analysis of the oviduct which is often the cause of infertility in females. Therefore we set out to evaluate the efficiency of optical coherence tomography (OCT) as a diagnostic imaging tool for micron-scale visualization of the male and female genital tract. Using the bovine as a model  the optical features of the Telesto(TM)   Ganymede(TM) (both Thorlabs) and Niris(TM) (Imalux) OCT imaging systems were compared.
Dermatology,,,Melanocytic tumour with unknown malignant potential--a Danish study of 67 patients. The aim of our single clinical centre study was to evaluate the risk of local metastases  lymph node metastases and distant metastases in patients diagnosed with melanocytic tumour with unknown malignant potential (MELTUMP). Furthermore  we evaluated several histologic tumour characteristics as potential predictive factors. From 1 January 1999 to 30 June 2011  a total of 67 consecutive patients were diagnosed with MELTUMP in our hospital. In this study  all the pathology slides were reviewed by the same independent expert dermatopathologist. All data were retrieved from patient charts. Four patients (6%) had regional nodal dissemination at the time of the diagnosis. Furthermore  one patient (1%) developed regional spread during follow-up and another patient (1%) died from distant metastases 1 year after diagnosis. We found no predictive factors with regard to histologic tumour characteristics. Our study confirms the low malignant potential of MELTUMP. We found a low risk of nodal metastasis and mortality from distant metastasis during follow-up. We recommend that all patients diagnosed with MELTUMP should be treated according to the guidelines for invasive melanoma.
Pediatrics,,,Consensus paper on post-operative pediatric cerebellar mutism syndrome: the Iceland Delphi results. Confusion has surrounded the description of post-operative mutism and associated morbidity in pediatric patients with cerebellar tumors for years. The heterogeneity of definitions and diagnostic features has hampered research progress within the field  and to date  no international guidelines exist on diagnosis  prevention  treatment  or follow-up of this debilitating condition. An international group of clinicians and researchers from multiple relevant disciplines recently formed a cohesive panel to formulate a new working definition and agree upon standardized methods for diagnosis and follow-up. Consensus was obtained using the modified nominal group technique  involving four rounds of online Delphi questionnaires interspersed with a structured consensus conference with lectures  group work  and open discussion sessions. A new  proposed definition of "post-operative pediatric CMS" was formed  preliminary recommendations for diagnostic and follow-up procedures were created  two working groups on a new scoring scale and risk prediction and prevention were established  and areas were identified where further information is needed. The consensus process was motivated by desire to further research and improve quality of life for pediatric brain tumor patients. The Delphi rounds identified relevant topics and established basic agreement  while face-to-face engagement helped resolve matters of conflict and refine terminology. The new definition is intended to provide a more solid foundation for future clinical and research work. It is thought as a consensus for moving forward and hopefully paves the way to developing a standard approach to this challenging problem with the advent of better scoring methods and ultimate goal of reducing the risk of CMS.
Family Practice,,,[Patients' evaluations as quality measurements in general practice]. Patients' evaluations have several functions as quality measurements: A general judgement of the quality of the health care system and a direct assessment of defined aspects of service and care. In this article the concept of patient satisfaction and the application of patients' evaluations on quality improvement in the health care system is discussed. Despite many attempts to formulate an explanatory theory about the matter  a useful theoretical basis for the concept of satisfaction is still missing. This does not imply the exclusion of patients' evaluation of the health system  and it is discussed why and in which areas of quality improvement patients should be involved and how their evaluations should be interpreted. Studies including patients' evaluations are referred to and discussed.
Urology,,,Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) in urology: a systematic review of outcome in Peyronie's disease  erectile dysfunction and chronic pelvic pain. The objective was to evaluate high-level evidence studies of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) for urological disorders. We included randomized controlled trials reporting outcomes of ESWT in urology. Literature search on trials published in English using EMBASE  Medline and PubMed was carried out. The systematic review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. We identified 10 trials on 3 urological indications. Two of 3 trials on Peyronie's disease (PD) involving 238 patients reported improvement in pain; however  no clinical significant changes in penile deviation and plaque size were observed. Four studies on erectile dysfunction (ED) including 337 participants were included. Using International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-EF) and erectile hardness scale (EHS) data suggested a significant positive effect of ESWT in phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (PDE-5i) responders in 2 of 4 trials and 3 of 4 trials  respectively. Three studies on chronic pelvic pain (CPP) engaging 200 men reported positive changes in National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI). There was considerable heterogeneity between trials both with regard to treatment techniques and outcome measures  making it difficult to compare results. ESWT may resolve pain in PD patients  while evidence for reducing curvature and plaques size is poor. Effects of ESWT on IIEF in ED patients are inconsistent; however  data on EHS does imply that the treatment potentially may recover natural erection in PDE-5i responders. ESWT seems to be able to resolve pain in CPP patients in the short term. In all three disease entities  long-term outcome data are still warranted.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Electronic symptom reporting between patient and provider for improved health care service quality: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials. part 2: methodological quality and effects. We conducted in two parts a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on electronic symptom reporting between patients and providers to improve health care service quality. Part 1 reviewed the typology of patient groups  health service innovations  and research targets. Four innovation categories were identified: consultation support  monitoring with clinician support  self-management with clinician support  and therapy. To assess the methodological quality of the RCTs  and summarize effects and benefits from the methodologically best studies. We searched Medline  EMBASE  PsycINFO  Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials  and IEEE Xplore for original studies presented in English-language articles between 1990 and November 2011. Risk of bias and feasibility were judged according to the Cochrane recommendation  and theoretical evidence and preclinical testing were evaluated according to the Framework for Design and Evaluation of Complex Interventions to Improve Health. Three authors assessed the risk of bias and two authors extracted the effect data independently. Disagreement regarding bias assessment  extraction  and interpretation of results were resolved by consensus discussions. Of 642 records identified  we included 32 articles representing 29 studies. No articles fulfilled all quality requirements. All interventions were feasible to implement in a real-life setting  and theoretical evidence was provided for almost all studies. However  preclinical testing was reported in only a third of the articles. We judged three-quarters of the articles to have low risk for random sequence allocation and approximately half of the articles to have low risk for the following biases: allocation concealment  incomplete outcome data  and selective reporting. Slightly more than one fifth of the articles were judged as low risk for blinding of outcome assessment. Only 1 article had low risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel. We excluded 12 articles showing high risk or unclear risk for both selective reporting and blinding of outcome assessment from the effect assessment. The authors' hypothesis was confirmed for 13 (65%) of the 20 remaining articles. Articles on self-management support were of higher quality  allowing us to assess effects in a larger proportion of studies. All except one self-management interventions were equally effective to or better than the control option. The self-management articles document substantial benefits for patients  and partly also for health professionals and the health care system. Electronic symptom reporting between patients and providers is an exciting area of development for health services. However  the research generally is of low quality. The field would benefit from increased focus on methods for conducting and reporting RCTs. It appears particularly important to improve blinding of outcome assessment and to precisely define primary outcomes to avoid selective reporting. Supporting self-management seems to be especially promising  but consultation support also shows encouraging results.
Nursing Evaluation Research,,,Swedish translation  adaptation and psychometric evaluation of the Context Assessment Index (CAI). The strength of and relationship between the fundamental elements context  evidence and facilitation of the PARIHS framework are proposed to be key for successful implementation of evidence into healthcare practice. A better understanding of the presence and strength of contextual factors is assumed to enhance the opportunities of adequately developing an implementation strategy for a specific setting. A tool for assessing context-The Context Assessment Index (CAI)-was developed and published 2009. A Swedish version of the instrument was developed and evaluated among registered nurses. This work forms the focus of this paper. The purpose of this study was to translate the CAI into Swedish  adapt the instrument for use in Swedish healthcare practice and assess its psychometric properties. The instrument was translated and back-translated to English. The feasibility of items and response scales were evaluated through think aloud interviews with clinically active nurses. Psychometric properties were evaluated in a sample of registered nurses (n = 373) working in a variety of healthcare organisations in the Stockholm area. Item and factor analyses and Cronbach's alpha were computed to evaluate internal structure and internal consistency. Sixteen items were modified based on the think aloud interviews and to adapt the instrument for use in acute care. A ceiling effect was observed for many items and the originally identified 37 item five-factor model was not confirmed. Item analyses showed an overlap between factors and indicated a one-dimensional scale. The Swedish version of the CAI has a wider application than the original instrument. This might have contributed to the differences in factor structure. Different opportunities for further development of the scale are discussed. Further evaluation of the psychometric properties of the CAI is required.
Telemedicine,,,Electronic symptom reporting by patients: a literature review. A literature review has been conducted to gain an overview of which technologies and patient groups have previously been employed in scientific studies with regard to patients reporting symptoms electronically. This paper presents preliminary results from the review  based on the abstracts from relevant publications. The Medline database search identified 974 publications. Of these  235 (24%) met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The number of studies has increased heavily over the past two decades. A lot of the studies are small with regard to sample size  but we see that the number of studies increase over time. Cancer and lung diseases are the largest diagnosis groups. Cancer symptom reporting seems to take place inside the healthcare institutions  while lung disease and musculoskeletal disease reporting mainly take place at home via Internet.
Telemedicine,,,Risk analysis of information security in a mobile instant messaging and presence system for healthcare. Instant messaging (IM) is suited for immediate communication because messages are delivered almost in real time. Results from studies of IM use in enterprise work settings make us believe that IM based services may prove useful also within the healthcare sector. However  today's public instant messaging services do not have the level of information security required for adoption of IM in healthcare. We proposed MedIMob  our own architecture for a secure enterprise IM service for use in healthcare. MedIMob supports IM clients on mobile devices in addition to desktop based clients. Security threats were identified in a risk analysis of the MedIMob architecture. The risk analysis process consists of context identification  threat identification  analysis of consequences and likelihood  risk evaluation  and proposals for risk treatment. The risk analysis revealed a number of potential threats to the information security of a service like this. Many of the identified threats are general when dealing with mobile devices and sensitive data; others are threats which are more specific to our service and architecture. Individual threats identified in the risks analysis are discussed and possible counter measures presented. The risk analysis showed that most of the proposed risk treatment measures must be implemented to obtain an acceptable risk level; among others blocking much of the additional functionality of the smartphone. To conclude on the usefulness of this IM service  it will be evaluated in a trial study of the human-computer interaction. Further work also includes an improved design of the proposed MedIMob architecture.
Family Practice,Specialization,,Difficulties in moving routine medical checks from the specialist level to the general practitioner level. We began a project to move routine medical checks for appropriate patients from the specialist level to the patient's normal general practitioner (GP). The GP's analysis and conclusions would be checked by the specialist  using electronic messaging. The idea for the project came from the top level of the regional health authority. Despite that  the project was closed down before pilot testing began. We used stakeholder theory as a post-project evaluation to analyse what happened and where it went wrong. A common mistake in project planning is to focus the planning effort on system tasks and not to pay attention to a well-thought-out handling of the project's stakeholders. This was what happened in our project. Ideal objectives and good political intentions are not enough to implement a new e-health service.
Cardiac Rehabilitation,,,Understanding and practice: a 7-year follow-up study on implementation of a cardiac rehabilitation program. The authors explore the perspectives of managers  health care professionals  and patients on a comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation program. Using qualitative methodology  they compare and analyze results from individual interviews and two conceptual modeling seminars held 7 years apart. Professionals and managers understood their own tasks in a professional-centered way that did not include the client's perspective. Patients believed they were not seen in their whole context. Initially  health care organization was fragmented  lacking clear leadership  coordination  and communication between levels of care. However  lack of common understandings of structure  process  and outcome in cardiac rehabilitation services hampered the implementation of program changes.
Rehabilitation Nursing,Stroke Rehabilitation,,Nursing Roles and Functions in the Acute and Subacute Rehabilitation of Patients With Stroke: Going All In for the Patient. The description of nursing roles and functions in rehabilitation of patients with stroke remains sparse. The aim of this study was to describe the experienced roles and functions of nurses during in-hospital rehabilitation of patients with stroke. Within a phenomenological hermeneutic approach  19 nurses working with in-hospital rehabilitation of patients with stroke participated in three focus group interviews during 2013. The nurses' experiences were described in two themes: (a) the nurse's role and function in relation to the patient's needs 24/7 and (b) the nurse's role and function in the interdisciplinary team. Getting to know the patient as a person was essential to the nurses to care for the patient's basic needs; these must come first working with rehabilitation and always include the relatives. Recognition of the team members' individual skills with focus on the patient's needs must be the center of attention. An interdisciplinary rehabilitation program actively needs to include the patient by integrating the patient's perspective in the goals as well as in daily rehabilitation. In the team  nurses had the role of coordinator and the patient's voice.
Pharmacoepidemiology,,,Management and interpretation of heterogeneous observational data: using insulin-like growth factor-I data from the NordiNet® International Outcome Study. The NordiNet® International Outcome Study (IOS)  a large-scale  non-interventional  multi-centre  real-world study of Norditropin® treatment  registers insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) values  as measured by different assays. This paper considers the potential biases introduced by using a single IGF-I reference data set in analysing NordiNet® IOS data. To evaluate possible biases from different IGF-I assays used across NordiNet® IOS  a mixed-effect linear model was fitted to IGF-I data (analyses on log-transformed data). Pre-growth hormone treatment (pre-GHT) IGF-I values were assumed to depend on diagnosis  sex and age. During GHT  a treatment-effect dependent on these factors was added. Differences between assays were assumed multiplicative on the original scale. Individual measurements were scaled to a common level (Nichols Advantage) giving adjusted IGF-I standard deviation score (SDS) values. In total  49 495 IGF-I measurements were available from 9481 paediatric patients. Mixed-effect linear modelling showed a systematic difference between IGF-I levels measured by different assays. Differences were minimised when assessing change in IGF-I SDS from the start of GHT to 1-year follow-up. This applied to values adjusted for actual-assay used and for unadjusted delta IGF-I SDS values. Largest differences between unadjusted change in IGF-I SDS values were: for growth hormone deficiency 0.1 (girls) and 0.3 (boys); for small-for-gestational age 0.1; and for Turner syndrome 0.2. Similar magnitude differences were seen for data with unknown assay. Analysis and modelling suggest the current approach to IGF-I data collection and analyses in the NordiNet® IOS is sound: in a large cohort without assay-used information  potential bias is minimised by analysing changes in IGF-I SDS.
Rehabilitation Nursing,Stroke Rehabilitation,,Nursing roles and functions in the inpatient neurorehabilitation of stroke patients: a literature review. Stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the world. In the United States  it was estimated that approximately 750 000 patients had a stroke annually. Denmark  with a population of 5.5 million  had about 12 500 cases of hospitalizations from stroke in 2009. Despite the patient's obvious need for complex nursing care and a common recognition of the nurse's central role in rehabilitation after a stroke  a description of their specific contributions appeared sparse. Therefore  a literature review was conducted using the matrix method. The purpose was to explore the nursing roles and functions identified in empirical research and to discern any possible evolution in the nursing roles and functions during a span of years. The rehabilitation literature related to inpatient rehabilitation after stroke during the period from 1997 to 2010 was reviewed. The total number of identified citations was 1 529. After screening for relevancy  134 eligible articles remained. Of these  30 articles were extracted into a table and formed the basis for the conclusion. We found that four nursing roles and functions described in 1997 still accommodated central aspects of the current nursing practice but also emerging changes reflecting a development in the nurses' responsibilities and contributions in conducting rehabilitation after a stroke. These changes seemed mainly to be shaped instigated by changes in the (1) patient role  (2) increasing interdisciplinary teamwork  and (3) focus on rehabilitation efforts conducted in the patient's environment.
General Practice,,,Associations between follow-up screening after gestational diabetes and early detection of diabetes--a register based study. Women whose pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes have a 7-fold higher risk of developing diabetes  primarily type 2. Early detection can prevent or delay the onset of late complications  for which follow-up screening is important. This study investigated the extent of participation in follow-up screening and the possible consequences of nonattendance in the Region of North Jutland  Denmark. In Danish national registers covering the years 1994-2011 we identified 2171 birthing women whose pregnancy was complicated by first-time gestational diabetes. Control visits to general practitioners and biochemical departments after giving birth were charted. Following national guidelines we defined four intervals for assessment of participation in follow-up screening. Diagnosis of diabetes or treatment with glucose-lowering agents after giving birth were also identified. Participation in follow-up screening and risk of diabetes was calculated. Time to obtaining diagnosis of diabetes or initiating treatment was analysed by Cox regression models. All models were adjusted for age  ethnicity and income. High attendance was found during the first control interval  after which attendance decreased with time after giving birth for both controls at general practitioners and biochemical departments. All differences in proportions were statistically significant. Women attending controls at general practitioners had a significantly higher risk of diabetes diagnosis and treatment after gestational diabetes than women not attending. The results for women attending testing at biochemical departments also showed an increased risk of initiation of treatment. Women attending at least one general practitioners control had a significantly higher risk of early diabetes diagnosis or treatment. Time to initiation of treatment was significantly higher for testing at biochemical departments. Women with high incomes had a significantly lower risk of diabetes diagnosis or initiation of treatment compared to low-income women. Participation in follow-up screening after gestational diabetes is low in the North Denmark Region. Follow-up screening ensures early detection of diabetes and initiation of treatment. Our results emphasize the importance of development of interventions to improve early detection and prevention of diabetes after gestational diabetes.
General Practice,,,Utilization of serology for the diagnosis of suspected Lyme borreliosis in Denmark: survey of patients seen in general practice. Serological testing for Lyme borreliosis (LB) is frequently requested by general practitioners for patients with a wide variety of symptoms. A survey was performed in order to characterize test utilization and clinical features of patients investigated for serum antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. During one calendar year a questionnaire was sent to the general practitioners who had ordered LB serology from patients in three Danish counties (population 1.5 million inhabitants). Testing was done with a commercial ELISA assay with purified flagella antigen from a Danish strain of B. afzelii. A total of 4 664 patients were tested. The IgM and IgG seropositivity rates were 9.2% and 3.3%  respectively. Questionnaires from 2 643 (57%) patients were available for analysis. Erythema migrans (EM) was suspected in 38% of patients  Lyme arthritis/disseminated disease in 23% and early neuroborreliosis in 13%. Age 0-15 years and suspected EM were significant predictors of IgM seropositivity  whereas suspected acrodermatitis was a predictor of IgG seropositivity. LB was suspected in 646 patients with arthritis  but only 2.3% were IgG seropositive. This is comparable to the level of seropositivity in the background population indicating that Lyme arthritis is a rare entity in Denmark  and the low pretest probability should alert general practitioners to the possibility of false positive LB serology. Significant predictors for treating the patient were a reported tick bite and suspected EM. A detailed description of the utilization of serology for Lyme borreliosis with rates of seropositivity according to clinical symptoms is presented. Low rates of seropositivity in certain patient groups indicate a low pretest probability and there is a notable risk of false positive results. 38% of all patients tested were suspected of EM  although this is not a recommended indication due to a low sensitivity of serological testing.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Infection control standards and accreditation--the way forward?]. Evidence-based guidelines on infection control have existed for the last decade. The infection control guidelines in  "The Danish Health Care Quality Assessment Programme" are based on these guidelines. Experience from Danish health care organisations which have been accredited by Joint Commission International and Health Quality Service is that leadership involvement in infection control improves priority and focus on infection control practice with the aim of preventing nosocomial infections. Therefore  national accreditation will by focus improve infection control in healthcare settings.
Molecular Epidemiology,,,Strain typing methods and molecular epidemiology of Pneumocystis pneumonia. Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) caused by the opportunistic fungal agent Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly P. carinii) continues to cause illness and death in HIV-infected patients. In the absence of a culture system to isolate and maintain live organisms  efforts to type and characterize the organism have relied on polymerase chain reaction-based approaches. Studies using these methods have improved understanding of PCP epidemiology  shedding light on sources of infection  transmission patterns  and potential emergence of antimicrobial resistance. One concern  however  is the lack of guidance regarding the appropriateness of different methods and standardization of these methods  which would facilitate comparing results reported by different laboratories.
General Surgery,Gynecology,Thoracic Surgery,Implementation of a Cross-specialty Training Program in Basic Laparoscopy. Several surgical specialties use laparoscopy and share many of the same techniques and challenges  such as entry approaches  equipment  and complications. However  most basic training programs focus on a single specialty. The objective of this study was to describe the implementation of a regional cross-specialty training program for basic laparoscopy  to increase the flexibility of educational courses  and to provide a more efficient use of simulation equipment. Using a regional training program in basic laparoscopy for gynecology as a model  we developed a cross-specialty training program for residents in surgery  gynecology  urology  and thoracic surgery. We reviewed data on training for the first year of the program and evaluated the program by using a scoring system for quality criteria for laparoscopic curricula and skills. We held 6 full-day theoretical courses involving 67 residents between September 1  2013  and August 31  2014. In the weeks following each course  residents practiced in a self-directed  distributed  and proficiency-based manner at a simulation center and in local hospital departments. A total of 57 residents completed the self-practice and a subsequent practical animal laboratory-based course. The structure of the training program was evaluated according to identified quality criteria for a skills laboratory  and the program scored 38 of a maximum 62 points. Implementation of a regional cross-specialty training program in basic laparoscopy is feasible. There are several logistic benefits of using a cross-specialty approach; however  it is important that local departments include specialty-specific components  together with clinical departmental follow-up.
Obstetrics,,,Clarifying the learning experiences of healthcare professionals with in situ and off-site simulation-based medical education: a qualitative study. To examine how the setting in in situ simulation (ISS) and off-site simulation (OSS) in simulation-based medical education affects the perceptions and learning experience of healthcare professionals. Qualitative study using focus groups and content analysis. Twenty-five healthcare professionals (obstetricians  midwives  auxiliary nurses  anaesthesiologists  a nurse anaesthetist and operating theatre nurse) participated in four focus groups and were recruited due to their exposure to either ISS or OSS in multidisciplinary obstetric emergencies in a randomised trial. Departments of obstetrics and anaesthesia  Rigshospitalet  Copenhagen  Denmark. Initially participants preferred ISS  but this changed after the training when the simulation site became of less importance. There was a strong preference for simulation in authentic roles. These perceptions were independent of the ISS or OSS setting. Several positive and negative factors in simulation were identified  but these had no relation to the simulation setting. Participants from ISS and OSS generated a better understanding of and collaboration with the various health professionals. They also provided individual and team reflections on learning. ISS participants described more experiences that would involve organisational changes than the OSS participants did. Many psychological and sociological aspects related to the authenticity of the learning experience are important in simulation  but the physical setting of the simulation as an ISS and OSS is the least important. Based on these focus groups OSS can be used provided that all other authenticity elements are taken into consideration and respected. The only difference was that ISS had an organisational impact and ISS participants talked more about issues that would involve practical organisational changes. ISS and OSS participants did  however  go through similar individual and team learning experiences.
Gynecology,,,Designing a Standardized Laparoscopy Curriculum for Gynecology Residents: A Delphi Approach. Evidence suggests that simulation leads to improved operative skill  shorter operating room time  and better patient outcomes. Currently  no standardized laparoscopy curriculum exists for gynecology residents. To design a structured laparoscopy curriculum for gynecology residents using Delphi consensus methodology. This study began with Delphi methodology to determine expert consensus on the components of a gynecology laparoscopic skills curriculum. We generated a list of cognitive content  technical skills  and nontechnical skills for training in laparoscopic surgery  and asked 39 experts in gynecologic education to rate the items on a Likert scale (1-5) for inclusion in the curriculum. Consensus was predefined as Cronbach α of ≥0.80. We then conducted another Delphi survey with 9 experienced users of laparoscopic virtual reality simulators to delineate relevant curricular tasks. Finally  a cross-sectional design defined benchmark scores for all identified tasks  with 10 experienced gynecologic surgeons performing the identified tasks at basic  intermediate  and advanced levels. Consensus (Cronbach α=0.85) was achieved in the first round of the curriculum Delphi  and after 2 rounds (Cronbach α=0.80) in the virtual reality curriculum Delphi. Consensus was reached for cognitive  technical  and nontechnical skills as well as for 6 virtual reality tasks. Median time and economy of movement scores defined benchmarks for all tasks. This study used Delphi consensus to develop a comprehensive curriculum for teaching gynecologic laparoscopy. The curriculum conforms to current educational standards of proficiency-based training  and is suggested as a standard in residency programs.
Gynecology,,,Medical students as facilitators for laparoscopic simulator training. Teaching basic clinical skills to student peers and residents by medical students has previously been shown effective. This study examines if medical students can facilitate laparoscopic procedural tasks to residents using a virtual reality simulator. This was a retrospective study comparing 2 groups of gynecology residents. One group was instructed by 2 student facilitators  and a resident facilitator instructed the other group. Facilitators in both the groups were experienced in laparoscopic simulator training. The outcome measures were time and repetitions to complete a laparoscopic simulator training program. A total of 51 residents participated: 15 in the student-facilitated group and 36 in the resident-facilitated group after 18 and 7 residents dropped out  respectively. The student-facilitated group averaged 230 minutes  while the resident-facilitated group averaged 200 minutes (p = 0.724). To complete the final examination module  the student-facilitated group required 19.5 repetitions vs 39.2 in the resident-facilitated group (p = 0.007). Our findings suggest that students can be used as facilitators as an alternative to residents when practicing on a laparoscopic virtual reality simulator.
Obstetric Nursing,Obstetrics,,Unannounced in situ simulation of obstetric emergencies: staff perceptions and organisational impact. To describe how unannounced in situ simulation (ISS) was perceived by healthcare professionals before and after its implementation  and to describe the organisational impact of ISS. Ten unannounced ISS involving all staff were scheduled March-August 2007. Questionnaire surveys on staff perceptions were conducted before (2003-2006) and after (2007-2008) implementation of unannounced ISS. Information from the debriefing sessions following each ISS constituted a proxy measure of the organisational impact of the ISS. Five out of ten of the unannounced ISS scheduled were conducted. Twenty-three members of the staff at work on a scheduled day for ISS were randomly selected to participate. Questionnaires before implementation revealed that 137/196 (70%) of staff members agreed or strongly agreed that ISS was a good idea and 52/199 (26%) thought it likely to be stressful and unpleasant. Questionnaires completed after implementation showed significantly more staff members  135/153 (89%)  thought ISS was a good idea. A significantly higher amount of staff members 50/153 (33%) found it to be stressful and unpleasant  and among midwives  15/59 (25%) were anxious about ISS  whereas none of the obstetricians reported this. Information obtained through debriefing sessions generated learning points. The number of staff members with a positive perception of multiprofessional unannounced ISS increased after implementation; however  one-third considered ISS to be stressful and unpleasant and midwives more frequently so. The specific perception of ISS by each healthcare profession should be taken into account when planning ISS. The information from the debriefing sessions showed that implementation of ISS had an impact as it provided information required for organisational changes.
Specialization,,,[The seven CanMEDS roles in postgraduate medical education should be revised]. The seven CanMEDS roles were adopted by the Danish reform in postgraduate medical education in 2004. The roles have become a natural part of defining specialist competence. However  the definition of the seven roles from 2000 might not be aligned with the perception of good medical practice anno 2013. It is recommended to redefine the seven roles to reach agreement with contemporary demands for specialist competence.
Molecular Epidemiology,,,Comparative genomic analysis of rapid evolution of an extreme-drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii clone. The emergence of extreme-drug-resistant (EDR) bacterial strains in hospital and nonhospital clinical settings is a big and growing public health threat. Understanding the antibiotic resistance mechanisms at the genomic levels can facilitate the development of next-generation agents. Here  comparative genomics has been employed to analyze the rapid evolution of an EDR Acinetobacter baumannii clone from the intensive care unit (ICU) of Rigshospitalet at Copenhagen. Two resistant A. baumannii strains  48055 and 53264  were sequentially isolated from two individuals who had been admitted to ICU within a 1-month interval. Multilocus sequence typing indicates that these two isolates belonged to ST208. The A. baumannii 53264 strain gained colistin resistance compared with the 48055 strain and became an EDR strain. Genome sequencing indicates that A. baumannii 53264 and 48055 have almost identical genomes-61 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found between them. The A. baumannii 53264 strain was assembled into 130 contigs  with a total length of 3 976 592 bp with 38.93% GC content. The A. baumannii 48055 strain was assembled into 135 contigs  with a total length of 4 049 562 bp with 39.00% GC content. Genome comparisons showed that this A. baumannii clone is classified as an International clone II strain and has 94% synteny with the A. baumannii ACICU strain. The ResFinder server identified a total of 14 antibiotic resistance genes in the A. baumannii clone. Proteomic analyses revealed that a putative porin protein was down-regulated when A. baumannii 53264 was exposed to antimicrobials  which may reduce the entry of antibiotics into the bacterial cell.
Pediatrics,,,Immunodeficiencies in children with chronic post tympanic otorrhoea. A minority of children treated with ventilation tubes develop chronic otorrhoea. To test the hypothesis that this condition might be caused by an underlying primary immunodeficiency  the immunological status was examined in a group of children with longstanding otorrhoea. Eighteen children who had suffered from otorrhoea for a minimum of six months and who did not respond to relevant therapy were included. Thorough cleansing and suction was performed including removal of ventilation tubes. Swabs were obtained for microbiology and blood was collected for immunological analyses. One child out of 18 had a normal immune status. Five demonstrated isolated humoral deficiencies  four had isolated cellular deficiencies  whereas combined defects were identified among eight children. The humoral deficiencies consisted of selective or partial immunoglobulin A deficiencies  immunoglobulin G subclass and mannanbinding lectin deficiencies. The cellular deficiencies most often involved the cytotoxic T cells and the natural killer cells. Primary immunodeficiencies were very prevalent in a highly selected group of children suffering from longstanding post tympanic otorrhoea. The condition should therefore be considered in case of chronic  refractory otorrhoea. The serostatus should be followed carefully to obtain information of the prognosis. Not relevant. Not relevant.
Pediatrics,,,Oral polio vaccination and low case fatality at the paediatric ward in Bissau  Guinea-Bissau. Oral polio vaccine (OPV) and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccines are given simultaneously in routine immunisation programmes in developing countries. It is therefore difficult to determine the separate effects of these vaccines on survival. We used the shortage of DTP vaccine in Bissau to examine the impact of OPV on the case fatality at the paediatric ward in Bissau. For 719 children less than 5 years of age whose vaccination card had been seen at admission and who had not yet received measles vaccine  having received OPV only was associated with a case fatality of 6% compared with 15% for children having received combined DTP and OPV vaccinations  the case fatality ratio (CFR) being 0.29 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11-0.77). Even if children fleeing the hospital were assumed to have died shortly after leaving the hospital  the case fatality would still be lower for children having received OPV only (CFR = 0.41; (95% CI 0.20-0.81)). The tendency was similar for children hospitalised with pneumonia  diarrhoea  and presumptive malaria. Control for background factors had no impact on the estimate. In areas with high mortality  OPV administered alone may have non-specific beneficial effects or DTP may have a negative effect for children who had received both DTP and OPV.
Nephrology,,,Teaching percutaneous renal biopsy using unfixed human cadavers. Percutaneous renal biopsy (PRB) is an important diagnostic procedure. Despite advances in its safety profile there remains a small but significant risk of bleeding complications. Traditionally  operators train to perform PRB through tutor instruction and directly supervised PRB attempts on real patients. We describe an approach to teaching operators to perform PRB using cadaveric simulation. We devised a full day course hosted in the Clinical Anatomy Skills Centre  with places for nine candidates. Course faculty consisted of two Consultant Nephrologists  two Nephrology trainees experienced in PRB  and one Radiologist. Classroom instruction included discussion of PRB indications  risk minimisation  and management of complications. Two faculty members acted as models for the demonstration of kidney localisation using real-time ultrasound scanning. PRB was demonstrated using a cadaveric model  and candidates then practised PRB using each cadaver model. Written candidate feedback was universally positive. Faculty considered the cadaveric model a realistic representation of live patients  while the use of multiple cadavers introduced anatomical variation. Our model facilitates safe simulation of a high risk procedure. This might reduce serious harm associated with PRB and improve patient safety  benefiting trainee operators and patients alike.
Stroke Rehabilitation,,,Fight like a ferret: a novel approach of using art therapy to reduce anxiety in stroke patients undergoing hospital rehabilitation. The holistic aspect of stroke rehabilitation to include psychological well-being is currently neglected  with more emphasis placed on physical recovery despite anxiety and depression being common poststroke. From the limited amount of current literature  it seems that creative strategies such as art therapy (AT) can be beneficial in reducing isolation and anxiety among stroke patients. Stroke patients (able to consent) in a hospital rehabilitation unit were invited to participate in two weekly AT sessions for 6 weeks  facilitated by an art psychotherapist using paints  crayons  clay  a camera and an iPad. Hospital anxiety and depression scales (HAD) and therapy outcome measures (TOM) were measured at the beginning and end of the study. Six male patients were recruited  average age 69 years (38-85). Group discussions allowed patients to express openly feelings of frustration as well as hope for physical and emotional recovery: 'fight like a ferret'  an expression used by a group member. The group produced several art objects and photographic images that were collated using stop-frame animation to produce a 10 min film. Median HAD score for the group was eight points upon entering the study and six points on finishing the study. There is little attention to the emotional needs of stroke patients in rehabilitation. Properly designed research studies exploring the role of AT in addressing anxiety and depression poststroke are needed. Our study showed that AT was a feasible intervention that helped patients explore the sequel of stroke in an open supportive environment.
Evidence-Based Medicine,Pediatrics,,Translating Atopic Dermatitis Management Guidelines Into Practice for Primary Care Providers. Atopic dermatitis affects a substantial number of children  many of whom seek initial treatment from their pediatrician or other primary care provider. Approximately two-thirds of these patients have mild disease and can be adequately managed at the primary care level. However  recent treatment guidelines are written primarily for use by specialists and lack certain elements that would make them more useful to primary care providers. This article evaluates these recent treatment guidelines in terms of evaluation criteria  treatment recommendations  usability  accessibility  and applicability to nonspecialists and integrates them with clinical evidence to present a streamlined severity-based treatment model for the management of a majority of atopic dermatitis cases. Because each patient's situation is unique  individualization of treatment plans is critical as is efficient communication and implementation of the plan with patients and caregivers. Specifically  practical suggestions for individualizing  optimizing  implementing  and communicating treatment plans such as choosing a moisturizer formulation  avoiding common triggers  educating patients/caregivers  providing written treatment plans  and scheduling physician follow-up are provided along with a discussion of available resources for patients/caregivers and providers.
Nursing Methodology Research,,,Spiritual care perspectives of Danish registered nurses. A Gadamerian hermeneutic phenomenological methodology was selected to explicate the essence of spiritual care with six registered nurses working within hospital settings. Findings revealed that deep knowing of the patient was essential before registered nurses would engage in spiritual care. Furthermore  spirituality was understood as a private matter  with chaplains being seen as the most appropriate providers of such care. These findings suggest that within the culture of Danish nursing  a mandate to incorporate spiritual care into everyday nursing practice may be somewhat problematic.
Pharmacology,,,Can we discover pharmacological promiscuity early in the drug discovery process? The term 'pharmacological promiscuity' describes the activity of a single compound against multiple targets. When undesired  promiscuity is a major safety concern that needs to be detected as early as possible in the drug discovery process. The analysis of large datasets reveals that the majority of promiscuous compounds are characterized by recognizable molecular properties and structural motifs  the most important one being a basic center with a pK(a)(B)>6. These compounds interact with a small set of targets such as aminergic GPCRs; some of these targets attract surprisingly high hit rates. In this review  we discuss current trends in the assessment of pharmacological promiscuity and propose strategies to enable early detection and mitigation.
Specialization,,,Physicians using ultrasound in Danish emergency departments are mostly summoned specialists. Emergency ultrasound is a relatively new diagnostic discipline. It is used as an extension of the clinical examination and is ideal in the setting of acute illness. The objective of this study was to investigate how many Emergency Departments (EDs) in Denmark have implemented emergency ultrasound. We also wanted to give an idea of how many and which physicians have adopted ultrasound as a diagnostic tool so far. The study was a cross-sectional  descriptive  multicenter survey that included all physician staffed EDs in Denmark. An Internet based questionnaire was distributed by e-mail to all heads of department. Those departments who responded that ultrasound was available in their department were included in the second part of the study where all physicians working in the ED were contacted and asked to complete a second questionnaire. All 28 eligible EDs participated in the first part of the study (Response rate: 100 %). 25 EDs (89 %  95 % CI: 85-93) had ultrasound equipment available. Questionnaires were distributed to 1 872 physicians in these departments and 561 responded (Response rate: 30 %  95 % CI: 28-32). Overall 257 (46 %  95 % CI: 42-50) were users of emergency ultrasound and 304 were non-users (54 %  95 % CI: 50-58). The largest group with 146 respondents (25 %  95 % CI: 21-29) were anaesthetists with merely consult duty in the ED. When looking exclusively on physicians with on-call duty in the ED  thus excluding anaesthetists  only 146 (35 %  95 % CI: 30-40) were users of ultrasound while 269 (65 %  95 % CI: 60-70) were non-users. There was a considerable difference regarding age  level of training  and medical specialty between users and non-users. Users were mainly anaesthetists and attending physicians from other departments. The majority of non-users were young physicians with on call duty in the ED. We have found that although almost all Danish EDs have ultrasound equipment available  few physicians working in the ED seem to have adopted the tool. Emergency Ultrasound is mainly performed by specialists who are summoned to the ED in case of severe acute illness and not by those physicians who comprise the backbone of the ED around the clock.
Gynecology,,,[Quality monitoring based on data from the Danish National Patient Registry]. The Danish National Patient Registry (DNRP) was established in Denmark in 1976  and since then in accordance with current law  it has been collecting discharge diagnoses  surgical codes and recently also different diagnostic and treatment codes from all Danish hospitals. Besides being an administrative tool and a tool for epidemiological research through recent years  the DNPR has also supported national clinical quality databases. We report the experiences from a national quality control in Danish reproductive gynaecology based on data from the DNPR. We conclude that the NRP is a suitable tool for continuous clinical quality control  and discuss ways of improving the validity of DNPR data.
Telepathology,,,Assessment of static telecytological diagnoses' reproducibility in cervical smears prepared by means of liquid-based cytology. This study evaluated the accuracy and reproducibility of telecytological diagnoses proffered on the basis of digitized images from cervical smears prepared by means of liquid-based cytology. Representative digital cytological images from a total of 404 cervical smears (benign  135; atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance  92; low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion  62; high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion  87; squamous cell carcinoma  26; and adenocarcinoma  2) were uploaded to the CytoTrainer e-learning telecytology platform (developed in the Department of Cytopathology  "ATTIKON" University General Hospital  Athens  Greece) with specific password-protected accounts and were reviewed remotely by four independent board-certified cytopathologists (checking round). Their reports were recorded and classified. After 12 and 24 months  the same representative digital images were transferred in random order to the same cytopathologists and were reviewed again (first and second review rounds  respectively). The cytopathologists' first and second round diagnoses were recorded and compared with their initial ones. Statistical evaluation of cytological diagnoses detected no significant difference in diagnostic accuracy among checking and review diagnoses. The overall interobserver agreement was almost perfect with κ values of 0.79-0.97  whereas intraobserver agreement ranged from almost perfect to perfect with κ values of 0.76-1 in all diagnostic rounds. Digital images of cervical smears can be used for rapid and accurate diagnosis  by diminishing turnaround times and improving small cytology departments' quality indices. Diagnoses made by using static telecytological systems can be as reliable as those made by using conventional microscopy  under the conditions that representative images are taken and that standard cytological diagnostic criteria are applied. Telecytology can be used as an alternative method for the cytologic diagnosis of cervical smears  particularly in quality assurance programs.
Global Health,,,Safety and Efficacy of New-Generation Drug-Eluting Stents in Women at High Risk for Atherothrombosis: From the Women in Innovation and Drug-Eluting Stents Collaborative Patient-Level Pooled Analysis. The safety and efficacy of new-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) in women with multiple atherothrombotic risk (ATR) factors is unclear. We pooled patient-level data for women enrolled in 26 randomized trials. Study population was categorized based on the presence or absence of high ATR  which was defined as having history of diabetes mellitus  prior percutaneous or surgical coronary revascularization  or prior myocardial infarction. The primary end point was major adverse cardiovascular events defined as a composite of all-cause mortality  myocardial infarction  or target lesion revascularization at 3 years of follow-up. Out of 10 449 women included in the pooled database  5333 (51%) were at high ATR. Compared with women not at high ATR  those at high ATR had significantly higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (15.8% versus 10.6%; adjusted hazard ratio: 1.53; 95% confidence interval: 1.34-1.75; P=0.006) and all-cause mortality. In high-ATR risk women  the use of new-generation DES was associated with significantly lower risk of 3-year major adverse cardiovascular events (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.69; 95% confidence interval: 0.52-0.92) compared with early-generation DES. The benefit of new-generation DES on major adverse cardiovascular events was uniform between high-ATR and non-high-ATR women  without evidence of interaction (Pinteraction=0.14). At landmark analysis  in high-ATR women  stent thrombosis rates were comparable between DES generations in the first year  whereas between 1 and 3 years  stent thrombosis risk was lower with new-generation devices. Use of new-generation DES even in women at high ATR is associated with a benefit consistent over 3 years of follow-up and a substantial improvement in very-late thrombotic safety.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Avicenna's doctrine and institutional review board in international bio-medical research. Avicenna  an outstanding Persian physician and philosopher (980 AD-1037 AD)  established a clinical treaty  or doctrine  without which medical experimentation would not have progressed. This doctrine emphasizes the ultimate divine power of God or a higher being over healing and mandates the patients' well-being as the crucial aspect in all medical care and experiments. The Institutional Review Board  as the ethical body that oversees clinical research  is in line with this doctrine. However  the lack of a homogenous and internationally recognized code of ethics  the decentralized work of ethics oversight committees  the improper implementation of established ethical standards and a shortage of scientific auditing capacities have raised concerns over the possible exploitation of vulnerable populations.
Ophthalmology,,,Nordic research in ophthalmology. To provide an overview of some of the current activities in eye research in the Nordic countries. The presentations at the biannual Nordic Congress of Ophthalmology  held in Tampere  Finland in 2002  were reviewed and the contributions found most noteworthy are included in this article along with a limited discussion of each research field. However  space requirements prevented the inclusion of many interesting scientific contributions. Important contributions in various subfields of eye research and ophthalmology are reviewed. These include cornea  cataract  paediatric ophthalmology  glaucoma  diabetic eye disease  age-related macular degeneration  physiology and pharmacology and oncology. Eye research is very active in the Nordic countries and significant contributions are being made to ophthalmology in several fields on a world scale. We hope to continue to review Nordic contributions to eye research after each Nordic Congress of Ophthalmology and plan to make the reviews more systematic and comprehensive in the future.
Family Practice,,,Screening and brief intervention targeting risky drinkers in Danish general practice--a pragmatic controlled trial. Recommendations for routine alcohol screening and brief counselling intervention in primary health care rest on results from intervention efficacy studies. By conducting a pragmatic controlled trial (PCT)  we aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of the WHO recommendations for screening and brief intervention (SBI) in general practice. A randomized PCT (brief counselling intervention vs no intervention) involving 39 Danish general practitioners (GPs). Systematic screening of 6897 adults led to inclusion of 906 risky drinkers  and research follow-up on 537 of these after 12-14 months. Outcome measures focused on patients' acceptance of screening and intervention and their self-reported alcohol consumption. Patient acceptance of screening and intervention -10.3% (N = 794) of the target population (N = 7  691) explicitly refused screening. All intervention group subjects (N = 442) were exposed to an instant brief counselling session while only 17.9% of them (79/442) attended a follow-up consultation that was offered by their GP. Consumption Changes At one-year follow-up  average weekly consumption had increased by 0.7 drinks in both comparison groups. As secondary findings  we observed an indiscriminate absolute risk reduction (ARR = 0.08 (95% CI: -0.02; 0.18)) in male binge drinking  but adverse intervention effects for women on the secondary outcomes (binge drinking ARR = -0.30 (95% CI: -0.47; -0.09)). The results of brief interventions in everyday general practice performed on the basis of systematic questionnaire screening may fall short of theoretical expectations. When applied to non-selected groups in everyday general practice SBI may have little effect and engender diverse outcome. Women may be more susceptible to defensive reactions than men.
Family Practice,,,Screening in brief intervention trials targeting excessive drinkers in general practice: systematic review and meta-analysis. To determine the effectiveness of programmes of screening in general practice for excessive alcohol use and providing brief interventions. Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials that used screening as a precursor to brief intervention. General practice. Number needed to treat  proportion of patients positive on screening  proportion given brief interventions  and effect of screening. The eight studies included for meta-analysis all used health questionnaires for screening  and the brief interventions included feedback  information  and advice. The studies contained several sources of bias that might lead to overestimates of the effects of intervention. External validity was compromised because typically three out of four people identified by screening as excessive users of alcohol did not qualify for the intervention after a secondary assessment. Overall  in 1000 screened patients  90 screened positive and required further assessment  after which 25 qualified for brief intervention; after one year 2.6 (95% confidence interval 1.7 to 3.4) reported they drank less than the maximum recommended level. Although even brief advice can reduce excessive drinking  screening in general practice does not seem to be an effective precursor to brief interventions targeting excessive alcohol use. This meta-analysis raises questions about the feasibility of screening in general practice for excessive use of alcohol.
Family Practice,,,Screening and brief intervention for excessive alcohol use: qualitative interview study of the experiences of general practitioners. To explore the suitability of a screening based intervention for excessive alcohol use by describing the experiences of general practitioners who tried such an intervention in their everyday practice. Qualitative interviews with general practitioners who had participated in a pragmatic study of a combined programme of screening and a brief intervention for excessive alcohol use. Doctors were interviewed either individually or in focus groups. A computer based  descriptive  phenomenological method was used to directly analyse the digitally recorded interviews. 24 of 39 general practitioners in four Danish counties who volunteered to take part in the pragmatic study were interviewed. The doctors were surprised at how difficult it was to establish rapport with the patients who had a positive result on the screening and to ensure compliance with the intervention. Although the doctors considered the doctor-patient relationship robust enough to sustain targeting of alcohol use  they often failed to follow up on initial interventions  and some expressed a lack of confidence in their ability to counsel patients effectively on lifestyle issues. The doctors questioned the rationale of screening in young drinkers who may grow out of excessive drinking behaviour. The programme needed considerable resources  and it interrupted the natural course of consultations and was inflexible. The doctors could not recommend the screening and brief intervention programme  although they thought it important to counsel their patients on drinking. Screening for excessive alcohol use created more problems than it solved for the participating doctors. The results underline the value of carrying out pragmatic studies on the suitability of seemingly efficacious healthcare programmes.
Family Practice,,,How GPs implement clinical guidelines in everyday clinical practice--a qualitative interview study. Clinical guidelines are considered to be essential for improving quality and safety of health care. However  interventions to promote implementation of guidelines have demonstrated only partial effectiveness and the reasons for this apparent failure are not yet fully understood. To investigate how GPs implement clinical guidelines in everyday clinical practice and how implementation approaches differ between practices. Individual semi-structured open-ended interviews with seven GPs who were purposefully sampled with regard to gender  age and practice form. Interviews were recorded  transcribed verbatim and then analysed using systematic text condensation. Analysis of the interviews revealed three different approaches to the implementation of guidelines in clinical practice. In some practices the GPs prioritized time and resources on collective implementation activities and organized their everyday practice to support these activities. In other practices GPs discussed guidelines collectively but left the application up to the individual GP whilst others again saw no need for discussion or collective activities depending entirely on the individual GP's decision on whether and how to manage implementation. Approaches to implementation of clinical guidelines vary substantially between practices. Supporting activities should take this into account.
General Practice,,,Communicating risk using absolute risk reduction or prolongation of life formats: cluster-randomised trial in general practice. It is important that patients are well-informed about risks and benefits of therapies to help them decide whether to accept medical therapy. Different numerical formats can be used in risk communication but It remains unclear how the different formats affect decisions made by real-life patients. To compare the impact of using Prolongation Of Life (POL) and Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) information formats to express effectiveness of cholesterol-lowering therapy on patients' redemptions of statin prescriptions  and on patients' confidence in their decision and satisfaction with the risk communication. Cluster-randomised clinical trial in general practices. Thirty-four Danish GPs from 23 practices participated in a primary care-based clinical trial concerning use of quantitative effectiveness formats for risk communication in health prevention consultations. GPs were cluster-randomised (treating practices as clusters) to inform patients about cardiovascular mortality risk and the effectiveness of statin treatment using either POL or ARR formats. Patients' redemptions of statin prescriptions were obtained from a regional prescription database. The COMRADE questionnaire was used to measure patients' confidence in their decision and satisfaction with the risk communication. Of the 240 patients included for analyses  112 were allocated to POL information and 128 to ARR. Patients redeeming a statin prescription totalled six (5.4%) when informed using POL  and 32 (25.0%) when using ARR. The level of confidence in decision and satisfaction with risk communication did not differ between the risk formats. Patients redeemed statin prescriptions less often when their GP communicated treatment effectiveness using POL compared with ARR.
Family Practice,,,[Low income and number of contacts with general practice]. The purpose of this study was to examine whether there are differences in the use of general practice between citizens in low income groups and citizens with higher income after adjustment for social and health-related factors. Registers from Statistics Denmark on adult citizens of Odense Municipality in 2005 were used. Income was measured as annual equivalent disposable income and adjustment for social and health-related personal characteristics was performed using Poisson regression. Poor adults with income below 73 000 DKK have 2-3 fewer contacts with general practice annually than those with an income of 73 000-146 000 DKK  while adults with an income above 292 000 DKK have the lowest utilization of general practice of any group. The difference between the poor and those with low income was reduced to 1.5 fewer contacts after adjustment for social and health-related characteristics and further to 1 1 when a sizeable unidentified socio-economic group was omitted. Poor adults have significantly fewer contacts with general practice than adults with low or middle income. This contrasts with results from earlier studies and may be an indication of underutilization of general practice. Other explanations may be that poor citizens enter the primary health sector through other channels or that the type and quality of contacts vary between income groups  that adjustment for health or other need indicators are insufficient. Furthermore  data shortcomings such as lack of information on non-taxed income and non-taxable assets may also serve as alternative explanations.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Use of an integrated care pathway: a third round audit of the management of shoulder pain in neurological conditions. To complete a third round audit of management of shoulder pain using an integrated care pathway  to evaluate pro forma documentation and to determine outcome. Thirty-four patients with upper limb paresis admitted to a rehabilitation unit during a 22-month period had shoulder pain and were included in the integrated care pathway. Retrospective review of pro forma documentation against pre-determined standards. Compared with the second round audit  performance against 5 out of 9 standards for initial assessment and documentation had improved  and ranged from 56% to 94%. Achievement of 9 further standards relating to continued management ranged from 44% to 97%. Variance was not always well recorded. Shoulder pain resolved or improved in 18/34 (53%) of patients. Introducing the pro forma improved standards of documentation and demonstrated a positive outcome in over half the patients. Some problems with developing and maintaining integrated care pathways in the context of rehabilitation are discussed.
Emergency Medicine,,,Developing an emergency ultrasound app - a collaborative project between clinicians from different universities. Focused emergency ultrasound is rapidly evolving as a clinical skill for bedside examination by physicians at all levels of education. Ultrasound is highly operator-dependent and relevant training is essential to ensure appropriate use. When supplementing hands-on focused ultrasound courses  e-learning can increase the learning effect. We developed an emergency ultrasound app to enable onsite e-learning for trainees. In this paper  we share our experiences in the development of this app and present the final product.
Neurological Rehabilitation,Occupational Therapy,Rehabilitation,[Neurorehabilitation in Parkinson's disease]. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease which is characterized by the cardinal symptoms akinesia  rigidity  rest tremor and postural instability. Besides PD features also a wide range of non-motor symptoms. Physical activity is recommended for all stages of PD and may hypothetically even have a positive influence on the course of the disease. Rehabilitative treatments become increasingly important in the advanced stage of the disease and include mainly physiotherapy  occupational therapy and speech therapy. Neurorehabilitation is arguably most important for the treatment of axial symptoms such as freezing  hypophonia  dysphagia  postural instability and postural disturbances that respond poorly to drug therapy. This article provides an overview of current developments in the field of neurorehabilitation in PD.
Molecular Epidemiology,,,Rapid first-line discrimination of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains using MALDI-TOF MS. Fast and reliable discrimination of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates is essential in identifying an outbreak. Molecular typing methods  such as S. aureus protein A (spa) typing  multi locus sequence typing (MLST) and pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) are generally used for this purpose. These methods are all relatively time-consuming and not performed routinely in all laboratories. The aim of this study is to examine whether MALDI-TOF MS can be used as a fast  simple and easily implemented method for first-line discrimination of MRSA isolates. Mass spectra from 600 clinical MRSA isolates were included in the study  representing 89 spa types  associated with 16 different known clonal complexes. All spectra were obtained directly from colony material obtained from overnight cultures without prior protein extraction. We identified 43 useful discriminatory m/z-values (peaks) and used a concept of arranging these peaks into pairs or small clusters within a small mass range  allowing for quality control of the spectra obtained. Using this concept we could reproducibly characterise and arrange the isolates into 26 MALDI-TOF groups  which strongly correlated with spa types and clonal complexes. The results of this study clearly show that MALDI-TOF MS can be used for first-line discrimination of MRSA isolates  using a simple and fast method that is easy to implement as part of routine testing.
Pediatrics,,,Importance of blood cultures from peripheral veins in pediatric patients with cancer and a central venous line. When an infection is suspected in a child with cancer and a central venous line (CVL)  cultures are often only obtained from the CVL and not from a peripheral vein (PV). This study was undertaken to evaluate the importance of concomitant blood cultures from the CVL and a PV. Clinical data and the results of all cultures taken concomitantly from the CVL and a PV were registered prospectively in children admitted with fever from April 2008 to December 2012 at the Department of Pediatrics at Aarhus University Hospital Skejby. During the study period 654 paired cultures obtained from the CVL and from a PV within two hour of each other were included. A true bloodstream infection (BSI) was registered in 112 episodes. In 20 (17%) out of 112  true BSI growth of a microorganism was detected only in the culture from a PV including seven cases of Escherichia coli and three cases of Staphylococcus aureus. In 52 episodes the same microorganism was cultured from both the CVL and a PV. Twenty-four of these episodes were classified as catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) using differential time to positivity. In total  64 (57%) of all true BSI were defined as CRBSI. Blood cultures should be obtained from a PV in addition to cultures from CVL at the onset of fever in pediatric patients with cancer in order to maximize the findings of true BSIs. The frequency of CRBSI may be over-estimated if blood cultures are drawn from CVL only.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Chemotherapeutic wafers in treatment of malignant cerebral glioma. Assessment of a Cochrane review]. The present Cochrane review deals with implantation of chemotherapeutic wafers in the surgical cavity after resection of a malignant glioma. The authors found two controlled  randomised studies concerning this treatment modality after first-time surgical treatment and one study dealing with treatment of recurrent tumour. An effect was shown in the first with an increase in median survival of 2 months equivalent to the survival seen after standard (concomitant) treatment. No effect was shown in recurrent tumour.
Precision Medicine,,,Benefit from procarbazine  lomustine  and vincristine in oligodendroglial tumors is associated with mutation of IDH. Patients with 1p/19q codeleted anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors who participated in RTOG (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group) 9402 lived much longer after chemoradiotherapy (CRT) than radiation therapy (RT) alone. However  some patients with noncodeleted tumors also benefited from CRT; survival curves separated after the median had been reached  and significantly more patients lived ≥ 10 years after CRT than RT. Thus  1p/19q status may not identify all responders to CRT. Using trial data  we inquired whether an IDH mutation or germ-line polymorphism associated with IDH-mutant gliomas identified the patients in RTOG 9402 who benefited from CRT. IDH status was evaluable in 210 of 291 patients; 156 (74%) had mutations. rs55705857 was evaluable in 245 patients; 76 (31%) carried the G risk allele. Both were associated with longer progression-free survival after CRT  and mutant IDH was associated with longer overall survival (9.4 v 5.7 years; hazard ratio [HR]  0.59; 95% CI  0.40 to 0.86; P = .006). For those with wild-type tumors  CRT did not prolong median survival (1.3 v 1.8 years; HR  1.14; 95% CI  0.63 to 2.04; P = .67) or 10-year survival rate (CRT  6% v RT  4%). Patients with codeleted mutated tumors (14.7 v 6.8 years; HR  0.49; 95% CI  0.28 to 0.85; P = .01) and noncodeleted mutated tumors (5.5 v 3.3 years; HR  0.56; 95% CI  0.32 to 0.99; P < .05) lived longer after CRT than RT. IDH mutational status identified patients with oligodendroglial tumors who did (and did not) benefit from alkylating-agent chemotherapy with RT. Although patients with codeleted tumors lived longest  patients with noncodeleted IDH-mutated tumors also lived longer after CRT.
Pediatrics,,,The updated European Consensus 2009 on the use of Botulinum toxin for children with cerebral palsy. An interdisciplinary European group of clinical experts in the field of movement disorders and experienced Botulinum toxin users has updated the consensus for the use of Botulinum toxin in the treatment of children with cerebral palsy (CP). A problem-orientated approach was used focussing on both published and practice-based evidence. In part I of the consensus the authors have tabulated the supporting evidence to produce a concise but comprehensive information base  pooling data and experience from 36 institutions in 9 European countries which involves more than 10 000 patients and over 45 000 treatment sessions during a period of more than 280 treatment years. In part II of the consensus the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) and Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) based Motor Development Curves have been expanded to provide a graphical framework on how to treat the motor disorders in children with CP. This graph is named "CP(Graph) Treatment Modalities - Gross Motor Function" and is intended to facilitate communication between parents  therapists and medical doctors concerning (1) achievable motor function  (2) realistic goal-setting and (3) treatment perspectives for children with CP. The updated European consensus 2009 summarises the current understanding regarding an integrated  multidisciplinary treatment approach using Botulinum toxin for the treatment of children with CP.
Chiropractic,Orthopedics,,Reproducibility of range of motion and muscle strength measurements in patients with hip osteoarthritis - an inter-rater study. Assessment of range of motion (ROM) and muscle strength is fundamental in the clinical diagnosis of hip osteoarthritis (OA) but reproducibility of these measurements has mostly involved clinicians from secondary care and has rarely reported agreement parameters. Therefore  the primary objective of the study was to determine the inter-rater reproducibility of ROM and muscle strength measurements. Furthermore  the reliability of the overall assessment of clinical hip OA was evaluated. Reporting is in accordance with proposed guidelines for the reporting of reliability and agreement studies (GRRAS). In a university hospital  four blinded raters independently examined patients with unilateral hip OA; two hospital orthopaedists independently examined 48 (24 men) patients and two primary care chiropractors examined 61 patients (29 men). ROM was measured in degrees (deg.) with a standard two-arm goniometer and muscle strength in Newton (N) using a hand-held dynamometer. Reproducibility is reported as agreement and reliability between paired raters of the same profession. Agreement is reported as limits of agreement (LoA) and reliability is reported with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Reliability of the overall assessment of clinical OA is reported as weighted kappa. Between orthopaedists  agreement for ROM ranged from LoA [-28-12 deg.] for internal rotation to [-8-13 deg.] for extension. ICC ranged between 0.53 and 0.73  highest for flexion. For muscle strength between orthopaedists  LoA ranged from [-65-47N] for external rotation to [-10 -59N] for flexion. ICC ranged between 0.52 and 0.85  highest for abduction. Between chiropractors  agreement for ROM ranged from LoA [-25-30 deg.] for internal rotation to [-13-21 deg.] for flexion. ICC ranged between 0.14 and 0.79  highest for flexion. For muscle strength between chiropractors  LoA ranged between [-80-20N] for external rotation to [-146-55N] for abduction. ICC ranged between 0.38 and 0.81  highest for flexion. Weighted kappa for the overall assessment of clinical hip OA was 0.52 between orthopaedists and 0.65 between chiropractors. Reproducibility of goniometric and dynamometric measurements of ROM and muscle strength in patients with hip OA is poor between experienced orthopaedists and between experienced chiropractors. Orthopaedists and chiropractors can to a moderate degree differentiate between hips with or without osteoarthritis.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,Diagnosis and treatment of primary myelodysplastic syndromes in adults: recommendations from the European LeukemiaNet. Within the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) work package of the European LeukemiaNet  an Expert Panel was selected according to the framework elements of the National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Program. A systematic review of the literature was performed that included indexed original papers  indexed reviews and educational papers  and abstracts of conference proceedings. Guidelines were developed on the basis of a list of patient- and therapy-oriented questions  and recommendations were formulated and ranked according to the supporting level of evidence. MDSs should be classified according to the 2008 World Health Organization criteria. An accurate risk assessment requires the evaluation of not only disease-related factors but also of those related to extrahematologic comorbidity. The assessment of individual risk enables the identification of fit patients with a poor prognosis who are candidates for up-front intensive treatments  primarily allogeneic stem cell transplantation. A high proportion of MDS patients are not eligible for potentially curative treatment because of advanced age and/or clinically relevant comorbidities and poor performance status. In these patients  the therapeutic intervention is aimed at preventing cytopenia-related morbidity and preserving quality of life. A number of new agents are being developed for which the available evidence is not sufficient to recommend routine use. The inclusion of patients into prospective clinical trials is strongly recommended.
Evidence-Based Medicine,,,[Pharmaceutical treatment of cancer-associated fatigue--a survey of a Cochrane review]. The data and the conclusions of the Cochrane review of drug therapy for the management of cancer related fatigue (CRF) is analysed and summarized in this report. Overall  data is weakened substantially by a high degree of heterogeneity that stems primarily from the fact that fatigue is a subjective and multidimensional phenomenon Apart from erythropoietin and to some degree methylphenidate  there is no evidence that pharmacologic intervention may reduce CRF. CRF has major impact on quality of life for most patients suffering from a cancer disease. It is therefore of obvious importance to increase the focus on CRF - both in the pharmaceutical industry and in the professional-medical environment.
Family Practice,,,Delay in diagnosis of lung cancer in general practice. Lung cancer is a common cancer disease; nevertheless  in Denmark a GP only sees one new case of lung cancer per year. The core symptoms of lung cancer  cough and dyspnoea  are on the other hand very common in general practice. This represents a challenge to the diagnostic process and increases the risk of diagnostic delay. To explore diagnostic delay in primary health care among patients with lung cancer. A population based observational case series of 84 lung cancer patients' delay. The County of Aarhus  Denmark. From county-based registers of all histological and cytological tests we identified all patients in the County of Aarhus with lung cancer diagnosed during a 6 month period in 2003. Inclusion was verified by contacting the departments involved in the treatment of lung cancer. Data were based on telephone interviews with patients' GPs. A review of delay was made starting with the first symptom until referral to secondary care. The overall median delay in primary health care was 32.5 days (interquartile interval (IQI) = 12-68 days). One-third of the patients were referred to the diagnostic investigation after their first consultation. Important reasons for delay in primary care were: symptoms not related to the lungs  chest X-ray without suspicion of cancer  comorbidity  waiting times for investigations and lack of explicit follow-up appointment. Prolonged delay was often due to a combination of these factors. When diagnosing lung cancer  it is important that GPs are aware of the low sensitivity of chest X-ray. Shorter waiting times for investigations could reduce delay considerably.
Family Practice,,,[General practitioners' attitudes towards the diagnosis of lung cancer and the diagnostic organisation]. The aim of this study was to determine whether there is a nihilistic attitude towards diagnosing lung cancer among Danish general practitioners (GPs) and to obtain the GPs' evaluation of the present approach to lung cancer diagnosis. A questionnaire was sent to 1 186 randomly selected GPs. Most of the questions addressed the possibilities of improving primary prevention  GPs' attitudes towards diagnosing lung cancer  their opinions about waiting times and their clinical practice. A total of 848 (71%) completed the questionnaire. Only 12% agreed with the statement that the prognosis for lung cancer is so unfavourable that there is no hurry to diagnose the disease  while 22% agreed to the statement that diagnostic delay rarely means anything for the prognosis. About half of the GPs found the diagnostic period too long. There were  however  wide variations among the different counties in Denmark. The majority of GPs followed the recommendations of the Danish Lung Cancer Group for diagnosing lung cancer  especially the elderly GPs  who were also more inclined to make follow-up appointments after lung infections. More than one in every four practitioners was reluctant to use the word "cancer" in referrals to hospitals or for investigation. The study showed that Danish GPs do not have a nihilistic attitude towards diagnosing lung cancer and that elderly practitioners are more careful about diagnosing lung cancer. GPs' satisfaction with waiting times varies widely among the different counties in Denmark. Many practitioners were reluctant to use the word "cancer" in referrals.
Molecular Epidemiology,,,The Glioma International Case-Control Study: A Report From the Genetic Epidemiology of Glioma International Consortium. Decades of research have established only a few etiological factors for glioma  which is a rare and highly fatal brain cancer. Common methodological challenges among glioma studies include small sample sizes  heterogeneity of tumor subtypes  and retrospective exposure assessment. Here  we briefly describe the Glioma International Case-Control (GICC) Study (recruitment  2010-2013)  a study being conducted by the Genetic Epidemiology of Glioma International Consortium that integrates data from multiple data collection sites  uses a common protocol and questionnaire  and includes biospecimen collection. To our knowledge  the GICC Study is the largest glioma study to date that includes collection of blood samples  which will allow for genetic analysis and interrogation of gene-environment interactions.
Public Health,,,Industrial Food Animal Production and Community Health. Industrial food animal production (IFAP) is a source of environmental microbial and chemical hazards. A growing body of literature suggests that populations living near these operations and manure-applied crop fields are at elevated risk for several health outcomes. We reviewed the literature published since 2000 and identified four health outcomes consistently and positively associated with living near IFAP: respiratory outcomes  methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)  Q fever  and stress/mood. We found moderate evidence of an association of IFAP with quality of life and limited evidence of an association with cognitive impairment  Clostridium difficile  Enterococcus  birth outcomes  and hypertension. Distance-based exposure metrics were used by 17/33 studies reviewed. Future work should investigate exposure through drinking water and must improve exposure assessment with direct environmental sampling  modeling  and high-resolution DNA typing methods. Investigators should not limit study to high-profile pathogens like MRSA but include a broader range of pathogens  as well as other disease outcomes.
Emergency Medicine,,,Full-text publication of abstracts in emergency medicine in Denmark. Abstracts presented at medical conferences or scientific meetings should ideally be published as full-text articles in peer-reviewed journals after initial presentation and feedback regardless of the findings. The aim of this survey was to determine the publication rate of papers presented at the Danish Emergency Medicine Conferences in 2009  2010 and 2011. Abstracts presented at the conferences were identified and authors contacted to obtain publication information. A further search was conducted using relevant databases. Publication rates for the 2009 and 2010 were approximately 30% (25-31.6%). The publication rate for the 2011 conference was 14.5% within 18 months with an additional 9% under review prior to publication.
